# Debunking the list of alleged atrocities committed by the United States
The purpose of this Repository project is to provide a 'living document' to correct the record and outright refute allegations made by political pundits (from across the political spectrum), that various US foreign and domestic policy actions were 'atrocities'. This correction and refutation is achieved via a close examination of primary source records (unclassified/declassified), as well as peer-reviewed, scholarly literature from world-leading experts in their corresponding fields. 

The issue with lists that claim to archive US "atrocities" is that they're created often by conspiracy theorists,<sup>[1](https://imgur.com/a/ipTt002)</sup></sup> who predominantly cite sensational headlines that are written by a layman who either have a strong biases, or simply lack familiarity with the subject matter to understand nuance and key information that'd be adverse to their conclusion, thus in just a simple error. 
They simply do not stand up to rudimentary factual or legal scrutiny.

This project also isn't to suggest the US is perfect, and has never done any wrong-doing, it has—but these rare occasions have been from individual service members, contractors, etc, that were not authorised, encouraged or in any way condoned. As this list will show, the US holds accountability for those who commit wrong-doing.
One can also disagree with a policy decision, but do not merely call it an atrocity because you disagree with it. 

Some readers who will find this Repo clashing with what they think they know to be true, may commit a number of fallacies in order to dismiss the content—the most prominent would be the genetic fallacy. To that, you should ask yourself the following: "If the declassified record supported my position, would I cite it?" The answer is always 'yes'. When examining primary source records, one must note that they're not all equal. Raw intel cables from a Station or an embassy, for example, should not be valued in the same light as finalised intelligence products. For Congressional investigations, keep in mind any disagreement between majority & minority, same for Agency/Department Inspectors General—management comments, Accountability Review Boards, should also be examined if they disagree. Not all Governments are monolithic; not all internal documents are treated the same. Yes, this means some investigations can get it wrong, as shown in this entry: E.g. 4 March, 2007; be them IG, 15-6, etc. AR 15-6 investigations, to the uninformed mind, can appear to lack independence—however, this is almost never the case and the fact-finding provided by them is invaluable. There has been revisions to AR 15-6 to adequately address such concerns.<sup>[1](https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/7766454/2017-WINTER-Administrative+Investigations+in+an+Era+of+Increased+Government+Scrutiny.pdf/f3ad2420-f4cd-4a00-8188-9a86bfbb9613)</sup></sup> Other investigative authorities exist, such as formal Court of Inquiry or an Inspector General, etc.

_Definition: An extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury._

_[Legal Definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825130159/https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.49_Framework%20of%20Analysis%20for%20Atrocity%20Crimes_EN.pdf): The  term  “atrocity  crimes”  refers  to  three  legally  defined  international  crimes:    genocide, crimes against  humanity  and  war  crimes._ 

[Per the ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/UICCEng.pdf), "The International Criminal Court is _not a substitute_ for national courts. According to the Rome Statute, it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. The International Criminal Court _can only intervene where a State is unable or unwilling genuinely to carry out the investigation and prosecute the perpetrators"_

> "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." 
 
   – President Barack  Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016

- On July 12, 2021, the Biden Administration issued its [report](https://www.state.gov/2021-report-to-congress-pursuant-to-section-5-of-the-elie-wiesel-genocide-and-atrocities-prevention-act-of-2018) to Congress Pursuant to Section 5 of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-441). "The Biden Administration is committed to promoting democratic values that underpin a stable international system critical to freedom, prosperity, and peace.  This Administration will defend and protect human rights around the world, and recognizes the prevention of atrocities is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility. This report highlights countries of concern and whole-of-government efforts undertaken by the Atrocity Early Warning Task Force to prevent and respond to atrocities."

- In 2016 and 2015, then-CIA Director John Brennan confirmed CIA's direct role in applying pressure to foreign Governments and individuals to abide by human rights, otherwise face consequences such as termination of cooperation. He confirmed that the CIA has followed through on its word, due to CIA's concerns.<sup>[1](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160713_cia_brennan_transcript.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/150806%20DCIA%20Brennan%20letter%20to%20Wyden[2].pdf)</sup></sup> This is in line with decades of CIA practice (see Western Hemisphere section).

## Alleged Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries.
This is misleading and in factual error.
  - Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present.
  - Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities.  An installation may consist of one or more sites.  

    The DoD has presence in only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sits as of [2018.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf) This is at the full [consent of host countries.](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)
  
- US Military presense abroad is popular among locals of host countries, where economies and stability increase.<sup>[1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/outside-the-wire-us-military-deployments-and-public-opinion-in-host-states/BEC8A7BA48C9CF5B82B100CCC4CFA56E)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR518.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X17738219?ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys&af=R)</sup></sup> 
- A comprehensive [examination](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002714560350) of 164 countries for the years 1981 to 2005 concludes, "the United States is likely to engage in military campaigns for humanitarian reasons that focus on human rights protection rather than for its own security interests such as democracy promotion or terrorism reduction... The present research finds that, beneath the greater consciousness concerning promotion of democracy and combating terrorism, human rights abuses emerge as the consistent trait among states that experience US military intervention... The empirical evidence of this study and the State Department statement led us to believe that the United States has a sustained interest in promoting human rights abroad rather than exclusively pursuing its security interests."

- "Over the past two years, I interviewed more than 130 officials about the century-long history of covert electoral interference, or concealed foreign efforts to manipulate democratic votes of succession. My interviewees included eight former CIA directors and many more CIA officers, as well as directors of national intelligence, secretaries of state, national security advisers, a KGB general, and a former U.S. president. I learned that in the twenty-first century, Washington’s senior-most national security officials have considered using the CIA to interfere in foreign elections at least twice. In one instance—in Serbia in 2000—debate turned into action, as the CIA spent millions of dollars working against the tyrant Slobodan Milosevic. In the other—in Iraq in 2005—the CIA stood down. In both instances, U.S. policymakers weighed the potential benefits of covert action against the perceived risks. These behind-the-scenes stories reveal why, contrary to Putin’s claims, Washington, unlike Moscow, has moved away from the practice of covert electoral interference." <sup>[1](https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/20/rigged-details-long-history-russian-and-us-electoral-interference)</sup></sup>

## Middle East
- On February 3rd, 2022, US troops conducted a raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. Civilians were killed as a result of him detonating a bomb, killing his family. US Special forces had tried to call for his surrender and offered him a path to survive.<sup>[1](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/News-Article-View/Article/2927256/mckenzie-says-isis-leader-who-died-during-us-raid-was-evil/)</sup></sup> 
- On December 18, 2021, NYT released [hundreds](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/civilian-casualty-files.html) of CIVCAS reports obtained through FOIA. Despite media coverage, a close examination of the files reveals nothing new, broadly. But does offer superior information into specific strikes media/NGOs either covered (or didn't). The core conclusions are reached upon a thorough review of the files:
  - 1. Most CIVCAS allegations were self-reported, long before or even with no media coverage.
  - 2. Vast majority of CIVCAS allegations coming from media/NGOs were off be a large order of magnitude, in: Dates, locations, and assessed number of people killed/injured, and causes. Most had no CIVCAS, buttressing official statements. 
  - 3. Confirms findings in CIVCAS reviews that SOPs, doctrine, policy, and laws (domestic & international), etc were followed in both dynamic and deliberate strikes. From strike authority to CIVCAS mitigation efforts.
  
  Note: Some files have been released previously under FOIA.

- On December 2, 2021, an independent Inspector General [review](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Dec/10/2002907413/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2021-084%20(REDACTED).PDF), dated May 2021, was declassified, it found CENTCOM's kinetic targeting procedures (intelligence vetting, Civilian Casualty mitigation, and approval authority) were adhered to, in operations in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Libya.

- On November 13, 2021, the New York Times ran a story that alleged there was a cover-up of a March 18, 2019 airstrike in Syria, from an F-25E.
  There are omissions in this article, along with other red flags that clearly indicate it was one-sided:
  - Striking an area, knowing some civilians are present, isn't a war crime or an IHL violation. This is permissible under the Geneva Conventions and international law determinations in Courts ever since WW2. <sup>[1](https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2021/11/15/the-law-the-baghuz-airstrike-and-accusations-of-a-possible-war-crime-and-cover-up/)</sup></sup>
  - According to the NYT, an independent IG investigation determined several such strikes were lawful, despite presense of civilians being known. 
  - COVID-19 delayed the IG's investigations, this was publicly acknowledged by the DoD. This was no attempt to "cover-up".
  - CENTCOM has verified that a Coalition drone operator reported to US forces they observed civilians killed in the strike. This prompted an immediate CIVCAS credibility assessment, which determined the allegation credible. This prompted an independent AR 15-6 investigation to look further into the cause.
  - Currently, an IG investigation is wrapping up (November 2021), which has examined the internal reporting of this case. I will update once its findings are public.
  The full statement from CENTCOM, which was provided to the NYT authors prior to publication, undercuts their story, Captain Bill Urban, US CENTCOM spokesperson, provided the following statement to DailyMail on November 14, 2021: 

  'In mid to late March of 2019, U.S., coalition and Syrian Democratic Forces had isolated the final remnants of the ISIS proclaimed territorial caliphate in Baghouz, Syria. The ISIS pocket included thousands of fighters and family members including women and children. The remaining fighters including some women and child combatants along with many ISIS family members, including some who were likely held against their will, decided to make a determined stand in an area that included buildings, tunnels and cliffs. Multiple entreaties to ISIS to allow family members to depart the area were rebuffed, and thousands of family members remained in the area of the fighting.

  'On March 18, 2019, five days before the end of the battle, as many as 200 ISIS fighters launched a determined counterattack on SDF and coalition forces that started around 4 a.m. local time, lasted numerous hours and resulted in more than 30 SDF casualties. After more than 6 hours of fighting and dozens of strikes, numerous U.S. manned and unmanned strike platforms had departed the area due to having expended all of their ordinance. ISIS fighters had inflicted high casualties on the SDF through small arms, rocket propelled grenades, indirect fire, improvised explosive devices and suicide bombings.

  'After 10 a.m. local time, an SDF position under heavy fire and in danger of being overrun called for defensive airstrikes on ISIS fighter positions. The SDF fighters reported the area clear of civilians, and the nearest U.S. special operations forces on the ground also reported that they could observe no civilians in the area. The only remaining U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the area at the time of the strike was only capable of providing standard definition full motion video (FMV) as high definition-capable UAVs that were on station earlier had departed following the expenditure of their ordinance. The remaining U.S. UAV had also expended all of its hellfire missiles and was unarmed at the time of the call. 

  'The U.S. UAV on station was unable to discern any civilians in the area at the time of the SDF request. The only remaining armed strike aircraft on scene at the time of the request for air support was a U.S. F-15 with precision guided 500-pound bombs. With the area reported clear of civilians, and SDF positions under fire, the special operations strike cell authorized two defensive strikes on ISIS positions with two 500-pound precision guided munitions from the F-15. The strikes were determined to have taken out at least 16 active ISIS fighters that were engaged in attacks on SDF positions.

  'Several hours after these two strikes, a coalition UAV operator, who was operating a coalition UAV in the area with high-definition full motion video reported to U.S. special operations forces that the UAV had observed possible civilians in the area at the time of the strike. As the U.S. strike cell was unaware of the presence of the coalition UAV, U.S. special operations forces did not have access to their feed at the time of the strike. In response to this report, U.S. special operations forces leaders initiated a civilian casualty credibility assessment which determined that the report of civilian casualties was credible and warranted a 15-6 investigation.

  'The civilian casualty credibility assessment and the 15-6 determined through the study of all available evidence including coalition high-definition video, that several locations unobserved by the U.S. UAV with men, women, and children likely received lethal effects from the strikes. The investigations concluded that at least 4 civilians were killed and 8 were wounded from these strikes. The investigations were unable to conclusively characterise the status of more than 60 other casualties that resulted from these strikes. The reason for this uncertainty is that multiple armed women and at least one armed child were observed in the video, and the exact mixture of armed and unarmed personnel could not be conclusively determined.

  'Likely, a majority of those killed were also combatants at the time of the strike, however, it is also highly likely that there were additional civilians killed by these two strikes.

  'The 15-6 investigation concluded that these two strikes were legitimate self-defense strikes in support of SDF forces under fire, that they were proportional due to the unavailability of smaller ordinance at the time of the request, and that appropriate steps were taken to rule out the presence of civilians at the time of the strike. To prevent unintended casualties in the future, the investigation recommended requiring high-definition video for similar strikes in the future, and the requirement for the strike cell to coordinate with any coalition surveillance assets in the area at the time of the strike, and those recommendations were implemented. Finally, in accordance with the findings, the investigating officer determined that no disciplinary actions were warranted.

  'We abhor the loss of innocent life and take all possible measures to prevent them. In this case, we self-reported and investigated the strike according to our own evidence and take full responsibility for the unintended loss of life. It is important to understand that ISIS decided to put their own families at risk when all avenues of escape were afforded to them. It is also important to note that some women and children, whether through indoctrination or choice, decided to take up arms in this battle and as such could not strictly be classified as civilians. Ultimately, the determined effort of U.S., coalition and SDF forces culminated the final territorial defeat of ISIS on March 23, 2019, but it did not come without a significant cost of U.S. and partner casualties or without the regrettable loss of civilian life.' <sup>[2](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/2844585/us-central-command-statement-to-correct-the-record-from-capt-bill-urban/)</sup></sup>


- On October 22 2021, A U.S. [airstrike](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2820408/us-strike-in-the-vicinity-of-suluk-syria-oct-22-2021/) conducted by an MQ-9 drone, in northwest Syria killed senior al-Qaeda leader Abdul Hamid al-Matar. 0 civilian casualties are assessed. 

- On August 29, 2021, US forces conducted an airstrike in [self-defense](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2756206/us-central-command-statement-on-defensive-strike-in-kabul/); believed to be an imminent ISIS-K threat to Hamad Karzai International airport, resulted in 10 civilian casualties. The details of the investigation were provided by General Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. Commander of U.S. Central Command. Its overall findings:
  - The initial compound from which the Toyota Corolla came from is a confirmed ISIS-K facility. Rocket attacks came from there, among other intel (post strike), upholding this assessment.
  - 60 sources of intel were coming in, indicating a white Toyota Corolla would be used for an attack.
  - 6 drones in total, over 8 hours, observed the movements.
  - The secondary explosives reported in post-review seem to indicate propane tanks detonated to the rear of the vehicle.
  - Weaponeering was completed to mitigate CIVCAS, such as delayed fuse, making sure no assessed civilians were near, etc.
  - All ROEs were followed on the time-sensitive target. 
  - A review was initiated within 24 hours of the incident. This was not prompted by the NYT article. 
   
   These findings from CENTCOM, were upheld by another independent, Air Force Inspector General [investigation](https://www.c-span.org/video/?515842-1/defense-department-briefing). <sup>[1](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2780738/general-kenneth-f-mckenzie-jr-commander-of-us-central-command-and-pentagon-pres/)</sup></sup> 

- On August 27, 2021, the United States conducted a counterterrorism airstrike via drone, against the ISIS-K planner responsible for the attack on the Hamid Karzai International Airport. [0 civilian casualties](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2755890/us-central-command-statement-on-counterterrorism-strike-on-isis-k-planner/) resulted from this operation. 

- On June 27, 2021, President Biden, authorised US Military [defensive precision airstrikes](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2672875/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/) against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region. The targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. Specifically, the U.S. strikes targeted operational and weapons storage facilities. These strikes were legal under US domestic and international law. 0 civilians were killed.

- On June 3, 2021, the US Department of Defense released its [annual](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/02/2002732834/-1/-1/0/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2020.PDF) civilian casualty report pursuant to Section 1057 of the 2018 NDAA, as amended.
 The report covers Calendar Year 2020 for Global Military operations. It assesses that in 2020, US Military operations resulted in 23 civilians killed and 10 injured. The report also updated the Department's previous casualty numbers from prior years. The DoD assessment is based off of all NGO, media, and foreign Government submissions, self-reporting, etc. Its methodology is superior to that of NGOs, as it relies on classified and sensitive methods to determine casualties, including footage before, during, and after each incident. The Department is also transparent in updating prior reporting to increase the numbers, should new credible information be discovered. The new report details the near completion of two independent studies required by Congress. 

- On May 1st, 2021, the Biden Administration declassified an [11-page document](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf) created under the Trump admin, that superseded Obama's policy framework dubbed "the [2013 PPG](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download)" that governs Counterterrorism (CT) operations Outside Areas of Active Hostilities. Like the Obama guidance, it keeps intact layered oversight and bureaucracy. Key takeaways from the 2017 Principles, Standards, and Procedures for US Direct Action Against Terrorist Targets, or, "PSP" for short, include:
  - >The law of armed conflict imposes important constraints on the ways in which the United States uses force abroad.
  - >Direct action will be discriminating and precise in order to avoid noncombatant casualties. The United States goes to extraordinary lengths to reduce the likelihood of noncombatant casualties in CT operations, exercising restraint as a matter of policy that often exceeds what is required by LOAC.
  - >Direct Action should be undertaken wherever practicable and consistent with US interests and applicable domestic and international law.
  - >The United States will continue to take extraordinary measures to ensure with near certainty that noncombatants will not be injured or killed in the course of operations, using all reasonably available information and means of verification.
    
   Among many more restrictions and layered oversight for target approval, and general preference for capture rather than kill missions.

- On February 25th, 2021, in his first month in Office, [President Biden approved](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/27/a-letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-and-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate-consistent-with-the-war-powers-resolution/) airstrikes on lawful infrastructure targets in eastern Syria used by Iran-supported non-state militia groups. These groups were involved in recent attacks against civilians, US and coalition personnel. 0 civilians killed or wounded.

- On January 2nd, 2020, President Donald Trump [authorised a lawful](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6776446/Section-1264-NDAA-Notice.pdf) air strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of the IRGC-Qods Force, a [designated terrorist organisation.](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos.html) "As a matter of International Law, the strike targeting Soleimani in Iraq was taken in United States national self-defense, as recognised in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, in response to a series of escalating armed attacks that Iran and Iran-supported militias had already conducted against the United States." For an expert deep-dive, I recommend this [read](https://www.lawfareblog.com/was-soleimani-killing-assassination) by two world-leading experts. "General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region...He had orchestrated attacks...culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and [Iraqi personnel.](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)" Soleimani is a [well-documented](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-bloody-legacy-of-qasem-soleimani-11578093506) mass-murderer. His forces are known to rape innocent women on mass and committed many crimes against humanity and war crimes.

- On October 9, 2019, United Nations Mission Afghanistan released a report claiming US forces illegally struck drug facilities, resulting in civilian casualties. This report was [discredited](https://archive.org/details/USFORA-airstrike-response) for citing Jihadi propaganda websites, its deeply flawed legal examination, etc. From the response:
  
  > "United States Forces — Afghanistan (USFOR—A) disputes the findings, legal analysis, and methodology of the UNAMA report released. USFOR—A is concerned by the way UNAMA reached its conclusions and disagrees with their mischaracterization of the Taliban in the methamphetamine production facilities; their reliance on sources with conflicted motives or limited knowledge (including the Taliban propaganda website "Voice of Jihad"); and their narrow definition of legally targetable combatants.

  > By the time USFOR—A decided to conduct precision strikes, intelligence and operations professionals knew what the Taliban narcotics production facilities looked like, exactly where they were and who was allowed entry. USFOR—A and partner organizations also knew the pattern–of–life for their operations and locales. Under US legal definitions and rules and policies governing the conduct of war, and after exhaustive and comprehensive review of the facilities and those running them, USFOR—A and partner entities determined personnel in the labs were members of the Taliban and lawful military targets.

  > USFOR—A deliberately chose the targets and the timing for the strikes to avoid non-combatant casualties, striking during the daylight hours to maximize the ability to obtain and share site pictures which ensured we could verify the absence of civilians. On the day of operations, USFOR—A observation of the targeted sites used multiple surveillance platforms, including aircraft with full-motion video gathering capabilities. USFOR—A pre-strike processes included scores of hours of scrutiny of targeted sites to ensure we could verify non-combatants were not present. USFOR—A had degrees of certainty required at the time of the precision strikes to assess forces were only striking legal targets and avoiding non-combatant casualties and collateral damage. USFOR—A even declined to strike nearly a dozen production facilities due to even a slight possibility for civilian casualties.

  > The investigations leading to the identification and characterization of these methamphetamine production facilities, their ownership and oversight by the Taliban, the internal rules allowing entry only to Taliban combatants, as well as the flow of funds from these locations to Taliban operations, were combined operations with Afghan security partners. These operations against these Taliban revenue sources were planned and developed over the course of a year, drawing upon the expertise and resources of a wide array of interagency and inter-governmental organizations and relying upon extensive intelligence collection."
 

- In September 2019, a US drone strike targeted Da'esh terrorists in Nangarha province, according to Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. [Media alleged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-drones/u-s-drone-strike-kills-30-pine-nut-farm-workers-in-afghanistan-idUSKBN1W40NW) that 30 civilian farm workers were killed in the strike. However, according to the Department of Defense annual report on civilian casualties from US global operations covering CY19, only [8 civilians were incidentally killed](https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/06/2002295555/-1/-1/1/SEC-1057-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-MAY-1-2020.PDF), not 30. Strike was in accordance with international law.

- US Navy SEAL, Eddie Gallagher was alleged to have killed/injured innocent civilians. This [turned out](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/06/21/legal-bombshell-explodes-on-seal-war-crimes-trial/) to be a lie from his junior SEALs. Subsequently, Gallagher was [acquitted](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20476626-complete_gallagher_files_ocr) of all charges, but found guilty of one crime he never challenged: Posing for a photo with a body—something his SEAL colleagues also did, however, due to their immunities, they weren't charged.

- [On April 13, 2018](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/file/1067551/download), in coordination with the United Kingdom and France, the  United  States  attacked  three  facilities  associated  with  Syria’s  use  of  chemical weapons: the Barzeh Research and Development Center, the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons storage facility, and the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons bunker facility. There have been [many](https://dod.defense.gov/portals/1/features/2018/0418_syria/img/timeline.pdf) instances of the Syrian regime using these illegal weapons on innocent civilians, which is, of course, a war crime. [No civilians](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/1493658/briefing-by-secretarymattis-on-us-strikes-in-syria/) were killed or injured as a result of the US/UK/France attacks—as great care was taken to avoid them. Russia has [enabled]( https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/01/5_Lawless_StateofComplicity-1.pdf) the war crimes committed by the Syrian regime, and has also [committed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html) many themselves. Because Russia is allied with such a thuggish rogue state, and has committed heinous acts themselves, they must [deny](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2014/08/20/attempts-to-blame-the-syrian-opposition-for-the-august-21st-sarin-attacks-continue-one-year-on/), [lie](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/11/13/russia-accidentally-provide-best-evidence-syrian-governments-involvement-sarin-attacks/) and spin truth. Just as they did for their deliberate attack on civilian airline, [MH17](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) more than [once](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334396-2016-2017-ISC-AR.html) Russia has acted as a disinfo mill: Creating lies and spreading them far and wide. Through their proxy—wikileaks—Russia has spread fake news concerning a "whistleblower" in the OPCW via the leak of emails. That headline is enough to [convince](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md) some to believe Syria is innocent, simply because they don't want to spend the time to fact-check. Suffice to say, the disinformation has been covered, and debunked by the [OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2020/02/opcw-independent-investigation-possible-breaches-confidentiality-report), [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/15/the-opcw-douma-leaks-part-1-we-need-to-talk-about-alex/), and many others—including a sufficient skill at [reading comprehension.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/11/25/emails-and-reading-comprehension-opcw-douma-coverage-misses-crucial-facts/) To quote from the OPCW, "Inspector A, he was not a member of the FFM. As described by the investigators, Inspector A played a minor supporting role in the investigation of the Douma incident, and he did not have access to all of the information gathered by the FFM team, including witness interviews, laboratory results, and analyses by independent experts. Although Inspector A’s assessment purports to be an official OPCW FFM report on the Douma incident, it is instead a personal document created with incomplete information and without authorisation." 

- Starting in [June 2017](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/12/u-s-led-forces-accused-using-white-phosphorus-syria-iraq/), photos and videos from Raqqa, Syria claiming to have shown alleged US-backed groups "illegally" using white phosphorus. While it's hard to say who was deploying it—mere use of WP is not a war crime. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon told the Washington Post that the U.S. military only uses white phosphorus in “accordance with the law of armed conflict” – for example “for screening, obscuring and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures.” 
Other Coalition forces have used WP in this manner before, in other countries: Talking to NPR, New Zealand Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan said, "We have utilized white phosphorus to screen areas within west Mosul to get civilians out safely."
For an expert breakdown of the legality of WP, this [scholarly paper](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/08-2006.pdf) provides a fantastic breakdown, as does this [entry](https://www.lawfareblog.com/jus-bello-white-phosphorus-getting-law-correct) by another expert.

- A comprehensive, [independent study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048479-2018-Civilian-Casualty-Military-Study.html) from NDU, assessed US air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, between January 2015 to December 2017. The study pulled experts from Think Tanks and within the DoD, as well as establishing an NGO advisory panel. It consisted four components: 1) A literature, legal, and policy review; 2) analyses of quantitative data: strikes, civilian casualties, and US military assessments of civilian casualties; 3) semi-structured interviews with operators analysts, headquarters staff, and senior commanders, and 4) Roundtable discussions with NGOs.
  It reached four main findings:
  - Finding A.1. The delegation of Target Engagement Authority did not directly cause an increase in the rate of CIVCAS during OIR.
  - Finding A.2. There is clear written guidance and oversight regarding civilian casualty mitigation for deliberate and dynamic strikes. There is also widespread priority to minimize civilian casualties from the highest to lowest levels.
  - Finding A.3. Commanders throughout the chain of command exercised thorough oversight. These findings are consistent for declared theaters with Operating Principles that authorize direct action and Areas of Active Hostility, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Somalia, as well as Outside Areas of Active Hostility.
  - Finding A.4 The Positive Identification process has sufficient guidance and structure and therefore does not increase the risk for civilian casualties. 
    
    The review also found that US strikes rarely peaked above 5 CIVCAS over the 3 year period.

- On April 6, 2017, following the illegal [Khan Sheykkun chemical attack](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2017_904.pdf) [by the Syrian regime](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_evaluation_nationale_-_anglais_-_final_cle0dbf47-1.pdf), the United States carried out [lawful strikes](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Assessing_US_Justifications_for_Using-Force_2.pdf) against Al Shayrat airfield, used by the regime to conduct its illegal chemical & conventional weapons attacks against civilians. 

- A [study](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-us-military-receive-benefit-doubt-when-investigating-itself-alleged-war-crimes) by two world-leading experts concerning Iraq and Afghanistan US operations concludes, "We analyzed two sets of data dealing with these wars: the first, from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), details all founded investigations alleging serious law of armed conflict violations in Iraq and Afghanistan by Sailors, SEALs, and Marines; the second, from the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA), details all cases of alleged serious law of armed conflict violations by soldiers referred to court-martial. The NCIS data indicates that ninety-two allegations of serious law of armed conflict violations were substantiated, thirty-seven of which led to courts-martial (a number of others received non-judicial punishment), and twenty-eight of which resulted in conviction. The ACCA data shows 100 referred cases, of which seventy-eight resulted in conviction on at least one offense. Many of these cases resulted in substantial sentences, including life imprisonment."

- On March 17 2017, a US airstrike [accidentally killed](https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/cases/17-0341/1._ar_15_6_investigation__part_1___a__clear.pdf) 112 civilians in Mosul. Again, Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also, unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional munitions that resulted in a secondary explosives effect. Again, targeteering, and other CIVCAS mitigation efforts were all present to avoid civilians and collateral damage to the surrounding buildings. Forensic analysis confirms it was the secondary explosives that ISIS owned, that caused the civilian deaths.

- A 2017 [report](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/inspections/SIGAR%2017-47-IP.pdf), requested by Congress, examined between FY 2011–16, finds that the US investigated all allegations of human rights abuses committed by Afghan forces, including child abuse reports made externally and internally, as best they could and cut off aid to those units implicated. Convictions were landed on those who committed the crimes. The report does find some issues, and the agencies involved have their comments at the end. There wasn't a consolidated process, and as US forces drew down—they lacked the insights they once had into abuse allegations. 
  >"SIGAR found no evidence that U.S. forces were told to ignore human rights abuses or child sexual assault."

  >"Following the establishment of the State and Defense Leahy Vetting Procedures for the Afghan National Security Forces in July 2014, and a biweekly joint DOD and State Afghanistan Gross Violation of Human Rights Forum (Leahy Forum), the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD-P) began to track gross violation of human rights incidents—including child sexual assault—that were reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum. According to data provided by OUSD-P, as of August 12, 2016, the office was tracking 75 reported gross violation of human rights incidents. Of these reported incidents, 7 involved child sexual assault, 46 involved other gross violations of human rights, and 22 were classified at a level above Secret because of the sensitivity of the information or the sources and methods used to obtain the information. These incidents ranged in date from 2010 through 2016, and included gross violations of human rights allegedly committed by Afghan security forces within the MOD and MOI. The incidents reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum came from a variety of sources including intelligence reports, news articles, U.S. forces, and the Afghan government."
 
  >"Of the 75 reported incidents in the OUSD-P tracker, 7 involved allegations of child sexual assault—1 that the Leahy Forum found to be credible, 5 that remain under review, and 1 that was found not credible. Five of the seven involved MOI units, and two involved MOD units. The one credible incident was reported by the Afghan government. In this instance, the government reported that two ANA Special Operations Command (ANASOC) noncommissioned officers (NCOs) attempted to sexually assault a girl to coerce information from her mother. Following a trial, both NCOs were indicted and convicted for attempted sexual assault of a minor in violation of the penal code and sentenced to 6 years of confinement. Based on the information the Afghan government provided, DOD determined that it had credible information of a gross violation of human rights and began the process to remediate the unit." 

   Also details improvements made on the Afghan side including legislative, as well as other high-level efforts by the US Government working with the Afghans.
   It found no evidence, as NGOs/media alleged, that US forces were told to ignore child sex abuse/other human rights abuses.
   
- On 28 January 2017, President Trump authorised a Special Operations raid in al-Bayda, Yemen. The raid was successful, though tragic, in its collection highly important information. Media and NGOs claimed that during the raid, a firefight killed as many as 30 or more civilians. This however, was a hoax. According to declassified documents obtained by the ACLU, show that high resolution footage (covering many Points of View), and sensitive intelligence, confirm between [4-12](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf) civilian casualties. [Women also participated](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400/Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.pdf) in the fight. Classified documents also obtained by the ACLU show the mission was authorised because it satisfied the [NCV 0](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/17-L-0705JS022.pdf) policy. That is, if there was even the possibility that just one CIVCAS was possible, the mission could not be approved.

- From 2015 to 2020, the US had been [aiding](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390794-Acting-GC-Letter-to-Majority-Leader-Re-Sanders.html) the Saudi-led coalition in mid-air refuelling (outside Yemen airspace), International Humanitarian Law compliance, and limited intelligence sharing to help further mitigate impact to civilians. US & British Governments have worked well to train, advice and develop Saudi Arabia's international law compliance, according to a UK High Court [ruling](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf).

- In 2016, Obama released, per EO 13732 Sec. 3, data concerning High Value Target CT missions Outside Areas of Active Hostilities.
[The first](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF) report covers from Jan 2009 to Dec 2015. It shows that there was a total of 473 strikes with a total of between 2372-2581 combatants killed and only between 64-117 civilians killed. Following this, the [2016](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Summary-of-2016-Information-Regarding-United-States-Counterterrorism-Strikes-Outside-Areas-of-Active-Hostilities.pdf) report was issued, giving us: 53 total strikes. With 431-441 combatants killed and only 1 civilian killed. Both records make clear to refute the allegations that any "military-aged male" in area of target is deemed a combatant. To quote, "Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants."

- US involvement in Syria has concerned AQ and ISIS, since the regime has been either unwilling or unable to address the threat they pose to allied countries, such as the US. These nations are [allowed](https://lawfareblog.com/who-board-unwilling-or-unable) this right under [international law and a moral obligation to address these threats](https://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA484155766&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00948381&p=AONE&sw=w).

- From 2001 up to the present day, the drone campaign has resulted in disrupting many terrorist networks, and resulted in very few civilian casualties. Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the confirmation hearing for John Brennan, confirmed as a result of Congressional oversight, that the civilian deaths per year as a result of drone strikes is often in the [single digits](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/11331.pdf). Lethal strikes are only sought if [capture of HVTs is not feasible](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download). Leaked documents from the Intercept confirm that these missions (including ground raids) result in very few civilian casualties. From September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2012 in Afghanistan, out of a total of 2,082 missions only 14 civilians were killed or injured. That's 0.67%. Media have incorrectly claimed that these documents show a 90% civilian casualty rate from drone strikes. They neither are specific about drones nor, as shown, have a 90% CIVCAS stat—only a 0.67%.
Another document leaked confirms the time and care taken into approving each strike. Missions can only be approved by POTUS if the host nation consents. See [slide 6](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460856-small-footprint-operations-may-2013.html) and [slides 41 and 42](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460855-small-footprint-operations-february-2013.html).
From these, a picture starts to emerge:
  - The “average approval time” for a proposed strike under the AUMF process was 79 days. Even excluding the single longest approval, presumably an unrepresentative outlier, the average was 58 days. The fastest approval was 27 days.
  - These approvals were preceded by lengthy periods of gathering and analyzing intelligence on the targets—an average of six years.
  - Four out of 24 proposed concepts of operations covered by the study were disapproved under the AUMF review process.
  - The process for approving strikes under the AUMF “requires significant intel/ISR to justify (and maintain) approvals.” “Relatively few, high-level terrorists meet criteria for targeting” under this process. (Note that this isn’t a press release touting the program’s robust oversight; it’s an internal DOD assessment, written from the perspective of operators for whom a laborious approval process is an obstacle rather than a virtue.)
  - These “[p]olitical constraints” make these operations “challenging” and “fundamentally different from what we’ve experienced in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

- On 3 October, 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U accidentally misidentified the Kunduz Trauma Centre, operated by Doctors without Borders. Per an [independent investigation](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2819730/RESPONSIVE-DOCUMENTS.pdf), "The ground force and aircrew were unaware the aircrew was firing on a hospital throughout the course of the engagement." This was caused due to technical and human error. "Due to the early launch, the aircrew did not have the typical information it would have on a mission. While en route to Kunduz, one of the aircraft's critical communications systems failed, resulting in the aircraft's inability to receive and transmit certain critical information to multiple command headquarters." While tragic—this is not a war crime. While hospitals are indeed protected buildings under international law, there are caveats: 1. A building can lose its protected status. 2. A building can become [dual-status](https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/documents/AFD-081009-011.pdf), see page 84 of this scholarly paper—and yet, it's a [real thing, see page 6 of this investigation](https://archive.org/details/informal-ar-15-6-investigation-findings-and-recommendations-for-the-al-hawijah), not just in academic theory. If part of the building is used by combatants while the rest by civilians, only that area may be targeted. 3. An accident. Since the tribunals of WW2, there has been a principle formed known as the Rendulic standard. To quote from the [2020 updated Operational Law Handbook](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/operational-law-handbook_2020.pdf), "The “Rendulic Rule:”  The Rendulic case also stands for a broader standard regarding liability for battlefield acts: commanders and personnel should be evaluated based on information reasonably available at the time of decision...There may be situations where, because of incomplete intelligence or the failure of the enemy to abide by the LOAC, civilian casualties occur.  Example:  The Iraqi Al Firdos C3 Bunker.  During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), U.S. military planners identified this Baghdad bunker as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters.  The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths.  Was there a violation of the LOAC?  Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces.  Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective.  Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made."

- In 2015, it was alleged by Senate Democrats that the CIA spied on their staffers during the SSCI's study of the RDI program. This report was been discredited independently (see [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1377197-ssci-minorityviews.html) and [here](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1377196/cia-response-to-senate-report.pdf)). This allegation at first appeared to be supported by an independent CIA IG investigation—however, the IG investigation was refuted by a secondary [review](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1502797/redacted-12-2014-agency-accountability-board.pdf) by an Accountability Review Board, to which DOJ agreed. There was no spying. It was CIA's servers (known as RDInet), on a CIA facility, accessing CIA records, to which the Senate Staffers were aware CIA was able to access the other side to make sure no documents were present that shouldn't have been there. This was routine.

- In 2014, Congress created a new authority for the Department of Defense (DOD) to train and equip select Syrians in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, Section 1209 of P.L. 113-291, as amended). This authority, as amended by subsequent legislation, enables DOD “to provide assistance, including training, equipment, supplies, stipends, construction of training and associated facilities, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals.” Such assistance activities are authorized for select purposes, including supporting U.S. efforts to combat the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria and promoting the conditions for a negotiated settlement to Syria’s civil war. <sup>[1](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33487.pdf)</sup></sup> These groups are vetted to make sure they're in compliance with international law regarding use of force, detention operations, etc. Per the [Leahy law](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PP410_INVEST_v2.1.pdf), the US Government is prohibited from using funds for assistance to units of foreign security forces where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights (GVHR). The training is not limited to military activity, but mandatorily includes promoting and educating the respect for the rule of law and human rights. An independent [audit](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Aug/22/2002174036/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2015-175.PDF) conducted by the DoD's internal watchdog, confirms that the vetting procedures designed to identify derogatory information that would keep an individual from participating in the Syrian Training and Equipment program meet and satisfied the criteria established under the 2015 NDAA. It also provided some recommendations to further strengthen the effort.


- On February 2012, in Afghanistan, 100 Qurans and other religious material were burned in an incinerator. Pundits claimed this was evidence of US not caring for the culture and religious material in Afghanistan as elsewhere. However, an [independent investigation](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIALibrary/cases/00-0002/064.%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pdf) found this wasn't the reason:
   >On the night of 20 February 2012. up to 100 Qur'ans and other religious materials were burned in an incinerator at BAF. The events leading up to the incident involved a search of the library books in the library at the Detention Facility at In Parwan (DFIP). Because of suspicions that detainees were using library books to pass notes and messages, members of the 535th  Military Police (MP) Battalion (BN) and the Theatre Intelligence Group (TIG) Counter-Intelligence (CI) Team at  the DFIP planned a search of the books in the library. During the search, one of the interpreters helping to interpret the notes and messages written in the books reported that approximately 60-75 percent of the books in the library also contained extremist content. A junior leader perceived that he had permission from his commander to remove the objectionable materials from the library, and the library search team began to separate texts for removal. A work detail loaded the books into a supply truck as part of the nightly burn pit run. During the loading process an Afghan National Army (ANA) Soldier and an ANA interpreter expressed concern about removing the books to US Service Members loading the books. Because the US  Service Members thought that the books were contraband, they disregarded the ANA and interpreter's cautions. The ANA Soldier and interpreter then  voiced their concerns to DFIP Operations, but by the time that Battle Captains in DFIP Operations figured out what was happening. the truck was already on its way to the burn pit. Many books were burned before a local national at the burn pit noticed that some of the books were Qur'ans. 

  >Overall Findings. In the course of events on 20 February. I find  that US  Service Members mishandled Qur'ans and other religious material, to include their disposal at an incinerator. I do not find  that those involved acted with any malicious intent to disrespect the Quran or defame the faith of Islam, however. Ultimately, this tragic incident resulted from a lack of cross-talk between leaders and commands, a lack of senior leader involvement in giving clear guidance in a complex operation, junior and mid-grade leaders choosing the easy way instead of the right way to address a problem. distrust among our US Service Members and our partners. ignorance by US Service Members with respect to the importance and handling of the Quran as well as other religious material. and poor adherence by US  Service Members to established procedures. Clearly a decisive point in the events that took place that day was the segregation of religious books based on the advice of primarily one linguist who characterized the books as "radical" or 'extremist' in nature. over-reliance on one linguist's interpretation of book content improperly influenced a series of tactical decisions, resulting in a strategic crisis. Nonetheless, US Service Members made the decision to segregate, remove, and bum the books and own the responsibility for their destruction. That US  Service Members did not heed the  warnings of their ANA partners is, perhaps. my biggest concern. Despite all the missteps, at no time was the path chosen by the involved US Service Members motivated by hatred or intolerance of a particular faith."

OUP was conducted with full compliance under International law.<sup>[1](https://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2012_05/20120514_120514-nato_1st_icil_response.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://usnwc.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=13617148)</sup></sup> Seveal academic studies have concluded that OUP complies with International law in targeting operations, "Target planners and aircrews devoted enormous effort to avoid CIVCAS, and generally succeeded in their considerable efforts to avoid civilian casualties."<sup>[3](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR676/RAND_RR676.pdf.)</sup></sup> "In targeting enemy forces, NATO forces strictly adhered to their obligations under the law of armed conflict. Targets were positively identified prior to prosecution and all feasible precautions were taken in order to minimize damage to civilian property and the civilian population."<sup>[4](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/yearbook-of-international-humanitarian-law/article/abs/operation-unified-protector-and-the-protection-of-civilians-in-libya/D5358B142D9F7EDA0F4014B6ED70529C)</sup></sup> Another paper refutes several myths surrounding OUP, one of the most important is that the operation was enacted to take Gaddafi out.<sup>[5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2016.1204322)</sup></sup>
Gaddafi loved assassinations to kill off dissidents, journalists, human rights activists and even attempts on heads of state and soon-to-be-rulers of Kingdoms. Thanks to the NSA, with new authorities granted under the Patriot Act, and other traditional SIGINT and hard work, and made public thanks to Snowden—we can see just one such assassination plot was [thwarted](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4389688-The-Saudi-Assassination-Plot-How-It-Was-Thwarted.html). What was the crime? A perceived insult. "This wealth of information tied the plot directly to Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qhadafi."

- In 2011, President Obama authorised the [lawful, Constitutional](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/pages/attachments/2015/04/02/2010-07-16_-_olc_aaga_barron_-_al-aulaqi.pdf) strike on a [senior al-Qa'ida member](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/107-3._panetta_declaration_6.10.2015_0.pdf), Anwar al-awlaki was the Chief of external operations. He was responsible for the planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the US and allied nations. He was most infamous for his pivotal role in AQAP's attempt to blow up a US airliner, bound for Detroit on December 25, 2009. The Government's [preference was to capture him](https://fas.org/irp/eprint/doj-lethal.pdf), but it was not feasible—and was deemed continuing to be an imminent threat.
His son was killed in this strike, but was not made the target. In January 2017, Trump approved a Special Forces raid in Yemen. Media alleged that among the [4-12 civilians killed](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf) (not 30 as media/NGOs claim), was Anwar's 8 year old daughter. However, declassified documents from ACLU litigation have confirmed no children were killed. [Women were among the combatants](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400-Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.html#document/p1).


- On November 25, 2010 media alleged, that, according to local sources: US Navy SEALs and Special Forces killed 6 civilians in Shah Wali Khot, having them tied back to back then burned them alive. The allegation was independently [investigated](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIA_RR_Files/5%20USC%20552(a)(2)(D)Records/Shah%20Wali%20Kot%20Afghanistan%20Investigation%202010/Shah%20Wali%20Kot,%20Afghanistan%20Investigation%202010.pdf), and found to be a Taliban hoax. The District governor also confirmed this—and his testimony was independently verified by HUMINT reporting, as well as by other Village elders.

- In 2010, Chelsea Manning leaked what became known as the 'Iraq war logs', however, it's worth noting that the vast majority of these leaks are in plain-text format. So while the [damaged caused was great](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3933088-Department-of-Defense-Final-Report-of-the.html)—the actual things that matter, to the concerned activity/member of public is the CIVCAS numbers. Sadly, no one is able to independently verify and confirm the plain-text files are accurate. Even worse, some stories don't even cite to the plain-text files on wikileaks site. 

- 12 February 2010 in Gardez District, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, news reports had claimed US Special Forces deliberately killed a pregnant woman, and covering it up. An independent investigation was ordered to answer two principle questions:
  - 1) Did the ground force deliberately mislead its higher headquarters in initial reports regarding this incident? 
  - 2) Did the ground force attempt to hide the circumstances surrounding the casualties by altering, tampering with, and/or cleaning up the incident scene? 
 
  The investigation [concludes](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2849845-Gardez-FOIA.html) that the answer to both of these questions is "No" and recommends no disciplinary action against the assault force members. The facts gathered in this investigation indicate that ground forces were unaware that the females were killed when they engaged Mohad Zahir after he emerged from a building in the compound with an AK-47 pointed at the assault force on the roof.

- In 4 May 2009, Bala Balouk District, Farah Province, Afghanistan—The Special Operations Marines (MARSOC) & Afghan SF units called in CAS with (4) F/A-18F strikes. Another (3) strikes were called in for a B-1B Bomber. Civilian casualties resulted because of the complex environment: "The use of military force in this engagement with the Taliban was an appropriate means to destroy that enemy threat within the requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  However, the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimize accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties. Throughout the conduct of this operation, the Ground Force Commander' s (GFC) ability to break contact was hampered by the effects of direct fire contact with a significant enemy force, a  lengthy effort to medically evacuate (MEDEVAC) U.S. and Afghan critically injured personnel by helicopter, and persistent, real-time intelligence on the enemy's continuing efforts to manoeuvre, mass, re-arm, and re-attack friendly forces from within the village. The independent [investigation](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=35748) concluded that the Laws of Armed Conflict were followed. At least 26 civilians were killed. Around 78 Taliban were killed.


- On 22 August, 2008, US Close Air Support killed 33 civilians in Azizabad, Afghanistan. US MARSOC and Afghan Special Forces executed a kill/capture of a High Value Target. After successful infiltration, the Afghan/US team received hostile force engagement. They requested CAS. Unknown to both US & Afghan forces, the hostile engagement positions were in close proximity to civilians. Allegations that the US/Afghan forces committed violations of the Rules of Engagement or Law of War during the 21-22 August 2008 firefight resulting in 90 civilian deaths are [unsubstantiated](https://archive.org/details/Azizabad-august-2008-MARSOC/mode/2up). The first investigation concluded there was 6 civilians killed. Subsequent to new information provided by UNAMA, ICRC, etc, the US conducted another, more comprehensive investigation. It found that there were 33 CIVCAS and 22 anti-coalition  militants died. The independent investigation 28 interviews resulting in more than 20 hours of recorded testimony from Afghan government officials, Afghan village elders, officials from IGOs/NGOs, US and Afghan service members, 236 documents and 11 videos. It also found villager statements heavily inconsistent, and other severe methodological flaws by the NGOs and UNAMA. The second investigation also incorporated FBI forensic teams to aid its efforts.

- Between 2004 and 2007, only [568 civilians](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIA_RR_Files/5%20USC%20552(a)(2)(D)Records/Incidents%20Reports%20or%20Actual%20Civilian%20Deaths%20in%20Iraq/r_TAB%20C%20EOF%20Incidents%20SIGACTS%2005%20Bracketed.pdf) were killed or injured as a result of US forces in Iraq.

- [4 March, 2007](https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/galvin-pentagon-report-1549974003.pdf), Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, a MSOC-F (a unit of MARSOC, Marine Special Operations Command), "convoy was subject to a complex ambush. Small arms fire, and a Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device approached the convoy at a high rate of speed and detonated. The convoy defended against additional near-simultaneous attacks, quickly regrouped, and resumed movement west on Highway A1 using authorised procedures to disperse the crowds and unblock the road to allowing the convoy to continue its westward route. Within 30 minute of the blast, and the convoy's return to base, internet media reports began surfacing indicating that a coalition convoy had opened fir on civilians, killing and wounding many. An Air Force Colonel was appointed to conduct an investigation into the facts surrounding the incident. The Colonel ignored statements by those in the  convoy, ignored EOD specialists, and placed too much at face value on alleged witness testimony.
Another investigation was appointed, a formal Court of Inquiry (COI) to independently determine the facts and circumstances relative to the actions of MSOC-F. After hundreds of interviews, a complete examination of the documentary evidence, the COI found the statements and testimony of the personnel in the MSOC-F convoy to be consistent, truthful, and credible. The COI found that MSOC-F Marines defended appropriately and proportionately against the 4 March 2007 enemy ambush, and that a non-governmental organization employee's unbiased testimony independently corroborated the testimony of the MSOC-F personnel. The COI opined that the findings and conclusions found in Col P's investigation run counter to the weight of the evidence considered by the Court. Additionally, Col P never interviewed the Reconnaissance Operations Center (ROC) Watch Officer on duty, nor did he review the ROC log to determine the sequence of events on 4 March to determine exactly what was reported and to whom it was reported. Based on his conclusion that the use of force applied by the personnel in the convoy was excessive, Col P recommended various personnel in the MSOC-F convoy be charged. Col P's investigation was discredited and the magnitude of his errors cannot be overstated. Col P was in possession of overwhelmingly clear evidence that MSOC-F was ambushed and responded in a discriminate and effective manner. Col P. suppressed exculpating evidence and inexplicably accepted the testimony of Afghans he stopped, apparently randomly, and questioned, making no effort to ascertain the location of the Afghans on 4 Mach 2007 and making no effort to corroborate their statements. Col P did not examine key locations, did not interview any of the Afghans allegedly injured by the Marines, and did not examine the ammunition logs."

- On September 16, 2007, members of Blackwater who were protecting a VIP were rushed into evacuating the VIP after a bomb went off outside the venue they were at. Spooked, the security detail rushed out of the area. Coming to a square, in the high-tensions of what had happened, accidentally engaged several civilians. The real issue comes after this occurred. The team tried to cover themselves by replacing parts of the vehicle with one already damaged, to bolster their mistake to the FBI. [They were found out](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/24/opinions/blackwater-defendants-pardon-trump-opinion-oconnor/index.html). Arrested, charged and convicted.


- On August 19, 2007, an article from the Washington Post claimed soldiers committed LOAC violations in what is dubbed as "The Battle of Donkey Island".
 The allegation claimed the US Soldiers shot and killed injured insurgents. The independent [investigation](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIALibrary/cases/00-0001/r_14%20OCT%2007%20VIOL%20OF%20LAWS%20OF%20ARMED%20CONFLICT.pdf) finds the article, while compelling, suffers numerous inaccuracies, that, while don't appear to be intentional by the author, was due to incomplete, contradictory information, and general confusion. Separately, the investigation finds it likely that noncombatants were killed. But could not determine by who.

- On July 12, 2007, a US Apache helicopter was providing force protection to Bravo Company 2-16. The Company had been in near continuous contact from insurgents since dawn. The Apache spotted a group of armed men heading in the direction of Bravo Company. The Apache kept its eye on the group until one person peaked around a corner, knelt, and shouldered what appeared to be an RPG. Indeed, the leaked footage from wikileaks confirms this. After the Apache cleared the building, it was cleared to engage the insurgents. After the dust settled: Unknown to the Apache crew, all but two people turned out to be insurgents—they were two journalists with Reuters. It must be highlighted that these two journalists were not wearing the standard 'press' or 'media' vests, nor did they tell the military they'd be present in an area that had seen fighting for days on end. Among the bodies, there were RPGs, AKMs, and other weapons. There was [no violation of the Laws of War, Rules of Engagement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1506533-30-2nd-brigade-combat-team-15-6-investigation-pdf.html), etc.
The leaker of the footage, and many other records that [put innocent civilians at risk](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3933088-Department-of-Defense-Final-Report-of-the.html) was charged and convicted for a [number of crimes](https://web.archive.org/web/20190304152646/https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/Apps/ACCAOpinions/ACCAOpinions.nsf/ODD/818BA3ADDACC08A28525829E0060B9B1/$FILE/oc-manning,%20be.pdf)

- On March 15, 2006, between 3-9 civilians were killed in a raid on a building that was later destroyed. According to an [independent investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/world/africa/04iht-raid.1880380.html), "Allegations that the troops executed a family living in this safe house, and then hid the alleged crimes by directing an airstrike, are absolutely false, the raid's ground commander had adhered to the rules of engagement."
 
- On November 19, 2005, in Haditha, Iraq: a patrol from Company K, 3d Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), mounted in High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles(HMMWVs), was struck by an IED and received some small arms fire near the intersection of Routes Chestnut and Viper in Haditha, Iraq. The patrol suffered one FKIA and two FWIA as a result of the IED attack. During actions taken by the patrol in response to the attack, at least 24 Iraqi civilians were killed near the IED site.
Following standard procedures of condolence payments sent to family of victims, reporting came in containing allegations of deliberate and wrongful killings by the Marines. On 14 February 2006, the MNC-1 Commander directed Colonel G.A. Watt to conduct an AR 15-6 investigation into the incident. The investigation concluded that there had been no intentional targeting of noncombatants; that overall, throughout the entire engagement, Marines had attempted to distinguish combatants from noncombatants; that the force used was proportional, and that the Marines provided adequate medical care to non-coalition force casualties. His investigation concluded that the insurgents had violated the LOAC essentially by using homes occupied by noncombatants to attack the Marines. Colonel Watt, however, did conclude that Marines had failed to comply with the ROE in that they had failed to positively identify (PID) targets as legitimate before engaging, resulting in the death of noncombatants. As a result, Colonel Watt recommended further investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) or NCIS.
NCIS investigated this matter and found some evidence that two individuals talked to each other about fabricating their accounts of the incident. However, a new, authoritative, final review known as the [Chiarelli report](https://www.mcmilitarylaw.com/documents/000_mg_bargewell_15-6__haditha_report_.bates.pdf) was established and found, even with the additional evidence provided by NCIS, " as noted, NCIS did uncover evidence that certain squad members coordinated false stories on specific aspects of the incident; however, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the overall deficiencies in reporting and follow-on action—while sometimes perplexing—were not the result of an extensive and orchestrated criminal cover-up throughout the chain of command."

  An Investigating Officer [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/specials/iraq/documents/SharrattReport070607.pdf), examined all evidence presented at an Article 32 hearing, and independently concluded Marines acted in accordance with ROEs, specifically LCpl Sharratt.

  #### Interrogations
   Due to considerable public confusion (thanks in large part to media/NGO pundits) on GWOT's detention activities, it's prudent to concisely clarify that there are 3 areas distinct from one another: 
   1) Abu Ghraib and Bagram: Had rare cases of unauthorised detainee abuse, only some of these led to death and GBH, all responsible were investigated, charged and convicted. This is where the famous photos come from.
   2) GTMO: had seen approved of techniques that closely followed FM 34-52. such as faked identity of interrogator, deception such as forged documents, and yelling, (though not in the ear). No enhanced techniques from CIA. GTMO's cases of unauthorised activities were a handful of cases, such as moving some detainees between their cells to disrupt sleep or duct-taped a detainee's mouth shut to stop him from yelling and inciting a riot. Other alleged cases that were approved, a female interrogator rubbed her perfume on a detainee. The most severe was a one-time case of a dog being brought into an interrogation booth.
   3) CIA blacksites: In Afghanistan, had several approved enhanced techniques that had undergone legal scrutiny from DOJ, WH and CIA. These techniques were designed to fall below the threshold of torture under US and International law.
    
  Neither GTMO or the blacksites saw cases of the disgusting acts that were themselves, rare, at Abu and Bagram. The following entries below cover these 3 areas.

- In 2004, allegations of unauthorised detainee abuse poured in from the media, concerning Abu Ghraib. These are not to be confused with the [lawful](https://www.aclu.org/files/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc164.pdf)[*](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/torturefoia/released/082409/olc/2007%20OLC%20opinion%20on%20Interrogation%20Techniques.pdf), [effective](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1377197-ssci-minorityviews.html) means of gaining actionable intelligence by the CIA's [Enhanced Interrogation Techniques](https://archive.org/details/RDI-Brief). By [mid-2004, 155 investigations](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/d20040824finalreport.pdf) into detainee abuse allegations had been completed, resulting in 66 substantiated cases.

- Unauthorised detainee abuse was uncovered by a number of independent investigations, some already listed here, at Abu Ghraib and Bagram. It should be noted: That this was rare, done by a "small group of morally corrupt soldiers and civilians". Accountability was swift when thoroughly investigated.<sup>[1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nationi/documents/fay_report_8-25-04.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/d20040824finalreport.pdf)</sup></sup> As noted in a comprehensive examination of detainee handling even as early as [July 2004](https://archive.org/details/detainee-operations-inspection), there was no systemic abuse, or causes of abuse. The vast majority were in compliance with DoD standards for humane treatment and care. 

- On September 23, 2009, an [independent](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Oct/31/2001836211/-1/-1/1/09-INTEL-13.PDF) investigation found that allegations that the DoD, between September 2001 to April 2008 was using "mind-altering drugs" on detainees to be unsubstantiated. Some detainees were medicated to treat diagnosed mental conditions.

- On November 8, 2009, an [investigation](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/FormicaReportRelease.pdf) of US Special Forces at Abu Ghraib found that a number allegations of detainee abuse were unsubstantiated and contradicted by the evidence. In general, facilities met the standards under international law as well as US law and policy. It did discover some issues, and made recommendations for mandatory corrective training.

- On June 9, 2005, an [investigation](https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/report/2005/d20050714report.pdf) into FBI allegations of detainee abuse concluded. After reviewing a _three-year_ period covering more than _24,000 interrogations_, Furlow and Schmidt identified _three_ interrogation acts that were never approved for use by the government. The investigation revealed no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at Guantanamo Bay. Interrogations were assessed, separately, to fall within bounds of US and International law, even those not approved, or were approved and never implemented.

- A 2005 Navy Inspector General report, also known as the [Church report](https://ia601501.us.archive.org/18/items/Full-church-report/ChurchReport.pdf) concluded, "we examined the 187 DoD investigations of alleged detainee abuse that had been closed as of September 30, 2004. Of these investigations, 71 (or 38%) had resulted in a finding of substantiated detainee abuse, including six cases involving detainee deaths. 8 of the 71 cases occurred at GTMO, all of which were relatively minor in their physical nature. Additionally, 130 cases remained open, with investigations ongoing. Finally, our investigation indicated that commanders are making vigorous efforts to investigate every allegation of abuse—regardless of whether the allegations are made by DoD personnel, civilian contractors, detainees, the ICRC, the local populace, or any other source." One case was removed from this statistical report leaving it to just 70 substantiated. Of the 70, there were only 121 victims. Disciplinary action was taken against a total of 115 personnel. The investigation found no link between approved interrogation techniques and detainee abuse." The report also finds, "An early focus of our investigation was to determine whether DoD had promulgated interrogation policies or guidance that directed, sanctioned or encouraged the abuse of detainees. We found that this was not the case. While no universally accepted definition of "torture" or "abuse" exists, the theme that runs throughout the Geneva Conventions, international law and US military doctrine is that detainees must be treated "humanely." Moreover, the President, in his February 7, 2002 memorandum that determined that al Qaeda and the Taliban are not entitled to EPW protections under the Geneva Convention, reiterated the standard of "humane" treatment. We found, without exception,  that the DoD officials and senior military commanders responsible for the formulation of interrogation policy evidenced the intent to treat detainees humanely, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion that such officials or commanders ever  accepted that detainee abuse would be permissible. Even in the absence of precise definition of "humane" treatment, it is clear that none of the pictured abuse at Abu Ghraib bear any resemblance to approved policies at any level, in any theater. We note, therefore, that our conclusion is consistent with the Independent Panel, which in its August 2004 report determined that "no approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuse that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."

  This report also notes that after interrogations under FM 34-52 failed, Major General Michael Dunlavey requested a number of counter-resistant [techniques](https://web.archive.org/web/20090714112912/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=7487) not within FM 34-52. These were broken down into [3 categories](https://web.archive.org/web/20090724080341/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jun2004/d20040622doc3.pdf). After extensive legal review, Cat 1 and 2 were approved. Only one Cat 3 was approved: Mild, non-injurious physical contact such as grabbing, poking in the chest with a finger, and light pushing. However, not even this was put into practice. Cat 2 approvals were rescinded before they could be used. Upon further legal review by an independent panel, only techniques that closely followed FM 34-52 were approved. Waterboarding didn't make it through the panel's review early on.<sup>[1](https://ia601408.us.archive.org/24/items/ChurchGTMO/d20050310exe.pdf#page=4)</sup></sup>

- In November, 2004, in Fallujah, Iraq, TF 2-2 provided indirect fire support to US forces during the battle for Fallujah. During the battle, TF 2-2 lawfully deployed White Phosphorus munitions, described as "shake and bake", to flush out insurgents out of trench lines and spider holes, because of its Psychological impact. To quote from the March 2005 magazine [Field Artillery](https://sill-www.army.mil/fires-bulletin-archive/archives/2005/MAR_APR_2005/MAR_APR_2005_FULL_EDITION.pdf), 'The Fight for Fallujah', "WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE. We fired “shake and bake” missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out." This entry was misquoted by media to allege that US forces were deploying WP munitions against combatants for its incendiary and/or chemical effects. 

- On May 12, 2004, CIA Deputy Director McLaughlin, in closed [testimony](https://archive.org/details/may-12-2004-ddcia-testimony) corrected the record to Congress that CIA was not involved in any of the photos seen that leaked to the media, of unauthorised detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. He said, "We are not authorised in the program to do anything like what you have seen in those photographs." As noted by the Office of Medical Services (OMS) on the RDI program during their [review](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5301943/CIA-OMS-Summary.pdf), "The empirical record affirmed effectiveness and, through the presence of OMS, the safety of the program. Finally, critically and urgency  each received case-by-case analysis from CTC. Though imperfect this review nonetheless limited the application of EITs to less than a third of the detainees who came into Agency hands, and further limited the use of the most aggressive techniques to only 5 or 6 of the highest value detainees. A criterion  of"'necessity" also requires that no aggressive measure be used when a lesser measure would suffice."

- In May 2004, US conducted a raid near the Iraq-Syrian border, targeting several HVTs of the Zarqawi network. The NYT and AP alleged this was a wedding where many civilians were killed as a result of the raid. However, Signals, Human and Satellite intelligence as well as forensic and contradictory and inconsistent local testimony during interviews proved this allegation [false](https://www3.centcom.mil/FOIA_RR_Files/5%20USC%20552(a)(2)(D)Records/U.S.%20Raid%20Near%20the%20Syrian-Iraq%20Border%20on%2019%20May%2004/r_Responsive_Docs-Facts_Findings-new-Bracketed.pdf).

- In 2003, the US detained Ammar al-Baluchi, an AQ operative, whose interrogation sessions provided key details on senior AQ members, disrupting plots, etc.<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1377197/ssci-minorityviews.pdf)</sup></sup> When Ammar was transfered to GTMO, he alleged a number of various abuses against him, however, an independent IG investigation that resulted from those allegations, concluded:
  - That he was not hit in the head with a bar or pipe.
  - That he was not given a vaccination that made him crazy.
  - That he was not hit on hise nose, causing it to bleed.
  - That he was not kept in a freezing cell.
  - That he was not threatened sexually.
  
   The review notes that all blacksites providing a high quality care: Providing Halal meals, personal video games, books, movies, and religious items, etc. Each cell contained an in-room personal shower, gym, Koran and was climate-controlled (heater/aircon). The facilities were sterile, clean—efficient, modern–invoking a surreal feeling. During routine, monthly doctor checkups, Baluchi had two teeth fillings. In 2004, due to his fasting, fainted in his cell, causing a head injury—about half an inch long to the back side of the head.<sup>[2](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21416908/exhibit-c-baluchi.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On December 10, 2002, a number of US Military personnel (20) were involved in [detainee abuse](https://archive.org/details/doddoacid-011770) that resulted in the death of two men, one of whom was Dilawar. CIA had no involvement in this matter. All men were convicted.

- On 30 June, [2002](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207215250/http://www.centcom.mil/News/Reports/Investigation_Oruzgan_Province.htm), in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan, recon and other coalition aircraft came under fire from a number of compounds by AAA batteries. An AC-130 was called in. There were people within this area of Oruzgan Province that regularly aimed and fired of variety of weapons at coalition aircraft. These weapons represented a real threat to coalition forces. As OFT commenced, AAA weapons were fired and, as a result, an AC-130 aircraft, acting properly and in accordance with the rules, engaged the locations of those weapons. Great care was taken to strike only those sites that were actively firing that night. While the coalition regrets the loss of innocent lives, the responsibility for that loss rests with those that knowingly directed hostile fire at coalition forces. The operators of those weapons elected to place them in civilian communities and elected to fire them at coalition forces at a time when they knew there were a significant number of civilians present. 


- On November 2002, Gul Rahman died in CIA detention. An independent [investigation](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006555318.pdf) found that he was not subject to torture or mistreated—that his own actions lead to his death. It reached the following conclusions:
  - >There is no evidence to suggest that Rahman's death was deliberate.
  - >There is no evidence to suggest Rahman was beaten, tortured, poisoned, strangled, or smothered.
  - >Gul Rahman's actions contributed to his own death. By throwing his last meal he was unable to provide his body with a source of fuel to keep warm. Additionally, his violent behavior resulted in his restraint which prevented him from generating body heat by moving around and brought him in direct contact with the concrete floor leading to the loss of body heat through conduction.
   
   This was also subject to an OIG investigation, and forwarded to DOJ for prosecutorial determination. DOJ notified it would not charge, but would include it in an ongoing special counsel review by the Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. An independent [study](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1377196/cia-response-to-senate-report.pdf) of the RDI program found that in addition to OIG investigations and criminal prosecutions—including the extensive multi-year investigation of RDI activity by a DOJ special prosecutor, which reviewed more than 100 detainee cases—CIA convened six accountability proceedings, either at the directorate or higher level, from 2003 to 2012.
 In total, these reviewed assessed the performance of 30 individuals (staff officers and contractors), and 16 were deemed accountable and sanctioned. OIG conducted two seperate major reviews and at least 29 seperate investigations of alleged misconduct. Some of these reviews were self-initiated by Agency components responsible for managing the program. CIA made numerous referrals to the OIG relating to the conduct of Agency officers and their treatment of detainees, during the life of the program as well as after. When actions appeared to violate criminal prohibitions, referrals were made to the DOJ.
 
  In total, OIG conducted nearly 60 investigations on RDI-related matters. In over 50, OIG found the allegations to be unsubstantiated or otherwise did not make findings calling for accountability review. Of the remaining cases, one resulted in a felony conviction, one resulted in termination of a contractor, and revocation of his security clearances, and six led to accountability reviews.
   
- It has been alleged by several media outlets and NGOs that the CIA had several of the following individuals in CIA custody:
  - Khalid Al-Zawahiri
  - Osama Bin Yousaf
  - Qari Saifullah Akhtar
  - Walid bin Azmi
  - Iban Al Yaquti al Sheikh al-Sufiyan
  - Amir Hussein Abdullah al-Misri
  - Safwan al-Hasham
  - Jawad al Bashar
  - Saif Al-Islam Al-Masri
 
  A [review](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20392756-savage-nyt-foia-redacted-durham-report-to-holder-on-cia-detainees-not-in-cia-custody) of FBI, CIA and DoD documents confirms none of these individuals were in CIA custody.
  
- Around January 2004, the CIA detained Khalid' Abd al-Razzaq al-Masri, a German citizen. This, however was an error. Not a case of mistaken identity, but a lack of intelligence to justify holding him. It was believed he was a known HVI, who goes by the alias, Khalid al-Masri. However, by mid March it was determined he should be released. The German Government was notified and he was sent back clandestinely, in May 2004. Post-release, he levied a number of accusations against the CIA. That he was sodomized, beaten, injected with drugs, and forced fed. These claims were investigated, among other things such as how he was wrongfully detained by an independent Inspector General review, which [finds](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4454539/Document-21-CIA-Office-of-the-Inspector-General.pdf):
  >OIG's investigation found no credible information that al-Masri was subjected to physical abuse of any kind while in CIA custody. Evidence gathered during the investigation suggests that the experience that gave rise to al-Masri's allegation he was sodomized was, in fact, a routine rectal examination conducted by a physician's assistance during his initial medical examination. He ended his hunger strike when faced with the possibility of being force-fed. In keeping with standard practice for flight safety, al-Masri was restrained with flex cuffs, his eyes were covered, and he had noise suppression muffs over his ears. In consideration of CTC/RDG's request, however, al-Masri was not forced to wear a diaper (a sanitary measure for flight risks), and he was permitted to use the toilet and drink water. Al-Masri also did not wear the usual sweat clothes but wore civilian clothing specifically for him by CTC/RDG officers.

- In 2003, the US legally invaded Iraq pursuant to UNSC Resolution 1441. This was preceded by years of Iraqi non-compliance with prior resolutions + a ceasefire agreement. The popular myth is that the US and UK Governments lied to justify invasion. However, a review of the declassified record shows this claim to be a hoax:
 [Response to the independent report of the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-intelligence-and-security-committee-report-on-iraqi-weapons-of-mass-destruction) concerning Iraq WMDs and in examining  whether  the  available intelligence,  which  informed  the  decision  to  invade  Iraq,  was  adequate  and  properly assessed and whether it was accurately reflected in Government publications. 
The Committee found the following key conclusions:
  -  The September dossier was endorsed by the whole JIC (ISC Report, paragraph 106).
  -  The  September  dossier  was  founded  on  the  intelligence  assessments  then available (paragraph 107). 
  -  The September dossier was not ’sexed up’ by Alastair Campbell or anyone else (paragraph 108). 
  -  The  JIC  was  not  subjected  to  political  pressures.  Its  independence  and impartiality were not compromised in any way (paragraph 108)
 
  A Senate Intelligence Committee study, titled, _[Whether public statements regarding Iraq by US Govt Officials were substantiated by Intelligence information](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/110345.pdf)_ found that all public statements by US officials were indeed supported by the intelligence at the time, see page 117 of PDF/133 of scan.

  Another [study](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf) by the same committee found that no intelligence was fabricated, or skewed or that analysts were pressured to making an assessment.
   >"The Committee was not presented with  any evidence that intelligence  analysts changed their judgments  as a result of political pressure, altered  or produced  intelligence products to conform  with Administration  policy, or that  anyone even attempted to coerce, influence  or pressure  analysts to do so.  When asked whether  analysts were pressured  in any way to alter their assessments  or make their judgments  conform  with Administration policies, not a single analyst answered yes."

  It has been alleged in the media and by pundits, that then SecDef Rumsfeld created a "rouge intel op" to justify invading Iraq, and created false intel reports, etc. This conspiracy theory was debunked by a [2007](https://archive.org/details/IraqPreWarActivitiesResponse/mode/2up) DODIG report, and management comments. 
  
  It's worthy to note CIA's own retrospective series also concludes that Iraq's own actions, even when seemingly trying to become transparent, made them look suspicious. And of course, their often less than forthcoming on other areas raised concerns with many foreign intelligence services, not just the US and UN.<sup>[1](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=721802)</sup></sup>
 
- Under the September 17, 2001 Memorandum of Notification, the CIA engaged in a covert program to hunt down, capture, detain, and later interrogate HVT AQ detainees. This program exampled effective oversight improvements over time, indeed, [Congressional staffers](https://ia802305.us.archive.org/18/items/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program.pdf#page=14) notes that one CIA Black Site, "upon departing... compared the facility to both the US Military detention facility at Bagram and the facility at Guantanamo Bay. Both remarked that the facility "was markedly cleaner, healthier, more humane and better administered facility."
An independent [audit](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4454538/Document-20-CIA-Office-of-the-Inspector-General.pdf) of CIA facilities notes, "Detainees at facilities operated by CTC/RDG are provided essentials of shelter, clothing, nourishment, and hygiene; medical and psychological examinations and treatment; limited [[but high quality]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20887990-00000000-cia-hvd-program) dental and vision care; opportunities for physical exercise and intellectual, religious, and recreational pursuits; and daily contact with facility staff. Detainees are held in solitary confinement in climate-controlled, lighted, aboveground, windowless cells that are equipped with a mattress, a sink, and a toilet. None of the detainees showed any apparent physical signs of mistreatment."

  Even within CTC, any detainees reporting to be mistreated and use of unauthorised techniques were thoroughly, independently investigated. Indeed, CTC/Legal [forwarded](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120073426/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/0006541723.pdf) Mr. Hawsawi's complaints to the OIG. They, in turn, forwarded it to the DOJ, as the allegations as alleged, if true—would be in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. 2340A Torture. All investigations found no evidence to support the allegations, however, still updated the DOJ on the matter in 2006. This, among others, shows the Agency is not afraid to self-report allegations even by detainees for investigation. It was also falsely claimed by Dianna Feinstein that the CIA spied on her Committee when conducting their review of the program. This was thoroughly debunked by an independent [review](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1502797/redacted-12-2014-agency-accountability-board.pdf). It has also been falsely claimed that the CIA did "forced feeding" via the anal route as a humiliating, unauthorised technique. However, an independent [review](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1377196/cia-response-to-senate-report.pdf) found, "Medical personnel who administered rectal rehydration did not do so as an interrogation technique or as a means to degrade a detainee but, instead, utilized the well-acknowledged medical technique to address pressing health issues." It also highlights two main points:
  - > The technique was deemed safer than using IV needles with noncompliant detainees and was considered more efficient than a naso-gastric tube.
   
  - > With respect to Majid Khan, in contrast to the Study's account, our records indicate Khan removed his naso-gastric tube, which posed the risk of injury and other complications. Given this dangerous behavior, rectal rehydration was considered the most appropriate means of addressing the potential harm Khan might inflict  on himself."

- Claims that the United States invaded Afghanistan to control the poppy fields and protect the market have proven time and time again to be false, ignoring the US-led effort to destroy, disrupt and phase out poppy cultivation in the land, working with the Afghanistan Government and ISAF to reach this goal. This goal has had its ups and downs, and did work overall. While poppy production increased over the years; it stemmed from Taliban/AQ-controlled regions—not those controlled by the Government.<sup>[1](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/inl/rls/other/102214.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/90671.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/counternarcotics/index.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20171213_RL30588_0a51c51635f5c5fcd227fe6dc9d4dda135ef1aa4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://media.defense.gov/2007/Jul/01/2001712995/-1/-1/1/Counternarcotics_Pgr_Afghan%20_Final%20Rpt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/testimonies/witnesses/attachments/2016/02/02/01-15-14_dea_capra_testimony_re_future_us_counternarcotics_efforts_in_afghanistan_web_ready.pdf)</sup></sup>

- After the terrorist attack on 9/11, the US responded by sending in [small CIA/Special Forces teams](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf) into Afghanistan. They knew their enemy. "In CTC/SO, we operated on the understanding that the enemy was not Afghanistan, not the Afghan people, and not even the Taliban as a government institution. The enemy was al-Qaida, particularly the terrorists' command and control network and their specific Taliban leadership allies."
US later invaded Afghanistan. [Legal under US domestic & international law](https://archive.org/details/warinafghanistan85schm)
The US invaded Iraq because of its [non-compliance with UNSC Resolution 1441](https://archive.org/details/wariniraqlegalan86pedr)

- The First Gulf War, led by the US to repel the illegal invasion & occupation of the Iraqi military from Kuwait was both devastatingly effective, and in [full compliance with international law](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=638&skin=2021), as emphasis was placed on [reducing civilian casualties and collateral damage to infrastructure as much as possible](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=664&skin=2021) this includes the "highway of death". As the final report to Congress notes:
  >"In the early hours of 27 February, CENTCOM received a report that a concentration of vehicles was forming in Kuwait City. It was surmised that Iraqi forces were preparing to depart under the cover of darkness. CINCCENT was concerned about the redeployment of Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, fearing they could join with and provide reinforcements for Republican Guard units west of Kuwait City in an effort to stop the Coalition advance or otherwise endanger Coalition forces. The concentration of Iraqi military personnel and vehicles, including tanks, invited attack. CINCCENT decided against attack of the Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, since it could lead to substantial collateral damage to Kuwaiti civilian property and could cause surviving Iraqi units to decide to mount a defense from Kuwait City rather than depart. Iraqi units remaining in Kuwait City would cause the Coalition to engage in military operations in urban terrain, a form of fighting that is costly to attacker, defender, innocent civilians, and civilian objects.The decision was made to permit Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait City and engage them in the unpopulated area to the north. In the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm, some questions were raised regarding this attack, apparently on the supposition that the Iraqi force was retreating. The attack was entirely consistent with military doctrine and the law of war. The law of war permits the attack of enemy combatants and enemy equipment at any time, wherever located, whether advancing, retreating, or standing still. Retreat does not prevent further attack. At the small-unit level, for example, once an objective has been seized and the position consolidated, an attacking force is trained to fire upon the retreating enemy to discourage or prevent a counterattack." 
 
   It has also been alleged by conspiracy theorists that the US secretly gave the "greenlight" for Saddam to invade. This is a hoax. An examination of the record indicates the exact opposite: "we have found nothing in the captured Iraqi documents or recordings indicating that Saddam or his principal advisers perceived a “green light” to invade Kuwait. In fact, the captured documents point in the opposite direction. In the period preceding the invasion, Iraqi officials regularly stated that invading Kuwait would entail a military confrontation with the United States. In 1989, the GMID assessed that Schwarzkopf’s recent visit to Kuwait revealed that 'America has pledged to defend the Gulf States, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to protect them from any aggression they might encounter.' In July 1990, the same agency concluded that, in the event of an Iraqi invasion, Kuwait would receive military support from the United States and potentially from other countries as well. Saddam apparently agreed with this assessment. In a conversation with his advisers shortly after the invasion, he claimed that before invading Kuwait, the Iraqi leadership had taken into account that the United States might retaliate with “a complete boycott” and 'strike us in the air, land, and sea—everywhere.' Saddam did not expect forbearance from a country he considered an aggressive imperial power; he expected conflict."<sup>[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7709.2012.01045.x)</sup></sup>

- During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), [U.S. military](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=649&skin=2021&q1=Al%20Firdus%20bunker) planners identified Al Firdos C3 Bunker (Amiriyah shelter),  as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters.  The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths.  Was there a violation of the LOAC?  Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces.  Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective. Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made. A review of the targeting policies at the time were determined to be proper. 

- January 1991, it was alleged that USS Nicholas engaged Iraqis on oil platforms who were showing white flags to surrender. This was the case for only a handful of Iraqi personnel who were next to others brandishing weapons at recon helicopters, who were also armed with Surface-to-air missiles and AA Guns. The following day, when the helicopters returned, no white flags were seen, and the demonstrated hostile intent was clear. The USS Nicholas engaged under strict Rules of Engagement and applicable international law.<sup>[1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44642452.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35a8f6a42d0569530172e517dcbd6724)</sup></sup>

- In 1991, the United States and allied countries [under UNSCR resolution & strict Rules of Engagement](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1459&context=ils), imposed 3 no-fly zone operations to secure the Kurdish people from slaughter at the hands of the brutal Iraqi regime. This measure allowed the Allied nations to also provide humanitarian aid. 

- In August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s army invaded Kuwait and consequently the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq.
Saddam lied about the effect of these sanctions, by manipulating census data. A [paper](https://gh.bmj.com/content/2/2/e000311) published in BMJ Global Health confirms, "Since 2003, however, several more surveys dealing with child mortality have been undertaken. Their results show no sign of a huge and enduring rise in the under-5 death rate starting in 1991. It is therefore clear that Saddam Hussein’s government successfully manipulated the 1999 survey in order to convey a very false impression—something that is surely deserving of greater recognition."

- In 1988, a US Navy ship accidentally shot down civilian airline flight 655. An [independent investigation](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6660400-1988-Iran-Plane-Crash-Fp.html#document/p1) determined that Iran was at fault for the tragedy. Its actions that day led to the incident. "On the morning of 3 July, MONTGOMERY observed seven IRGC small boats approaching a Pakistani vessel. The number shortly thereafter grew to 13 and they began to challenge nearby merchantmen. VINCENNES was ordered to the area to support MONTGOMERY and launched a helicopter to reconnoiter the scene. In the progress the helicopter was fired upon. VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY closed the general areas of the small boats. Two of the boats turned toward  VINCENNES  and MONTGOMERY while the others began to manoeuvre erratically. These actions were interpreted as manifesting hostile intent and both ships, after being given permission, engaged. This action, involving high speed course changes and gunfire at close range, was still in progress when Air Bus 655 took off from the joint military/civilian airfield at Bandar Abbas and headed toward Dubai. It is hard to overemphasize the fact that Bandar Abbas is also a military airfield. The Air Bus was probable not informed of the surface action taking place in the Strait. Informed or not, Flight 655 logically appeared to have a direct relationship to the ongoing surface engagement.

  During the critical seven minutes that Flight 655 was airborne, Captain Rogers and his CIC Watch team were integrating a multitude of ongoing events. Specifically, VINCENNES was engaged in a high-speed surface battle with at least two groups of Iranian small boasts—all of which had the capability to inflict serious damage. At the same time, she was monitoring one of her helos which was airborne and had already come under attack.  CIC was also tracking an Iranian P-3 military aircraft airborne approximately 60 nautical miles to the northwest which was presenting a classic  targeting profile. (i.e., furnishing information to an attack aircraft.) In the midst of this highly charged environment, an unknown aircraft took off from a joint military/civilian airport on a flight path headed directly toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. This was the same airfield from which Iran had launched F-4s in support of an attack on US naval forces on 18 April. This unknown aircraft was 27 minutes behind any scheduled commercial airline departure from Bandar Abbas airport. Although it was flying within a known commercial air corridor, it was off centerline some 3 or 4 miles, which was not the usual centerline profile for commercial air traffic previously monitored by VINCENNES. Moreover, its mid-range altitude was consistent with either a hostile or commerical aircraft. VINCENNES could detect no radar emanations from the contact which might identify it, but was reading a Mode III IFF squawk. This situation was confused somewhat when a Mode II IFF squawk was detected and the aircraft was identified as an F-14. Complicating the picture was an Iranian P-3 to the west which was in excellent position to furnish targeting information to an attacking aircraft. More importantly, the unknown contact continued at a gradually increasing speed on a course headed toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. It failed to respond to repeated challenges from VINCENNES over both military and international emergency distress frequencies.
  
- It has been alleged, that through "Operation Cyclone", the US funded/trained terrorist groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, under the umbrella of the Mujahidin—thus also, creating Bin Laden—to combat the illegal Soviet invasion and occupation on Afghanistan. 
This is a distortion of reality, and is often misunderstood.
While it is true the CIA did aid the Mujahidin, they did so only to moderate factions, under strict vetting for human rights compliance & religious views. These moderates, would be known as the Northern Alliance after the Soviet invasion ended. They fought against AQ and Taliban extremists in the 90s, with US assistance. 
Ultimately, the US reached out again to the Northern Alliance after the events of 9/11, to go after the terrorist groups.

  CIA had 0 contact or relationship of Bin Laden during the 80s. Indeed, it is the Soviet's illegal invasion of Afghanistan that created Bin Laden. He used his wealth to fund and supply the Afghan Arabs in the Mujahidin.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/static/c40e6e16c1183e0bed3777f048f41d98/Devotion-to-Duty.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20191101205458/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/cia-the-war-on-terrorism/terrorism-faqs.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.cia.gov/static/9fa9520134e1c2f3068001de69c9964b/Curator-Pocket-History-CIA.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
- In May 1985, a Washington Post article alleged CIA had an indirect role of a car bombing incident in Lebanon in March of that same year. 
 CIA reviewed the matter after examining all files and personnel, and concluded no such connection or foreknowledge existed. This was independently verified by a House Intel Committee investigation. 
   - "The Committee's review has uncovered no evidence that any US Intelligence Agency — any US Government Agency — has encouraged or participated in any terrorist activity in Lebanon. Further, the Committee was able to discover no evidence that any US Intelligence agency had foreknowledge of the March 8 bombing outside the residence of Sheik Hussein Fadlallah.
   - Its review of relevant documents and files and its interview of appropriate government officials leads to the conclusion that no US Government complicity, direct or indirect, can be established with respect to the March 8 bombing in Beirut."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91-00587R000100720055-4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000807590013-2.pdf)</sup></sup>

  
- In 1980s, US had no involvement in the Turkish coup. According to the list's own wiki citation, the alleged source for the claim clarified in a June 2003 interview, "I did not say to Carter "Our boys did it." It is totally a tale, a myth, It is something Birand fabricated. He knows it, too. I talked to him about it." And, "General Kenan Evren said 'the US did not have pre-knowledge of the coup but we informed them of the coup 2 hours in advance due to our soldiers coinciding with the American community JUSMAT that is in Ankara.'" 

- Despite many allegations, no evidence exists that the US supported either or both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict.
It is [confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20170124020754/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90T01298R000300670001-8.pdf) that the USSR was a major supplier for chemical agents and other gear to Iraq. CIA only, naturally, [monitored](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81B00401R000500030002-5.pdf) the conflict—it is after all—the _Central Intelligence Agency_. On the Iran-Contra story, the US replaced Israel's 500 TOW missiles they sent to Iran, in exchange for Iran to pressure Hezbollah to release US hostages. The US maintained its arms embargo on Iran throughout the conflict, in its stance of neutrality. Reagan repeatedly asked for assurances that this wouldn't upset the balance between Iran and Iraq.<sup>[1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014946043&view=2up&seq=39&skin=2021)</sup></sup>


- In 1953, the CIA spearheaded an operation to aid the Shah, who legally dismissed Mossadeq. Pundits and historical revisionists claim Mossadegh was "democratically elected" this is furthest from the truth. Indeed, he was widely seen as unpopular, and the "election" is widely considered a sham. As noted in the most comprehensive & authoritative [study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4375470-Document-2-Zendebad-Shah.html) of the CIA's involvement, the author concludes,
"Did the CIA act against a legitimate leader enjoying popular support? Although there is no doubt that Mossadeq captured the imagination of segments of Iranian society with the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, his political support dwindled steadily. By August 1953 he did not command mass support. The Tudeh and splinters of the National Front were the only political parties willing to support him. The pro-Shah sentiments of the Tehran crowds on 19 August 1953 were genuine. Although CIA had a hand in starting the demonstrations, they swelled spontaneously and took on a life of their own that surprised even Kermit Roosevelt. By August 1953, Mossadeq's support was vociferous by increasingly narrow. The Shah's support was latent but deep, and took a crisis—like the news of Tudeh demonstrators pulling down the Shah's statutes—to awaken. Khorramabad residents, for example, wildly rejoiced at hearing of the monarch's return. Before dismissing reports like those from  Khorramabad as propaganda, it must be remembered that CIA was able to influence directly events only in the capital city, and there only barely. Kermit Roosevelt had neither the money nor the agents to initiate the kinds of demonstrations that took place in Iran's widely separated cities.

  Did CIA restore the Shah to his throne? TPAJAX did not "restore" the Shah to his throne either technically or constitutionally. Although the Iranian monarch left Tehran during the operation, he never abdicated. Mossadeq's argument that the Shah's _firmans_ were invalid was disingenuous. The Iranian constitution gave the Shah the right to dismiss the Prime Minister. As soon as Mossadeq refused to obey the Shah's legal order, he was rebelling against constitutional authority. From that point on, TPAJAX became an operation to remove the usurper Mossadeq and permit Zahedi, the legitimate Prime Minister, to take office. Unlike Mossadeq's government, Zahedi's government recognized the Shah's constitutional authority."
  
- In 1949, the US had no involvement in the Syrian coup. The lists own' [wiki citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1949_Syrian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#Political_context_and_allegations_of_U.S._involvement) makes it clear it's just a mere allegation, with contradictory narratives from the same author of several books. Nothing in the documentary record exists to even suggest a possible connection.

- In 2004, at the [request](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/29990.htm) of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, the United States facilitated his safe departure, after resigning.

- In Peru, between 1995 and 2001, the CIA worked with the Peruvian Government in a counternarcotics operation. In 2001, the Peruvian Air Force accidentally shot down a US plane carrying missionaries. Shortly after the incident, Director Hayden tasked the CIA's Inspector General reviewed the matter: Finding a lapse in procedures and charged that some CIA officers involved attempted to cover it up. This was disputed by a another seperate, independent [Agency Accountability Board](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/cia-statement-2001-peru-shootdown/story?id=9738624) review, that examined both the IG's report as well as conducting its own investigation. 16 officers were administratively punished after the Board's report was sent to Director Panetta. DOJ concurred with this finding, declining to criminally charge anyone involved. The fault lied mostly with the Peruvian Air Force in failing to adhere to the procedures as they had done so in the past.

- Haiti, September 1994, US Military forces were ordered to execute [Operation Uphold Democracy](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/kretchikw.pdf). The objective was to return to office the democratically elected President, and to facilitate a stable and secure environment in which democratic institutions could take hold. This was successful. President Aristide reassumed his duties, the Junta that ousted him was forced to leave the country, and national elections were successfully held in 1996. The democratic process there was given the opportunity to succeed due, in large part, to Operation Uphold Democracy. 

- In June 1996, the President's Intelligence Oversight Board issued its _[Report on the Guatemala review](https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214324/http://www.ciponline.org/iob.htm)_ which examined CIA's interaction with security services on human rights issues concluded:
 "The human rights records of the Guatemalan security services—the D-2 and the Department of Presidential Security (known informally as "Archivos." after one of its predecessor organizations)—were generally known to have been reprehensible by all who were familiar with Guatemala. US policy-makers knew of both CIA's liaison with them and the service's unsavoury reputations. The CIA endeavoured to improve this behavior of the Guatemalan services through frequent and close contact and by stressing the importance of human rights—insisting, for example, that Guatemalan military intelligence training include human rights instruction. The station officers assigned to Guatemala and the CIA headquarters officials whom we interviewed believe that the CIA's contact with the Guatemalan services helped improve attitudes towards human rights.
 
   DO Guidance on Human Rights:
   The CIA's Directorate of Operations (DO) and Guatemala station were clearly aware of the potential for human rights violations by assets and liaison contacts. In November 1988, the DO's Latin America (LA) division provided a guidance cable to its Central American stations:
   >"Point we would like to make is that we must all become sensitized to the importance of respecting human rights, and we must ensure that those assets and resource we direct and/or fund are equally sensitive. The issue will only become more important, and we serve our objectives best if we remember that if we ignore the importance of the human rights issue in the final analysis we do a great damage to our mission. We are under great scrutiny.
   >Finally, aside from the legal and policy considerations which are constant in any allegations concerning violations of human rights we also recognize a basic moral obligation. We are Americans and we must reflect American values in the conduct of our business. We are all inherently opposed to the violation of human rights. Those who work with us in one capacity or another must also respect these values."
   
    The IOB also notes:
   >"US policy objectives in Guatemala from 1984 to the present--the period we reviewed--included supporting the transition to and strengthening of civilian democratic government, furthering human rights and the rule of law, supporting economic growth, combating illegal narcotics trafficking, combating the communist insurgency, and advancing the current peace process between the government and the guerrillas."
   >"The CIA's successes in Guatemala in conjunction with other US agencies, particularly in uncovering and working to counter coups and in reducing the narcotics flow, were at times dramatic and very much in the national interests of both the United States and Guatemala.
   
    The CIA's Independent Inspector General issued a multi-volume series on Guatemala. [Volume 1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000690161.pdf) concludes similar.
  
  The Department of Defense also issued its 1995 [report](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Sep/11/2001806396/-1/-1/1/REPORT%20TO%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE%20ON%20DOD%20ACTIVITIES%20IN%20GUATEMALA%20(U).PDF), 'Guatemala Review - Report to the Secretary of Defense on DoD Activities in Guatemala. which found that US Policy towards Guatemala was:
  >Promoting a stable democratic government to include ending the Marxist insurgency;
  >eliminating human rights abuses;
  >responding to the economic and social needs of the Guatemalan people; and
  >reducing drugs and drug trafficking.

  Based on the documentation reviewed, all significant DoD programs and activities in Guatemala from 1980 to 1995 were within the stated US Policy objectives:
  >There were 1,366 deployments to Guatemala during the period. Involving at least 25,021 DoD personnel. US military personnel performed humanitarian and civic action exercises designed to demonstrate the role of the military in stabilizing a democratic government and improving the economic and social welfare of the Guatemalan people.
  >Since 1990, DoD personnel have supported the Drug Enforcement Administration's effort to interdict narcotics trafficking in Guatemala by transporting law enforcement personnel, detecting suspected trafficking activity, providing intelligence support and assisting in planning counterdrug operations.
  >The DoD security assistance program during the period totalled 28 million in grant aid and 3.384 million in International Military Education and Training. With the exception of one UH-1 helicopter in 1983, no major end items were provided to the Government of Guatemala.

- The CIA had no involvement drug trafficking, as alleged by Gary Webb. Several independent investigations could not substantiate the claims and found contradictory information to said allegations, such as when CIA learned of such illegal activities, they tipped off local Law Enforcement to take action. 

  The independent investigations include: CIA's Inspector General; DOJ's Inspector General; Joint Committee on Contra; the Select Committee on Narc abuse; Crime subcommittee; Foreign Relations Committee; FBI; Special Counsel and lastly the 2000 House Intel Committee, which reviewed all prior investigations, and conducted its own, finding: "Based on its investigation, involving numerous interviews, reviews of extensive documentation, and a thorough and critical reading of other investigative reports, the Committee has concluded that the evidence does not support the implications of the San Jose Mercury News—that the CIA was responsible for the crack epidemic in Los Angeles or anywhere else in the United States to further the cause of the Contra war in Central America."

  From the Joint Committee, "Our investigation has not developed any corroboration of media-exploited allegations that U.S. government-condoned drug trafficking by Contra leaders or Contra organizations or that Contra leaders or organizations did in fact take part in such activity. During the course of our investigation, we examined files of State, DoD, NSC, CIA, DEA, Justice, Customs and FBI, especially those reportedly involving newspaper allegations of Contra drug trafficking... During the course of our investigation, the role of U.S. government officials who supported the Contras' and the private resupply effort, as well as the role of private individuals in resupply, were exhaustively examined. Hundreds of persons, including U.S. government employees, Contra leaders, representatives of foreign governments, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials, military personnel, private pilots and crews involved in actual operations were questioned and their files and records examined. Despite numerous newspaper accounts to the contrary, no evidence was developed indicating that Contra leadership or Contra organizations were actually involved in drug trafficking. Sources of news stories indicating to the contrary were of doubtful veracity. There was no information developed indicating any U.S. government agency or organization condoned drug trafficking by the Contras or anyone else.

  We have discovered that almost all of these allegations originate from persons indicted or convicted of drug smuggling. Justice has stated that such persons are more and more claiming, as a defense, that they were smuggling for the benefit of the Contras in what they believed was a U.S. government sponsored operation. Typically, they furnish no information which can be corroborated by investigation. In addition to the above-mentioned negative file reviews, interviews with employees of these U.S. agencies have also been negative. Contra leaders have been interviewed and their bank records examined. They denied any connection with or knowledge of drug trafficking. Examination of Contra financial records, private enterprise business records and income tax returns of several individuals failed to locate any indication of drug trafficking."
An investigator involved in this examination, a retired FBI Special Agent, reiterates this point and says that "the [Certified Public Accountants] who were charged with auditing the Contra bank accounts found no evidence of influxes of cash attributed to drugs" He says the bank accounts examined included the Contra organization's bank accounts in the Bank of Commerce and Credit International, and personal bank accounts. According to the investigator, the sources of all the money in these accounts were accounted for and much came from third country contributors.<sup>[1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112071984519&view=2up&seq=1&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://ia904603.us.archive.org/14/items/reportofcongress87unit/reportofcongress87unit.pdf#page=655)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://archive.org/details/WatersCIAContraReportExcerpt/_Waters_CIAContraReportExcerpt/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/9712/exec.htm)</sup></sup> 

  - It has been alleged since the 80s, and still persists to this day thanks to movies like 'American Made', that CIA used Mena airport, Arkansas, to do drug smuggling. This was also refuted by an independent [investigation](https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CIA-Mena-Report.pdf).

- In responding to requests from El Salvador, the US aided covertly and overtly, resistance movements to the [anti-democratic](https://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/documents/d-all-19.pdf) regime in Nicaragua. Nicaragua was engaging in a massive, illegal covert program—backed by the USSR, to overthrow the democratic government in El Salvador and surround countries. To expand on this further, I'll quote at length from the ICJ dissenting [opinion](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/70/070-19860627-JUD-01-09-EN.pdf) on the matter. It's worth noting the dissenting opinion is more than twice as long as the judgement, and revisits the factual and legal record before it. Applying far more care:
  "I am profoundly pained to say, I dissent from this judgement because i believe that, in effect, it adopts the false testimony of representatives of the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua on a matter which, in my view, is material to its disposition...
The facts are in fundamental controversy. I find the Court's statement of the facts to be inadequate, in that it is sufficiently sets out the facts which have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to the United States, while insufficiently sets out the facts which should have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to Nicaragua. 

  Without any pretence, still less actuality, of provocation, Nicaragua since 1979 has assisted and persisted in efforts to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by providing large-scale, significant and sustained assistance to the rebellion in El Salvador - a rebellion which, before the rendering of Nicaraguan assistance, was ill-organised, ill-equipped and ineffective. The delictual acts of the Nicaraguan Government have not been confined to provision of very large quantities of arms, munitions and supplies; Nicaragua (and Cuba) have joined with the Salvadoran rebels in the organisation, planning and training for their acts of insurgency; and Nicaragua has provided the Salvadoran insurgents with command-and-control facilities, bases, communications and sanctuary, which have enabled the leadership of the Salvadoran insurgency to operate from Nicaraguan territory. Under both customary and conventional international law, that scale of Nicaraguan subserve activity not only constitutes unlawful intervention in the affairs of El Salvador; it is cumulatively tantamount to an armed attack upon El Salvador."

  "Not only is El Salvador entitled to defend itself against this armed attack; it can, and has, called upon the United States to assist it in the exercise of collective self-defense. The United States is legally entitled to respond.  It can lawfully respond to Nicaragua's covert attempt to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by overt or covert pressures, military and other, upon the Government of Nicaragua, which are exerted either directly upon the Government, territory and people of Nicaragua by the United States, or indirectly through the actions of Nicaraguan rebels - the "contras" - supported by the United States."
  A [thorough investigation](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/2702452-Iran-Contra-Minority-Report) over the actual Iran/Contra should be a read for anyone interested in the case.
  As for the "guerilla manual" is largely overstated by pundits. After press reporting, [several investigations](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/statement-principal-deputy-press-secretary-speakes-central-intelligence-agency) followed: One by CIA's Independent Inspector General; one by the President's Intelligence Oversight Board and lastly a [Congressional investigation](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/5/items/united-states-congressional-serial-set/United_States_Congressional_Serial_Set.pdf). All concluded the purpose of the manual was to aid moderate guerilla's against a brutal regime, and how to win support of the people. However, due to poor translation by the contractor who made the report, was misinterpreted. 
  
- It was alleged that the CIA, in El Salvador, supported right-wing death squads, and encouraged security service abuses—during hostilities between Salvadoran security forces, right-wing groups and left-wing terrorists. This has been a [thoroughly debunked](https://archive.org/details/united-states-congressional-serial-set) USSR hoax, to cover the USSR's support for left-wing death squads and terrorists. <sup>[1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1279408/soviet-support-for-international-terrorism-and.pdf)</sup></sup> Indeed, 3 seperate, independent investigations concluded as much: The House Intel Committee (cited above and quoted below); the [Senate](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/98659.pdf) Intel Committee and the Inspector General. US pressure, public and private, saw success at moderating security services, the military, police, and overall civic affairs. During the free and fair election of Duarte, a number of reforms took place, most important was judicial.<sup>[2](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=530&skin=2021)</sup></sup>
 
   From the House Intel Committee, "The staff's investigation looked at press reports and materials from private organizations alleging a range of US intelligence activities with reference to death squads. These allegations can be summarized as follows:
  - That US intelligence trained, organized, financed and advised Salvadoran security forces that engaged in death squad activities;
  - That US intelligence was aware of torture and killing by Salvadoran security services and death squads, and in some cases participated in such killings.
  
   > The Committee staff conducted a comprehensive review aimed at providing as much information as could be gathered bearing on these allegations. It reviewed intelligence reporting on death squads as well as the intelligence tasking which established priorities for intelligence collection. The Staff examined all intelligence reporting bearing on death squads from 1979 to present. It reviewed State Department cables bearing on the same subject. The staff conducted interviews with numerous intelligence officials knowledgable about intelligence activities in El Salvador from 1979 to 1984. The staff also reviewed in detail a CIA Inspector General report requested by the Committee in connection with H. Res.467. This report reviewed CIA operational relationships that might have involved members of death squads. Finally, the staff made additional requests for information. The staff review of operational intelligence relationships leads it to conclude that US intelligence agencies have not conducted any of their activities in such a way as to directly encourage or support death squad activities. To the contrary, US intelligence activities have been directed, sometimes successfully, at countering death squad activity, reducing thee power of individuals connected with death squads, and seeking their removal from positions of authority.
  
  > The staff has uncovered no evidence that US intelligence officials or US intelligence policy in any way encouraged torture by Salvadoran security service or by any death squads. To the Contrary, all that the staff can discover indicates US intelligence efforts to moderate the behavior of Salvadoran security service and armed forces personnel to prevent such activities. Further, as the US has learned more about death squad activity, and as it has concentrated more policy attention on this subject, some improvements have taken place. The staff points in this regard to the exile from El Salvador of certain officials identified by the United States as having death Squad connections."
  
- On May 1989, General Noriega attempted to nullify Panama's democratic election, where Guillermo Endara had rightfully won. Following this, the US engaged in a prolonged effort to engage diplomatically via the OAS, to persuade Noriega to honor the election results. He did not. On the first of September, the same year, he illegally appointed a new provisional government, headed by his loyalists—after a coup failed, against this coup, he declared that Panama was in a state of war against the US. US soldiers and civilians were killed and wounded after this declaration of war, as well as unlawfully detained. On 20 December, 1989, Operation Just Cause was launched. The United States lawfully invaded the Republic of Panama to overthrow the unelected dictatorship of General Manuel Antonio Noriega. By capturing the general, defeating the military forces he commanded, and returning the country back to the rightful, democratically-elected government. There are many authoritative studies on Operation Just Cause, detailing its success, legality, context, and rebuilding efforts under civic and humanitarian activities.<sup>[1](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-91-174fs.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://history.army.mil/html/books/just_cause/CMH_55-1-1_Just_%20Cause_opt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Just_Cause.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Apr/05/2001727349/-1/-1/0/B_0061_SHULTZ_AFTERMATH_WAR.PDF)</sup></sup> 


- On October 1983, the United States [legally intervened](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/Military_Law_Review/pdf-files/277865%7E1.pdf) in Grenada, with international partners, with [Minimal civilian casualties](https://web.archive.org/web/20170129131916/http://insidethecoldwar.org/sites/default/files/documents/Grenada%20A%20Preliminary%20Report%20December%2016%2C%201983.pdf), "Grenadian casualties were 45 killed and 337 wounded. 24 of the Grenadian dead were civilians, 21 of whom were killed in an unfortunate bombing of a mental hospital located adjacent to an anti-aircraft installation. 24 Cubans were killed and 59 wounded of the approximately 800 Cuban 'construction workers' on the island... By December 15, all U.S. combat forces had withdrawn; among the U.S. forces only training, police, medical and support elements remained."

- In 1981, Soviet propaganda outlet TASS, alleged that the United States was behind the death of Panamarian President Omar Torrijos. This was [confirmed](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00049R001303150031-0.pdf) to be be Soviet disinformation.

- During the 1980s, allegations from the Baltimore Sun, reported in 1995, allegations of CIA's complicity in Honduran human rights abuses. This triggered then-DCI John M. Deutch to direct a review of the allegations, from the 1980s to 1995, the review, known as the Honduras Working Group concluded, "there is no information in CIA files indicating that CIA officers either authorized or were directly involved in human rights abuses." Some issues remained unresolved, and reported this to CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin. In July 1996, she requested the Inspector General investigate these outstanding matters. The IG report corroborated the Working Group's findings, "No evidence has been found to substantiate the allegation that any CIA employee was present during sessions of hostile interrogation or torture in Honduras." It also found no connection to the CIA in connection to, or evidence of the existence to ELACH, an alleged right-wing paramilitary organization; nor involved in any attempts to cover-up or downplay reporting. These two reviews independently corroborated a 1988 IG investigation that found no CIA aid or connection to any human rights abuses.. An OGC review also confirmed CIA had no involvement in, planned, or otherwise connected to Olancho Operation. CIA policy regarding interrogations, and human rights in general is best described in a January 14, 1985 HQ cable:
  >"...Intervewing and interrogation of suspect in custody is a method routinely used by police, security and intelligence services around the world. In many countries, legal and basic rights of the suspect in custody may not be given full consideration, resulting in deprivation of his/her human rights. CIA policy is not to participate directly in nor to encourage interrogation that results in the use of force, mental or physical torture, extremely demeaning indignities or exposure to inhumane treatment of any kind, as an aid to interrogation. CIA policy is to actively discourage the use of these methods during interrogations. CIA should play a positive role in influencing foreign liasion to respect human rights." Participation includes being in the room during an interrogation, sitting in an adjoining room monitoring the interrogation or providing questions while an interrogation is in progress. 

  A March 1976 HQ cable described CIA's Human Rights Policies and guidance,
  >"...employees must be especially sensitive to the political and possible legal ramifications of what the CIA does. This cable also included a description of CIA officer's responsibilities if it were to be discovered that a host or third country intelligence or security service was about to undertake actions that could reasonably be construed to be gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. CIA personnel  also were advised in this cable that, as a general rule, they should make appropriate efforts to prevent or delay such actions..."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000159944.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1963-1973, CIA was involved in Chile politics. Though, not as broad as people claim. CIA aided in propaganda to help elect Frei. Frei lost the following election. CIA thought to reach out to some in the military for resistance before Allende could have his power confirmed by Congress. This went nowhere. CIA had 0 involvement in the coup itself. CIA had no involvement in Pinochet's claim to power. [An overview of CIA's activities confirms the following](https://web.archive.org/web/20040409084054/http://www.foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp):
  - Many of Pinochet's officers were involved in systematic and widespread human rights abuses following Allende's ouster. Some of these  were contacts or agents of the CIA or US Military. the IC followed then-current guidance for reporting such abuses and admonished its Chilean agents against such behavior. Today's much stricter reporting standards were not in force and, if they were, we suspect many agents would have been dropped.
  - During a period between 1974 and 1977, CIA maintained contact with Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who later became notorious for his involvement in human rights abuses. The US Government policy community approved CIA's contacts with Contreras, given his position as chief of the primary intelligence orginization in Chile, as necessary to accomplish the CIA's mission, in spite of concerns that this relationship might lay the CIA open to charges of aiding internal political repression. From the start, the CIA made it clear to Contreras was that it would not support any of his activities or activities of his service which might be construde as "internal political repression." In its contacts with Contreras, the CIA urged him to adhere to a 17 January 1974 circular, issued by the Chilean Ministry of Defense, spelling out guidelines for handling prisoners in a manner consistent with the 1949 Geneva Convention.
 
  - In May and June 1975, elements within the CIA recommended establishing a paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his unique position and access to Pinochet. This proposal was overruled, citing the US Government policy on clandestine relations with the head of an intelligence service notorious for human rights abuses. However, given the miscommunications in the timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras.
A review of CIA's files has uncovered no evidence that CIA officers and employees were engaged in human rights abuses or in covering up any human rights abuses in Chile."

- The US Government also had no involvement in Operation Condor. The US also tried to [prevent & disrupt](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/5817664/National-Security-Archive-Doc-03-CIA-memorandum.pdf) the illegal activities and distance itself. The US asked Contreras to confirm its existence. [He did](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB416/docs/780822cia.pdf).

- In 1969-1970, it was stated by Soviet [propaganda](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/inss/Strategic-Perspectives-11.pdf), that Dan Mitrione (who was a U.S. Agency for International Development officer), was a CIA operative, and ran a torture campaign in Uruguay. Mitrione was kidnapped by the Tupamaros terrorists—who cited the Russian disinformation book as to how they learned he was a US Government employee, simply because his name appeared there, and that he had a role, as an alleged CIA operative, trained riot Police, they knew nothing about the unfounded accusations of torture. 

- In the 1970s, the United States took a large effort to promote Human Rights via humanitarian aid, military assistance, intelligence cooperation, international institutions, etc. Carter's administration set up NSC 28 to coordinate US Human Rights [policy](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91M00696R000100030020-1.pdf), assess [impacts](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01362A000200100001-6.pdf) and to detail [efforts](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/RESPONSE%20TO%20PD-30%5B15516322%5D.pdf) to promote Human Rights. In 1977, Human Rights reporting became a main focus on US Intelligence reporting requirements, with positive customer feedback in formulating US foreign policy.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83M00171R001200180001-5.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
- CIA had [no involvement](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf) in dictator, Rafael Trujillo's assassination. Some Latin American countries thought the US had allowed his brutal regime, however, it was just US policy to refrain from actions that would hasten his downfall. The US did encourage moderate democratic groups to resist the regime. The policy of non-intervention, while required by treaty, convinced Latin Americans that the US was supportive. 

- In Bolivia, 1971, CIA made a one-time payment to [discourage](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve10/d76a) a reportedly imminent coup and to “cement relations” with Bolivian military figures. Unknown to the CIA, a coup would follow two days later.

- US President Johnson took office in 1963, he inherited a longstanding U.S. Government policy of providing financial support for Bolivian political leaders. The policy was intended to promote stability in Bolivia by strengthening moderate forces, especially within the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) itself, which had a strong left wing under the leadership of Juan Lechin Oquendo, General Secretary of the Mine Workers’ Federation. In August 1963 the 5412 Special Group approved a covert subsidy to assist the MNR to prepare for the presidential elections scheduled for May 1964. The Special Group agreed in March 1964 that the MNR receive additional financial support. Paz won the election; Lechin (who had been Vice President under Paz) left the government and founded a rival leftist party. Covert action expenditures in Bolivia between fiscal year 1963 and fiscal year 1965 were as follows: FY 63—$337,063; FY 64—$545,342; and FY 65—$287,978. The figure for FY 65 included funds to influence the campesino movement, for propaganda, to support labor organizations, and to support youth and student groups. The FY 66 program also allocated funds to support moderate political groups and individuals backing General Barrientos for President.

  On November 4, 1964, the new Vice President, General René Barrientos Ortuño (MNR), led a successful military coup d’etat, forcing Paz into exile, (No US involvement in coup). In February 1965 the 303 Committee authorized a financial subsidy to the MNR under Barrientos (who was aware of U.S. financial support to the MNR) to help establish an organizational base for the presidential election scheduled for September. In May 1965 Barrientos responded to growing labor unrest by arresting and deporting Lechin and postponing the election. The 303 Committee, which considered a recommendation to support Barrientos as the best available candidate, agreed in July 1965 and March 1966 to authorize additional funds for MNR propaganda and political action in support of the ruling Junta’s plans to pacify the country and hold elections to establish a civilian, constitutional government.

  When the presidential election was finally held in July 1966, Barrientos won easily, and officials concerned with the covert operation concluded that the objectives of the program—the _end of military rule_ and a _civilian, constitutional government_ whose _policies would be compatible with those of the United States—had been accomplished._ <sup>[1](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d147)</sup></sup>
  
 - In 1962, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the DoD approved a draft plan, known as Operation [Northwoods](https://ia600908.us.archive.org/7/items/pdfy-vlGx2NTBHA-M19I3/Operation%20NORTHWOODS%20Document%20-%20Official%20Origin%20of%20Modern%20US%20False-Flag%20Attacks.pdf), which authorised:
   - Start rumours 
   - Land friendly Cubans in uniform "over the fence" to stage attack on base
   - Capture (friendly) saboteurs inside base
   - Start riots near base (friendly Cubans)
   - Blow up ammunition inside the base; start fired.
   - Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals for mock-victims.
    It goes on to say, "we could blow up a drone (unmanned) vessel anywhere in the Cuban waters."
     
    The media has incorrect claimed that the plans were intended to cause harm to civilians.
    
 - In 1958, the United States approached Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, to step down from power, both formally and with his long-standing friend in business, and for him to leave the Cuba scene for good, not support any elected person who'd merely be his puppet—in a bid to politically cease the hostilities between the "revolutionaries" who used terrorist tactics, against the Government and civilian populations. The US ceased its military aid to Batista, only supplying a limited number of radios. Prior to even 1958, the United States pressured, to some success, for the regime's military forces to respect human rights from a top-down level.<sup>[1](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v06/d189)</sup></sup>


- In 1954, the CIA had an involvement in the coup in Guatemala.
However, a number of myths persist as to why the US did what they did: That it was driven because of United Fruit lobbying (capitalism interests), and was against peasants. This narrative simply just doesn't fall in line with facts of reality:
  - The US was concerned of Soviet penetration, as a breach head to launch attacks and other operations by the KGB against the US, as it became increasingly overt and covert in its influence operations in Guatemala. 
  - The United States Department of Justice' antitrust Division wanted to break up the United Fruit monopoly. 
  - In 1951, the CIA had a number of successful programs to aid peasant farmers in a cooperative movement. It encouraged small, independent landowners.  It organised 15,000 peasants into 75 study groups, each of which formed a credit union to help its members buy land.
  - The US used United Fruit to apply pressure, once its use came to an end, State Department pressured and demanded the company grant higher wages, not just in Guatemala, but throughout the Western Hemisphere.  
  - Eisenhower's DOJ antitrust Division proceeded with its Court action, that it started in 1951, to which the company signed a consent decree, divesting it of its holdings in railroads and marketing operations. <sup>[1](https://ia601303.us.archive.org/6/items/CIA-Guatemala-Coup-Report/DOC_0000134974.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20180609064148/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000135796.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Africa
- On July 20, 2021, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia, conducted one airstrike in the vicinity of Galkayo, Somalia, against al-Shabaab fighters engaged in active combat against Somali Government forces. Initial assessment confirms [0 civilians killed](https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/33893/us-africa-command-conducts-strike-against-al-shabaab).


- In March 2019, Amnesty International issued a report about US Airstrikes in Somalia, alleging US ignores CIVCAS claims, commits war crimes, etc. 
Several [experts](https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2019/03/31/why-you-should-be-very-skeptical-of-amnesty-internationals-report/) have gone over the inferior methodology employed by NGOs like Amnesty on such matters. However, an [independent review](https://www.africom.mil/pressrelease/31697/u-s-africa-command-commander-directed-review-reveals-civilian-casualties) conducted confirms Amnesty got it wrong—again. This isn't the first time. The NGO, (and others have been shown to not even get the [month correct](https://archive.org/details/africomcivcas/mode/2up), when alleging a US airstrike.

- Since 2007, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), has done a number of assistance programs to African countries, ranging from [humanitarian aid, civil assistance](https://www.africom.mil/what-we-do), etc.
  Some of these are:
   - >Foreign Disaster Relief: Foreign Disaster Relief activities are unique Department of Defense capabilities (normally airlift or logistics) supporting USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) specific requests as approve by the U.S. Secretary of Defense. AFRICOM has responded to two disasters in the last decade (Ebola in West Africa in 2014, and Tropical Storm Idia in Mozambique in 2018), while BHA responds to dozens annually. The international community and BHA are normally able to respond to most disasters without DoD support. It is only the sudden onset catastrophic disasters overwhelming international community that require DoD support.
   - >Humanitarian and Civic Assistance: Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) activities are conducted in conjunction with authorized operations and exercises of the military services in a foreign country, with the approval of the partner nation national and local civilian authorities, and complement - not duplicate - other forms of humanitarian assistance provided to the partner nation by the Department of State and USAID. Funded by AFRICOM, these activities also serve the basic economic and social needs of the partner nation and promote the security and foreign policy interests of the U.S., the security interests of the country in which the activities are to be performed, and the specific operational readiness skills of the service members who participate in the HCA activities.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Disaster Preparedness Program: The Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP) increases the capacity of African nations to mitigate and prepare for an all-hazard disaster response within the ministry designated to respond. The program supports civilian-military interface, and enhancing collaboration and the military’s ability to perform their civil support functions. It also improves the capacity for regional interaction and stability in the event of a complex emergency such as a pandemic event. Working with national and regional entities in a comprehensive, holistic manner, the program builds capacity and capability over time. Funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), the DPP may provide training, planning support, technical assistance, exercise validation, and equipment purchases.
   - >Humanitarian Mine Action: The Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) program relieves human suffering and the adverse effects of land mines and other explosive remnants of war on noncombatants - including ammunition stockpiles - while advancing theater campaign plan strategies and U.S. national security objectives. The Department of Defense supports foreign governments in detection, clearance, physical security, and stockpile management of landmines and other explosive remnants of war by executing cadre development programs designed to develop capabilities for a wide range of HMA activities including education, training, and technical assistance.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Other: U.S. Africa Command’s Humanitarian Assistance - Other (HA-O) program includes activities designed to relieve or reduce endemic conditions such as human suffering, disease, hunger, and privation, particularly in regions where humanitarian needs may pose major challenges to stability, prosperity, and respect for universal human values. These program activities are funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), and address basic healthcare, education, and infrastructure needs. Common projects include construction of health clinics, schools, and provision of humanitarian supplies, and are intended to reduce the risk of, prepare for, mitigate the consequences of, or respond to humanitarian disasters.
   - >Pandemic Response Program: Since 2008 U.S. Africa Command has worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development to establish a Pandemic Response Program (PRP) aimed at assisting African militaries develop influenza pandemic response plans that are integrated into their country’s overall national response plans. Militaries can play key roles in the event of a pandemic, working in collaboration with other governmental, non-governmental and international organizations to maintain security, provide logistical support for food, medicine and other commodities, maintain communications, and provide augmented medical care. PRP strives to improve the capacity for regional stability in the event of a complex emergency by providing training and technical assistance, and identifies - and at times purchases - limited equipment needed for selected countries.
   - >Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP): The Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program is the DoD initiative in support of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that aims to support healthy and functional military forces to provide stability and safety to national and regional populations. Africa’s high rates of HIV/AIDS negatively impact African militaries and other uniformed organizations by reducing readiness, limiting peacekeeping deployments, and increasing risk to military and civilian personnel. DHAPP provides military-to-military program support by assisting in the development and implementation of culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment programs. AFRICOM provides oversight and strategic guidance so that DHAPP can develop and implement a culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment program. At over $100 million annually and operating in 38 countries, DHAPP is AFRICOM’s largest program on the Continent.
Current strategies and interventions employed by DHAPP include: Index case HIV testing (testing spouses, sexual partners, and all children of women who test HIV-positive); Documentation of every new HIV-positive individual and linking him or her into care and treatment; Periodically updating military HIV policies to address HIV testing strategies, chain of command notifications, deployments, stigma and discrimination, and antiretroviral treatment initiation and retention to reflect changes in international normative guidance; Antiretroviral treatment services thru mobile units; Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills building, and facilitated access to condoms; Promotion of voluntary medical male circumcision services which can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection in HIV-negative men by 60%; and stigma and discrimination prevention training.

- The US Department of Defense offers legal education to any nation who requests, through the [Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEpHRVqEgs4). A highly effective program that tailors to the specific host country. Members of the a foreign Military may visit the US, in Resident programs, or, the US may conduct workshops within the Country. These cover a [wide-variety](https://globalnetplatform.org/system/files/diils_2020_catalog_no_contacts.pdf) of legal issues: Human rights law, military justice, equal rights, etc. It has seen [major success](https://youtu.be/zEpHRVqEgs4?t=497), over a decade, DILLS worked with a number of African nations on justice reform, and methods to investigate and prosecute military personnel for sexual violent and gender-based crimes within the military. This sustained effort saw a sharp decline in sexual assault cases, an increase in successful investigations and prosecutions. These offer the ability to increase civilian oversight of the military, to either enhance, or develop their legal framework.

- Between 1992 and 1994, the United States Military worked with the United Nations in [humanitarian](https://history.army.mil/html/documents/somalia/SomaliaAAR.pdf) operations in Somalia, to combat famine during the civil war. This proved to initially be [successful](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Somalia.pdf) in its core mission, "The efforts of UNITAF could be rated a success in the sense that, when UNOSOM took over on 4 May 1993, Mogadishu was calm, heavy weapons had been stored in cantonments, and marauding gangs were suppressed. Food supplies were flowing, starvation practically had ceased, drought eased, and seeds and livestock were being replenished." 

- CIA had [no involvement](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf) in Prime Minster Patrice Lumumba's death in 1961.

## Europe
- Since FY2017, defense appropriations have prohibited funds from being used “to provide arms, training, or other assistance to the Azov Battalion”<sup>[1](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/R45008.pdf)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that Abu Omar subject to a CIA rendition in Italy in 2003. There has been 0 evidence to confirm the allegation. However, even if it were true, the rendition is perfectly legal under international law. Indeed, the Italian judicial system [violated international law](https://harvardnsj.org/2010/11/all-human-rights-are-equal-but-some-are-more-equal-than-others-the-extraordinary-rendition-of-a-terror-suspect-in-italy-the-nato-sofa-and-human-rights/), in respect to human rights.

- On May 7, 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, it was alleged that the US deliberately targeted the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. This was not the case. 
   In summary, there were several crucial errors which led to the Chinese Embassy being struck:
   
   > There was an error in locating the target. The approach used to attempt to locate the FDSP building was severely flawed.

   > All sources of information used to prevent precisely this type of accident were either inaccurate or incomplete.

   > The review process did not catch the locational error and did not consult any material or any person which could have provided correct information.

   > There was in the immediate aftermath of the bombing some confusion as to what had happened and some of our early public statements were confused and contradictory. To summarize clearly and precisely: the attack on the PRC Embassy was the result of a series of errors that led to the destruction of the PRC Embassy instead of the Serb military target that was intended. The use of a map containing an error--the inaccurate location of the Chinese Embassy--contributed to the tragic mistake--but this was not due solely to a "map error." What went wrong was, first and foremost, that the approach used to locate the Bulevar Umetnosti 2, the address of the FDSP, was severely flawed.

  > Second, the databases used to check and prevent this type of targeting error were also inaccurate, incomplete, and not fully independent.

  > And third, the target review process did not detect the first two mistakes, nor did it involve people and information that could have provided additional data to correct or detect these errors.<sup>[1](https://1997-2001.state.gov/policy_remarks/1999/990617_pickering_emb.html)</sup></sup>
  
   ICTY agreed with these findings, and found no war crime had occurred.

- In 1999, the United States-led NATO effort engaged in major [military operation](https://www.airforcemag.com/PDF/DocumentFile/Documents/2005/Kosovo_013100.pdf) for 78 days—to end the atrocities committed by the Serbian regime in Kosovo. The major goals were:
  - Ensuring the stability of Eastern Europe. Serb aggression in Kosovo directly threatened peace throughout the Balkans and thereby the stability of all of southern Europe. There was no natural boundary to this violence, which had already moved through Slovenia and Croatia to Bosnia.
  - Thwarting ethnic cleansing. The Belgrade regime's cruel repression in Kosovo, driving thousands from their homes, created a humanitarian crisis of staggering proportions. Milosevic's campaign, which he dubbed "Operation Horseshoe", would have led to even more homeless, starvation, and loss of life had his ruthlessness gone unchecked.
  - Ensuring NATO's credibility. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia signed agreements in October 1998 that were to be verified by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and monitored by NATO. in the period leading up to March 1999, Serbian forces increasingly and flagrantly violated these agreements. Had NATO not responded to Milosevic's defiance and his campaign of ethnic cleansing, its credibility would have have been called into question.
   
  The US/NATO campaign, Operation Allied Force—was in [full compliance with international law](https://archive.org/details/legalethicalless78wall/mode/2up).
   Indeed, the International Tribunal has ruled all aspects of the campaign were [lawful](https://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal#IVB4).<sup>[1](https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/casestudy/media/pap01_aar.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
- In 1995, during the Bosnian war, Operation Deny Flight transitioned to [Operation Deliberate Force](https://www.airforcemag.com/article/1097deliberate/), after  artillery shells killed 38 civilians and injured 85 others, by Serb forces. The air campaign resulted in few civilian casualties, and ended the civil conflict. Indeed, experts [have documented](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0074_OWEN_DELIBERATE_FORCE.pdf) the Operation's efforts to avoid civilian casualties and applaud its efforts and results, "constraints on force application  entailed  avoiding collateral effects and unintended consequences that would be counterproductive to the political peace process. This effort to avoid collateral and unintended damage extended not only to the surrounding  physical targets but also to concerns about fratricide, refugees, and noncombatant civilian casualties. The need for precision offensive air operations (OAS) platforms and weapons to limit  collateral damage while accomplishing mission objectives became  an overriding concern during the Balkans air campaign. Thus, precision-guided munitions (PGM) became the overwhelming weapons of choice during air  strike operations. Indeed, Deliberate Force became the first air campaign in history to employ more precision-guided bombs and missiles than unguided ones."

 
- On 9 October 1992, UN Security Council passed resolution 781, which prohibited unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone, but it did not take action against violators of the resolution. In response to over 500 documented violations, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures "to ensure compliance" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. NATO's [Operation Deny Flight](https://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/459001/operation-deny-flight/), which lasted from April 12, 1993 to Dec 20, 1995, enforced this UNSCR compliance.

- Between 1948-1956, Italy, the CIA aided centrists; socially/economically left-wing governments; labor unions; student groups and other socialist groups to provide political stability in preventing Soviet-backed right-wing authortarian groups to take hold—leading to a decade of democratic socialism. In total, only $3 million was provided to these various groups. A study finding, "The defeat of the Right meant that Communism's threat would be met through democratic politics, not a reversion to Fascism. The strength of the Socialists, even without aid from the outside, meant that left-wing sentiment looked toward a democratic form of socialism."<sup>[1](https://ia801601.us.archive.org/14/items/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-1956/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-56.pdf)</sup></sup>


- It has been alleged that the CIA and NATO, supported right-wing terror groups in Italy from the 50s to the 90s, under "Operation Gladio". This claim has been long-discredited by a large number of Cold war historians.<sup>[1](https://www.scribd.com/document/114855262/Misinformation-About-Gladio-Stay-Behind-Networks-Resurfaces)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676485)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://direct.mit.edu/jcws/article-abstract/16/4/35/13485/Stay-Behind-A-Clandestine-Cold-War-Phenomenon?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02684520500340357)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390500448524)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850600500332656)</sup></sup> <sup>[7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16161262.2005.10555113)</sup></sup> <sup>[8](https://www.cia.gov/static/9f3bcb469cee52fd1017f1c7c84aeadc/intel-officers-bookshelf-11.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- The list claims the CIA installed Georgios Papadopoulos in a Greece military coup in 1967. The list cited a wiki entry that contradicts the allegation, and confirms it was just that: An allegation. The wiki entry states, "during William Colby's confirmation hearing to be Director of Central Intelligence, Colby was asked by Stuart Symington, chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, if there was any justification for the assertions. Colby [replied](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074749253&view=2up&seq=7) that he had the allegations researched and found that the CIA had not engineered the coup, Papadopoulos was not an agent of the CIA, and that Papadopoulos was never paid by the CIA."

- It has been alleged that the CIA was involved in the Hungarian revolution against the brutal, authortarian Communist Stalinist regime; that the US signaled it would covertly, or overtly, help the democratic movement against the regime and USSR forces and that it had turned a blind-eye to the democratic revolution. However, a comprensive and authoritative declassified study reveals this isn't true. While the US was sympathtic to the Hungarian people, and pressing diplomacy at the UN, it was trying to avoid another world war: By disrupting the Soviet Union's atrocities agaisnt the movement, whilst also dealing with global matters that could have also sparked global conflict, such as the Suez crisis.<sup>[1](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/MDR_Releases/FY12/12-M-1691.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/3473778/Document-01-Almost-Successful-Recipe-The-United.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1956, the U2 spy plane flew into the Soviet Union. Fully [legal](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147637917.pdf) under [international law](https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=3108&context=jalc), the plane was seen as a success in its missions. Some have claimed, without evidence, it was used to support (unspecified) crimes. Nothing in its [history](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2014-004-doc01.pdf) details any criminal support. The Open Skies Treaty also [permits](https://www.osce.org/library/14127) such activities. 

- It was alleged that the CIA's predecessor, OSS—was involved in aiding Nazi war criminals to further US Scientific inquiry and Intelligence operations. This is a distortion of truth. It has been confirmed that there was no operation to rescue criminals from prosecution. As Allan Ryan, former Director of the Office of Special Investigation (the office to which Nazis were prosecuted) said,"From time to time in the past few years, books or other accounts have appeared claiming to expose some newly-discovered conspiracy by CIA, or the military, or a cabal of lawless bureaucrats, to bring Nazi collaborators to the United States after the war." "These accounts," according to Ryan, "have offered dubious evidence and have been unable to survive any objective analysis. 

  Indeed the opposite is true, these bodies worked hard to bring justice to these criminals. The CIA, (more than any), aided in bringing such justice in aiding the DOJ's OSI. In his role as director of the OSI, Ryan wrote, "no Federal agency, including the CIA, ever objected to any prosecution or tried to call off any investigation."<sup>[1](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20201018014445/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol40no5/pdf/v40i5a12p.pdf)</sup></sup>

- During and after WW2, US and allied forces investigated allegations against their own forces. Rape, murder, detainee abuse, etc. Against civilians and German soldier. These efforts resulted in thousands of US and allied service members being charged and convicted, some of whom sentenced to life in prison for violating international law. See:

- At the end of World War II, the US undertook, with allied forces, an unprecedented effort to remove the stain of Nazism from Germany, and rebuild the nation.
 This colossal effort has been well document, in particular on how the US provided care to local populations that were liberated, as well as after hostilities ended. Of note was their US' efforts to combat hunger, disease outbreaks, etc. As detailed in this authoritative, independent [Official History](https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/bookviewer?PID=nlm:nlmuid-9009947-bk#page/570/mode/2up) from the Medical Department, US Army.

- The Rheinwiesenlager (Rhine meadow camps) were a group of 19 US prison camps built in the Allied-occupied part of Germany to hold captured German soldiers at the close of the Second World War. The US and allied forces did their best to [maintain compliance with international law, and did](https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-1278003RX7-mvpart), with regards to detention operations of captive Germans. However, due to unforeseen issues such as the overwhelming numbers of German troop surrender, far more than planned—the Allied forces struggled to maintain sanitation conditions and other needs. They did improve overtime, but struggled. No Geneva violations occurred.

- In April 1945, the German [Concentration camp](https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/research/online-documents/holocaust/report-dachau.pdf) Dachau was liberated by US forces. The 45th Infantry Div executed 21 German POWs. 17 SS were segregated and shot. Another seperate incident involved two US soldiers killing 4 German guards. This was substantiated upon an independent [investigation](https://www.metrolibrary.org/archives/document/2020/02/45th-infantry-memorandum-inspector-general-seventh-army-regarding-dachau) by the Seventh Army's Inspector General which refuted the rational, justified and lawful explanation by Walsh.

- In the February 1945, the United States Air Forced lawfully bombed military targets in [Dresden](https://media.defense.gov/2011/Feb/08/2001329907/-1/-1/0/Bombings%20of%20Dresden.pdf). Numerous scholars have [detailed](https://www.raf.mod.uk/what-we-do/centre-for-air-and-space-power-studies/documents1/air-power-review-vol-13-no-3/) the legal regime during this period—ultimately concluding the Allied bombing campaign to be [lawful](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/3567438/Bennett.pdf).

- On Janurary 22, 1944, the United States set up the [War Refugee Board](https://archives.jdc.org/topic-guides/jdc-and-the-u-s-war-refugee-board-1944-45/) to coordinate a systematic, formal response to aid Jews from the Holocaust.

- In Sicily, 1943, at the Biscari airfield, Sergeant Horace T. West of the 180th  Infantry  Regiment, singlehandedly murdered 37 POWs. This was reported by LTC William E. King, the Division Chaplain. At this same location, though hours apart, CPT John T. Compton ordered a few of his men to kill a 36 POWs. Both cases were independently investigated and corroborated. Major General Troy H. Middleton convened a general court-martial for both men. West was found guilty, sentenced to life in prison. Compton's men didn't face Court-martial, since they acted under the orders of Compton, per Field Manual (FM) 27-10, Rules of Land Warfare, "Individuals of the armed forces will not be punished for these offenses in case they are committed under orders or sanction of their government or commanders. The commanders ordering the commission of such acts, or under whose authority they are committed by their troops, may be punished by the belligerent into whose hands they may fall." However, this also provided a defense in Compton's case—as, he claimed he was acting under the orders of General Patton. General Patton was cleared of wrong-doing by a seperate IG investigation. His speech didn't order killing of POWs, however it was misinterpreted as such. Since Compton thought he was acting on orders in good faith.<sup>[1](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/03-2013.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Asia
- It has been alleged the US Government aided Khmer Rouge, an organisation supported by China and other Communist states. The US engaged in a highly successful bombing campaign against the terror org. It has been [confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120133711/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90M00005R001000080038-7.pdf) US had no involvement in aiding the org:
  >1. Since the fall of 1986 we have received reports about a letter from a Congressional Staffer alleging USG support for the Khmer Rouge. The letter was written by Jonathan Winer, counsel to Senator Kerry, and contained what were purported to be figures on annual USG support for the Khmer rouge starting in 1980. Winer claimed in his letter that the information on USG support was received from the Congressional Research Service (CRS).
  
  > 2. The allegation an figures included in Winer's letter are completely without basis in fact. The USG abhors and condemns the Khmer rouge and has never provided  any direct assistance to them. We have, however, generously supported the relief  program for displaced Cambodians on the Thai border. We also assist the Cambodian noncommunist resistance forces led by Prince Sihanouk and Son Sann in their struggle against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. We have initiated stringent safeguards in both programs to ensure that the assistances does not end up with the Khmer Rouge. 
  
  >The Congressional Research Service has denied any knowledge of the information attributed to it." 

- The 1970s-80s position on Khmer Rouge is compliated, spanning several years. For this reason, I'll quote at length from a deep-dive [study](https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/Todd_Buchwald_Report_031819.pdf) on how the US addresses genocides over several decades, and why it takes certain actions over others. At no point did the US actually support, covertly or otherwise, Khmer Rouge.
 
   "The Cambodia case is complicated. There is a widespread public understanding that the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge government during its 1975-1978 rule constituted genocide, but a large portion of its atrocities were directed against the “wrong” kinds of groups—political and social groups, as opposed to “national, ethnical, racial or religious” groups—to fit neatly into the definition of genocide in the 1948 Convention. Indeed, only over time did it become well-understood that some of the atrocities—such as those directed against the ethnic Vietnamese and Cham—fit within the Convention’s definition.
 
   State Department lawyers recognized early the potential gap between the abuses and the Genocide Convention, and they expressed doubts internally that, at least on the basis of the facts as then known, the Khmer Rouge atrocities constituted genocide.162 Nevertheless, in September 1978, they proactively sought to stir the British government’s interest in bringing a formal genocide case against Cambodia in the Inter-national Court of Justice, telling their UK colleagues that the negative publicity generated by an ICJ case could inhibit further atrocities.163 In the end, the British lawyers concluded the substance of the allegation was too doubtful and declined to move forward with an ICJ case.164 As the Carter administration faced pressure to make clear how its human rights policy applied to this gravest of cases, its rhetorical condemnation of the Khmer Rouge came to include, on a handful of occasions, statements that at least obliquely characterised Khmer Rouge abuses as genocide.165

  Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia in December 1978 changed the geopolitical context. The Khmer Rouge were ousted and a government aligned with the Soviet Union was installed at a time when US ties with Moscow were fraught and relations with China were stronger. This shift in power created strong incen-tives for the United States to tamp down its rhetoric regarding the Khmer Rouge, as part of a broader decision by the United States to support the Cambodian opposition—which included the Khmer Rouge—in opposing Vietnam’s invasion as unlawful aggression. This extended to supporting the seating of Pol Pot’s ousted regime to continue representing Cambodia in the United Nations.166 Fearful of reinforcing Vietnam’s argument that the Khmer Rouge’s crimes had justified its invasion, Carter administration officials appear to have ceased alluding to the ex-regime’s atrocities as genocide from early 1979, and in a number of instances instead used the term to describe the conduct of the Vietnam-backed successor government.167 Reagan Administration officials did use genocide language regarding the Khmer Rouge from time to time thereafter, though usually in the context of general statements about atrocities or Communist rule, rather than statements focused on Cambodia.168 Through all this, however, the State Department’s Office of the Legal Adviser had never formally concluded that the Khmer Rouge atrocities in fact fell within the definition of genocide.169

  The US government ultimately confronted the issue in a more systematic way in connection with the Cambodian peace talks that began with a multinational conference held in Paris in 1989, and continued in New York, Beijing, Jakarta, and elsewhere. In preparing for those peace talks and the negotiations of arrangements for power sharing in a potential transitional government, the US participants anticipated that the Vietnamese and their Cambodian allies would take every opportunity to justify the invasion—and the exclusion of the Khmer Rouge from a future government—by claiming that the invasion had saved Cambodia from “genocide” while, for their part, the Cambodian opposition would insist on character-izing the main issue as Vietnamese “settlers”—those who had come to Cambodia after the invasion and symbolized Vietnamese hegemony over the country. The twin issues of “genocide” and “settlers” perme-ated much of the 1989 conference and, predictably, the two sides were unable to agree on mention of the words.170 For its part, the United States saw no advantage in intervening in the debate and avoided stating a formal view on whether the atrocities constituted genocide.171

  After the 1989 conference ended without an agreement, key members of Congress sharply criticized the administration’s approach. They had expressed concern as early as 1979 that the Khmer Rouge were likely to fight their way back into power if Vietnam withdrew its forces from Cambodia without appro-priate arrangements in place to exclude them.172 As Vietnamese withdrawal now loomed, they expressed alarm that the US government was not taking a sufficiently hardline posture in ensuring arrangements that would prevent the Khmer Rouge from regaining power. At a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee hearing in September 1989, Chairman Stephen Solarz and Congressman Chester Atkins raised partic-ular concerns that the United States in Paris had not supported draft language that the Khmer Rouge was responsible for genocide—the deletion of which Atkins, at least, saw as giving the group legitimacy and facilitating its entry into a transitional government.173 They pressed Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Richard Solomon to say at the hearing whether “what happened in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979 can appropriately be characterized as genocide.” Solomon declined to provide a direct answer, saying that the legal definition was complex and that in any event there were practical concerns that using the word would bolster the Vietnamese negotiating position in the talks. Solomon’s unwillingness to use the word “genocide” appeared to fuel the Congressmen’s concerns about the US government’s posture toward the Khmer Rouge’s participation in a new government.174

  At a hearing two months later where Solomon’s deputy and the department’s deputy legal adviser testi-fied, Solarz and Atkins pressed the point again, as it had been anticipated they would. US officials had discussed how to answer these questions after the September hearing, though different participants have different recollections of the decision-making process. Unlike the later cases in Bosnia and Rwanda, it appears that no formal memorandum was prepared for approval by the secretary of state.175 In any event, the deputy legal adviser, Michael Young, testified that the Khmer Rouge had committed genocide, but said that he wanted to qualify his answer to make clear that the term “genocide” “seemed some-what under-inclusive for what [the Khmer Rouge] actually did.”176 Apparently perceiving even Young’s remarks as evasive, an annoyed Congressman Atkins cut off the explanation, saying that he had had enough of “namby-pamby sensitivities.”177

  The resistance to what Congressman Atkins viewed as parsing of the words by the administration witness was in some ways a harbinger of what we will see in later situations in which advocates became impa-tient with anything they perceived as equivocation. In any event, the State Department provided a formal written answer after the hearing that made clear the point that the deputy legal adviser had wanted to make—i.e., that it was only the attacks against particular groups that constituted genocide. His answer stated —
  >The Convention’s definition of genocide does not, however, address the full extent of atrocities committed by members of the Khmer Rouge. Mass murder not intended to destroy any of [the groups mentioned] is not genocide under the Convention, regardless of the numbers killed. Because much of the Khmer Rouge slaughter was random, politically motivated, or the result of harsh conditions imposed on society at large, many acts would probably not constitute genocide as defined in the Convention. 

- It is charged by political pundists that the US Military during the Vietnam war, the stratergy was strategy of civilian slaughter sanctioned by American leaders—not only is this contradicted by the Rules of Engagement, as detailed in the following sections—but as  Fred L. Borch, a Military Historian & Archivist finds, "The vast majority of professional historians reject this view; they do not find that the historical record supports the conclusion that war crimes resulted from institutional flaws in the Army and its culture. In his highly acclaimed [America in Vietnam](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/america-in-vietnam-9780195027327?cc=cz&lang=en&#), political scientist Guenter Lewy examined American strategy and tactics in Vietnam between 1961 and 1975, and analyzed hundreds of after action reports of military operations, command directive, field reports, and staff studies of pacification efforts. He also looked at courts-martial records and war crimes investigations. Lewy concluded that “charges of officially condoned illegal and grossly illegal conduct are without substance.” As Lewy demonstrates, the Army did not ignore misconduct by its Soldiers. On the contrary, the Army “kept statistics on the number of [war crimes] allegations made and their disposition.” For Lewy, this was proof that the Army as an institution was not turning a blind eye to war crimes committed by Americans in uniform. In Vietnam, senior commanders in fact took their responsibilities under the law of armed conflict seriously. In [Law at War: Vietnam 1964-1973](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/law-at-war/law-at-war.pdf), an official study published by the Army’s Center of Military History, author George S. Prugh explains that the Commander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), considered creating special war crimes teams (to both investigate and prosecute these offenses). Ultimately, however, General William C. Westmoreland decided that this was not needed since the laws prohibiting war crimes were clear and the administrative and judicial machinery for investigating and punishing such offenses was sufficient. Westmoreland did, however, establish detailed rules governing the investigation of war crimes. Of particular importance is MACV Directive 20-4, which not only required the reporting of any war crime alleged to have been committed by U.S. personnel, but made it a criminal offense to fail to make such report. Finally, it was American military lawyers in Vietnam who were responsible for convincing their South Vietnamese counterparts that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were applicable to the conflict (thereby ensuring that international law governed the treatment of enemy combatants), and that it was Army lawyers who, intent on complying with the Conventions, authored rules governing the treatment of detained persons, including innocent civilians and civil defendants."
 
- In the 1975 Australian Constitutional Crisis, CIA nor Royal Crown had any involvement in the dismissal. All historians and investigations confirm this is an unsupported [conspiracy theory](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/arthur-tange-the-cia-and-the-dismissal/).

- During the Vietnam war, the US deployed herbicides to allow better troop movement in the jungle. This was known as Operation Ranch Hand.
Unknown to the US, one of its agents, agent orange, was toxic. Agent Orange was actually safe, however, a contamination issue occurred during the manufacture of 2,4,5,T. This was what was toxic: 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). [Contamination](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780306422478) was between less than 0.05 to almost 50 parts per million, with a mean of about 2 parts per million. As noted by the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/items/show/1318), "Until early 1973, there were no analytical techniques available with sensitivity and specificity sufficient to detect the extremely small quantities of TCDD likely to be present in the environment." This, of course, means that the contamination of TCDD couldn't be detected between 1961 and 1971.  Allegations that it was used to harm/kill combatants or civilians is [false](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/98481.pdf). The US did deploy one of its agents [_briefly_ to target _few, select_ crops belonging to the viet cong](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/28/2001329797/-1/-1/0/AFD-100928-054.pdf). The Americans were very reluctant to do this, however, South Vietnam insisted its use. The US only accepted under very strict controls & criteria, and if the South Government would guarantee humanitarian supplies should it be needed. 

- Napalm, Cluster munitions and other incindary bombs were used in Vietnam. Their deployement was subject to careful approval on select miltiary targets only, and after CIVCAS mitigation efforts were completed, thus satisfacory to the Geneva Conventions.<sup>[1](https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/2251871/View+the+PDF/ee82f732-b0b4-4275-b230-5be04ad16474#page=101)</sup></sup>  

- In July 1972, the Hanoi propaganda effort ramped up, claiming the US deliberately attacked several Dikes, causing civilian casualties. However, an [independent, internal review](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T00875R001700040062-8.pdf) confirmed this not to be the case. "A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital dike system. A few dikes have been hit, apparently by stray bombs directed at military-associated targets nearby. The observable damage is minor and no major dike has been breached."

- Operation Linebacker 1, from May 9 to October 23, 1972 and Operation Linebacker 2, from December 18 to December 29, 1972 were bombing campaigns against North Vietnam. North Vietnam illegally invaded South Vietnam, which triggered Operation Linebacker 1, targeting their military supply lines, etc. This was a successful effort in forcing the North to the peace table. However, the North Vietnam Government stalled peace talks, while trying to secretly build their forces. This prompted the Nixon Admin to begin Linebacker 2. A shorter campaign that while effective, was surrounded by disinformation alleging "indiscriminate targeting of civilians". An [independent assessment](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA191278/page/n1/mode/2up) concludes, "that the Linebacker campaigns were militarily effective and that, had AFP 110-31 been in effect in 1972, the campaigns, as they were actually conducted, would have conformed to the pamphlet's restrictions on aerial bombardment. These campaigns demonstrate that the pamphlet's rules on aerial bombardment are practical and can be complied with, given the proper technology and a conscious effort by commanders, their staffs, and aircrews."
 
   A [scholarly paper](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/1983_Vol34_No1-6/1983_Vol34_No2.pdf) from W. Hays Park, a world-leading LOAC expert, also confirms these operations were in compliance with international law, and details the efforts to mitigate collateral damage and civilian casualties. He concludes, "Both Linebacker campaigns were also conducted with an acute awareness by the military of its responsibilities under the law of war, with mission parameters well within the prohibitions of the law. Although unprecedented in the degree of precaution taken by an attacker to minimize collateral injury to the civilian population of an enemy, each campaign was successful  in attaining its objectives." 
   
- In the early 1970s, allegations of CIA's complicity in illegal drug trafficking in Laos (and the broader Golden Triangle). One such popular perpetrator of this lie was Alfred W. McCoy's 'The politics of heroin in Southeast Asia'. However, this book, and media claims of this were far from the facts of reality. CIA Headquarters and Stations in Asia actively pressured the resistance groups they aided from engaging in such activities, such as driving the Yao chieftain Chao out of the business; the Agency also made sure no US assets would be used for illegal smuggling. CIA's sensitivities to the illegal activity was so great, that one "acting chief of security once proposed a sting operation, with narcotics on an Air America plane going to Saigon used to lure traffickers there into a trap. Devlin imagined the press hysteria that would result if word got out about drugs moving on the CIA's airline, and he rejected the idea on the spot." Other details of CIA efforts to counter the narcotics smuggling can be found in the declassified study, '[Undercover Armies, CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/6-UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf)'

- In 1970, in Cambodia, the CIA had no involvement in Prince Sihanouk's coup. The list's own wiki citation even admits there is no evidence. 

- In 1965, the United States with South Vietnam the air campaign under the [Rolling Thunder program](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T02095R000900070018-0.pdf). This program resulted in [effective military gains](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00472A000800020017-1.pdf), while producing very few civilian casualties: Between [3,900 and 5,400](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T02095R000900070009-0.pdf) and [34,000, of which 21,000 were killed](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78S02149R000200020003-4.pdf) by then-standards. The second study reviews all propaganda claims made by the North Vietnam regime and concludes most of them false and inaccurate. The purpose of the program was to impede the North regime's supply of weapons and men to aid insurgent groups in the South, and in the long-term make continued physical support to insurgents too costly for North Vietnam.
Another detailed overview of the program can be found [here](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80T01629R000300080014-9.pdf) From target selection to casualty estimates, to goals, etc. A [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20161106133619/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/parks.html) by one of the world's leading law of war experts, concludes that it complied with, and far exceeded international law,"Rolling Thunder was one of the most constrained military campaigns in history. The restrictions imposed by this nation’s civilian leaders were not based on the law of war but on an obvious ignorance of the law —to the detriment of those sent forth to battle."

- Many pundits and historical revisionists allege the US was behind the 1965 coup in Indonesia. The 30 September Movement. This couldn't be furthest from the truth. In the declassified publication, _[The lessons of the September 30 affair](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017175932/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol14no2/pdf/v14i2a02p.pdf)_ a fantastic summary of events is detailed, however a brief mention to the largest, comprehensive and authoritative study is summized, "In her study _[The Coup that backfired](https://web.archive.org/web/20171208040813/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-40.pdf)_, Ms Helen Hunter went a long way toward dispelling the myth of the Chinese Communist involvement in the purge attempt. She concluded that while Peking had probable learned of the Sukarno/PKI plan, as indeed it must have through agent penetration of the Palace and the PKI, the Chinese did not instigate the plot or participate in carrying it out. The same conclusion is implicit in an earlier article in _studies in Intelligence_ in _[The September 30 Movement](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123064222/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010008-4.pdf)_ by John T. Pizzicaro.
Like us, the Chinese knew something important was imminent. But I doubt whether they could truly have comprehended the nature of the plot and its implications."
CIA had [no involvement](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf) in the assassination is also confirmed by the declassified Rockefeller commission.

- The Vietnam war and the US' entire air campaign; counter to many historical revisionists, was actually hampered by strict Rules of Engagement that often left the Military allowing the Vietcong to remain safe, even though they're far clear of any surrounding civilian populations. In another [scholarly paper](https://www.loc.gov/law/mlr/Military_Law_Review/27687D~1.pdf) by a world-leading legal expert and practitioner, it was found while studying Air Force ROEs, "the policy of gradualism, implemented by the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1968, resulted in ROE of unprecedented detail and restrictiveness." Indeed, an [internal air force study](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA597620/page/n1/mode/2up) prior concluded the same, "military barracks were prohibited. The suppression of SAMS and gun-laying radar systems was prohibited in this area as were attacks on NVN air bases from which attacking aircraft might be operating."

- In 1950, it was alleged that A US airstrike deliberately targeted South Korean refugees in the village of Nogeun-ri.
An [independent and authoritative investigation](https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/armymil/www.army.mil/nogunri/default.htm) summarised as follows:
"Over the last year, the Review Team has conducted an exhaustive factual review by examining over a million documents from the National Archives, conducting interviews with approximately 200 American witnesses, and analyzing the interview transcripts and oral statements of approximately 75 Korean witnesses.  The U.S. Review Team also closely examined press reports, aerial imagery, and other forensic examination results.  This U.S. Report reflects the U.S. Review Team’s factual findings based upon all the evidence available on the incident. During late July 1950, Korean civilians were caught between withdrawing U.S. forces and attacking enemy forces.  As a result of U.S. actions during the Korean War in the last week of July 1950, Korean civilians were killed and injured in the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  The Review Team did not find that the Korean deaths and injuries occurred exactly as described in the Korean account.  To appraise these events, it is necessary to recall the circumstances of the period.  U.S. forces on occupation duty in Japan, mostly without training for, or experience in, combat were suddenly ordered to join ROK forces in defending against a determined assault by well-armed and well-trained NKPA forces employing both conventional and guerilla warfare tactics.  The U.S. troops had to give up position after position.  In the week beginning July 25, 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division, withdrawing from Yongdong toward the Naktong River, passed through the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  Earlier, roads and trails in South Korea had been choked with civilians fleeing south.  Disguised NKPA soldiers had mingled with these refugees.  U.S. and ROK commanders had published a policy designed to limit the threat from NKPA infiltrators, to protect U.S. forces from attacks from the rear, and to prevent civilians from interfering with the flow of supplies and troops.  The ROK National Police were supposed to control and strictly limit the movements of innocent refugees.
In these circumstances, especially given the fact that many of the U.S. soldiers lacked combat-experienced officers and Non-commissioned officers, some soldiers may have fired out of fear in response to a perceived enemy threat without considering the possibility that they might be firing on Korean civilians." 

- In 1950s, The Soviet Union, China and North Korea started propaganda that the US had used Biological weapons against civilians and combatants. This has been a long-debunked conspiracy theory.<sup>[1](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/leitenberg_biological_weapons_korea.pdf)</sup></sup> Tactics used by China and NK include the establishment of [fake Scientific panels, presenting fabricated evidence](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/250/korean-war-biological-warfare-allegations).

A number of academic papers refute Soviet/Russian BW disinformation.<sup>[1](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2021-10/NonProliferationReview_False%20allegations%20of%20biological%20weapons%20use%20from%20Putin%20s%20Russia.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2021-10/NonProliferationReview%20Supplemental%20material_rnpr_a_1964755_sm5635.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1968, My Lai was substantiated by the [Peers investigation](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RDAR-Vol-I.pdf). Those responsible were held to account. Since then, nothing like it has returned. However the list incorrectly states it was between 347-504 civivlians killed. It was 175.

- In 1967, the South Vietnamese government operated a program called Phung Hoang or Phoenix. CIA aided in it, but it was [not theirs](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000300130040-4.pdf). It has been alleged that it was an assassination/torture program—this is [not true](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R000800090012-8.pdf). Since independent actions against the CVI were deemed inefficient and ineffective, the Phung Hoang program was conceived to unite and coordinate a total government effort against the VCI. As such, Phung Hoand represented an intelligence coordination mechanism—in the form of coordinating committees at the province, regional and national level; and intelligence and operations coordinating centers at the province and district level—which aimed at a united total governmental effort against the CVI. It was _not_ a program of assassination or terror in response to Communist terror, and the program did not authorise torture, brutality or cruel methods in the interrogation or handling of captives. The US further worked with the Government to make sure [adequate, humane treatment as focal, observing fair concepts of due process and improve conditions of internment](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001100060018-1.pdf).

- In 1953, an insurgent pseudo-nationalist, the Pathet Lao, under the control of North Vietnam started an insurrection against the Royal Government of Laos. Their false propaganda has been [well documented](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R000600080007-0.pdf) and widely disregarded by academics and historians. The US, responding within the [framework of the Geneva Agreements](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001300050007-2.pdf), supplied military equipment and supplies for the Lao armed forces. This was within the provisions of Article 6 of the Protocol to the Declaration the Neutrality of Laos signed in Geneva in 1962. Because of the consistent refusal by the Pathet Lao to allow the ICC teams to enter their territory to inspect alleged violations of the Geneva agreement, the first American reconnaissance flight was flown over the southern part of Laos on 19 May 1964 after consultations with Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma the previous day. On 28 May 1964 Souvanna Phouma publicly endorsed these recon missions over Laos stating that they were necessary to observe communist violations of the Accords.

- It has been alleged that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a US false flag to justify the Vietnam war, and that it's admitted in the declassified record. This is a well-debunked myth. The list cites a wiki entry, which cites to a declassified NSA document as evidence. However, problems arise when one actually reads the document in question. 1) It's an opinion piece in NSA's Cryptologic Quarterly. 2) The author in the study actually cautions against a conspiracy theory take, "This mishandling of SIGINT was not done in a manner that can be construde as conspiratorial , that is, with manufactured evidence and collusion at all levels. Rather, the objective of these individuals was to support the Navy's claim that the Desoto patrol had been deliberately attacked by the North Vietnamese." It's worth noting as well, that the NSA, while appreciative of the study, [disagrees](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/gulf-of-tonkin/articles/release-2/rel2_thoughts_intelligence.pdf) with the author's central premise: That SIGINT/COMINT was mishandled. According to the response, "This article does dispute Mr. Hanyok's assertion that SIGINT was mishandled, deliberately skewed or not provided to the Johnson administration. In fact, the record shows that NSA performed magnificently during this period of crisis, providing all SIGINT available in a timely manner to a broad spectrum of customers. With only a few trained Vietnamese linguists at NSA Headquarters and field stations analyzing encrypted North Vietnamese communications, NSA still provided U.S. forces advance warning of possible intended attacks that quite likely prevented the sinking of a U.S. destroyer on 2 August.

  Further evidence refuting the claim that COMINT information was presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964 can be found in the NSA review of Secretary McNamara's testimony before Congress. NSA noted that McNamara systematically used overkill language with COMINT and that the COMINT surrounding Tonkin was "flexible for interpretation". Again in 1972, as noted by Mr. Hanyok, NSA Deputy Director Dr. Tordella provided Senator Fulbright's staff director Carl Marcy access to all NSA material relating to the Gulf of Tonkin and told Mr. Marcy that the intercept of 4 August could indeed refer to events that occurred on 2 August.
  
  These facts make it clear that NSA consistently provided the Administration, as well as Congress, all COMINT information related to the events of 2-4 August. In fact, one NSA manager present during the August 1964 events has stated, "the folks downtown were provided all of the COM INT as they wanted to do their own analysis. They weren't overly interested in what we thought." Some would argue that NSA should have explicitly informed decision makers in formal SIGINT reporting that COMINT showed there was no attack on 4 August. However, the available COMINT could not support such a position. While some analysts did indeed come to such a conclusion, the COMINT itself, as noted by Dr. Tordella, was "flexible for interpretation".

  In the final analysis, it is clear that not only was SIGINT information _not_ presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964, but that all of the COM INT produced was distributed to CIA, JCS, DIA and other customers and that NSA uncertainties, even of single words, were made known to decision makers."
  
- In the summer of 1950 in South Korea, South Korea engaged in a massacre. British and US Governments tried to prevent it, and managed to save a large number of civilians. United States official documents show that John J. Muccio, then United States Ambassador to South Korea, made recommendations to South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo that the executions be stopped. Great Britain raised this issue with the U.S. at a diplomatic level, causing Dean Rusk, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, to inform the British that U.S. commanders were doing "everything they can to curb such atrocities".[8] During the massacre, the British protected their allies and saved some citizens.

- CIA has [no involvement](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2018/104-10214-10036.pdf) in the 1963 assassination/coup in Vietnam of President Diem.
  
- Several studies of US post-WW2 activities, policies and views have been made public, and offer the most detailed overview of 3 decades (50s-70s) in Asia:
  - _[US Intelligence and Vietnam](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123192047/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001433692.pdf)_ is an independent study designed to undertake a detailed examination of finished intelligence relating to the Vietnam conflict from the time of introduction of US combat forces in 1965 through the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975. In settling on the scope of the study, it was decided to go back to the beginning of the American involvement in Indochina toward the end of World War II and cover at least the major developments that occurred during a period of approximately three decades. 1945-1975.
  - A compendium, _[Estimative Products on Vietnam: 1948-1975](https://chinhnghia.com/Vietnam_1948-1975_Book.pdf)_ provides a lengthy, detailed overview before the documents.
  - Thomas Ahern Jr.'s monograph, _[CIA and Rural Pacification in South Vietnam](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf)_ which details CIA's efforts to win the "hearts and minds" of the South Vietnamese rural population. It's a compelling account of CIA's contributions to the US effort  to establish and preserve an independent nation in South Vietnam. Despite local success, the CIA effort was, in the end, part of a major tragedy. No one, either in Washington or in the field, grasped the immense complexity and difficulty in instituting a massive effort to control the contryside, win the support of the peasantry, and promote political reforms, while fighting a determined and entrenched enemy.
  - _[Baptism by fire: CIA analysis of the Korean War](https://web.archive.org/web/20170911114643/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/international-relations/korean-war-baptism-by-fire/baptism-by-fire.pdf)_ Notes, among other things, that the Truman administration believed that the USSR orchestrated the Korean War.

  - _[CIA and the House of Ngo](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/2-CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf)_ notes how the CIA aided in establishing a civilian government in South Vietnam. As Diem became more authoritarian and suppressive of minorities, the US tried to persuade him to abide by human rights, however, upon this failing, encouraged but was not involved in, the coup by the military. Ahern traces CIA efforts  to  bring  stability  and  democracy  to  South  Vietnam  and to influence Diem. Although not uncritical of US  policy and CIA operations, Ahern's study reveals a CIA Station-indeed in the early  years, two Stations-working diligently and effectively to aid Diem in forming  a viable  state.
  - _[CIA and the Generals](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/1-CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf)_  "illustrates Saigon Station efforts to work with and understand the various military  governments  of  South  Vietnam which followed Diem,  and carefully details CIA attempts to stabilize and urge democratization on the changing military regimes."

- In 1945, it has been alleged that Douglas MacArthur pardoned the Japanese unit 731, a unit involved in biological weapons testing.
During the interrogations for war crimes prosecutions, the members gave up information to the US, however, [no evidence](https://networks.h-net.org/node/20904/reviews/21143/fouraker-harris-factories-death-japanese-biological-warfare-1932-1945) indicates that MacArthur pardoned anyone.

- US Fire bombings in Germany and Japan, as well as the use of nuclear weapons fell well within international law at the time As one of the world's leading experts [notes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2924907), "President Truman’s classification of the bombing as a purely military objective has caused  some  historians to speculate that the President  engaged in “self-deception.”4  Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate. Although Hiroshima was not a military  base as understood today, it was  a “military city”  as it housed the 2d Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan.5 The city was also a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops...  Nagasaki’s  military  industry  made it significant. The  atomic  bomb  landed between  the two principal targets in the city:  the Mitsubishi Steel and Arm Works and  the  Mitsubishi-Uramaki  Ordnance  Works (Torpedo  Works).
 The atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lawful under the laws of war existing in 1945. These attacks also represent the only two instances  of  atomic  weapon  strikes in  history. They illustrate the definitional confusion existing with respect  to  the  U.S. classification  of lawful military  objects exclusive of civilian  objects. If some  historians  believe President Truman  was  engaged in “self-deception” in labelling Hiroshima a military target, those historians may be equally perplexed by modern American usage of law-of-war target labels."
 
- Between October/November 1901, during the Philippine–American War in the battle of Samar, General Jacob H. Smith is famously quoted as ordering, “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill and burn the better you will please me... The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness.”
When asked by Major Waller asked about the age of those to whom he should apply this guidance, Smith replied that males over ten years old should be considered as being capable of bearing arms. This is cited as evidence that Smith ordered unlawful killings and atrocities against the villagers. This narrative, however, ignores some key facts: When court-martialed for their actions on Samar. Waller would testify that rather than taking the order literally, his interpretation of Smith’s intemperate guidance was, “that the General wanted all insurrectionists killed... people who were bearing arms against Americans... I understood that we were not to  take prisoners if they were armed.” In fact, Waller testified that he cautioned his officers that “we were not sent here to make war on women and children and old men." While smith was seen as ruthless and excessively forceful, "... a circular he is-sued on 18 November 1901 specifically sought to ensure that accommodating natives were cared for: “Emphasis is laid upon the point that the brigade commander desires not only to permit proper food supplies to reach all friendly natives,  but he particularly desires that these supplies do so reach them." Besides this, Smith was was "not tried for issuing illegal orders or for inciting war crimes. Instead, he was charged with 'conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline' for the excessive nature of his orders. A military court headed by Maj. Gen. Loyd Wheaton, who had commanded the Department of North Philippines, that convened in Manila in April 1902 found General Smith guilty of instructing  Waller to “kill and burn” as  much as possible and not take any prisoners. Commenting on this verdict three months later, Secretary of War Elihu Root described the  language Smith was convicted of using as containing “intemperate, inconsiderate, and violent expressions, which, if accepted literally, would grossly violate the humane rules governing American armies in the field.” But the court exercised leniency and sentenced Smith merely to be 'admonished by the reviewing authority.' It  justified this outcome by concluding that Smith “did not mean everything that his unexplained language implied; that his subordinates did not gather such a meaning;  and that the orders were never executed in such sense.” Root commented, “Fortunately they [Smith’s instructions] were not taken literally and were not followed. No  women or children or helpless persons or noncombatants or prisoners were put to death in pursuance of them." Smith was still forced out of the Military for his actions. Others were also convicted and served life in prison for unlawful acts unrelated to Smith.<sup>[1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26296824?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents)</sup></sup>

## USA/Domestic matters
- In 2016, activists and media pundits decried the building of the Dakota Access pipeline, that crosses 4 states. Myths and disinformation ran wild, so here are the [facts](https://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/The-Facts.html):
   - The Dakota Access pipeline is not built on Native American reservations. 99.98% of the pipeline is installed on privately owned property in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. The Dakota Access Pipeline does not enter the Standing Rock Sioux reservation at any point.
   - Eight other pipelines currently run below Lake Oahe. In fact, existing pipelines have safely transported natural gas beneath Lake Oahe for more than 30 years.
   - The Dakota Access Pipeline was approved by regulatory agencies in all four states where the pipeline will operate and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   - Tribes were consulted hundreds of times while DAPL route was planned. In developing the route, the United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was reviewed. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the Dakota.
   - The Dakota Access Pipeline has not impacted groundwater in any of the four states through which it passes since going into service in June of 2017.
   - The Dakota Access Pipeline does not encroach on water supply; the Standing Rock Sioux's water intake has been moved to a location about 75 miles away from the pipeline.
   - The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation, also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes and located in North Dakota, use the Dakota Access Pipeline to transport more than 60% of the oil they produce.
   - In August of 2018, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed more than a year of additional study of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, saying the work substantiated its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats.
   - Were tribes consulted on the Dakota Access Pipeline? Yes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was under review. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the pipeline route. During the planning phase, Dakota Access worked with the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer and contracted professionally licensed archaeologists to conduct Class II and Class III cultural surveys. Indeed, as a Court [found](https://mwalliancenow.org/news/memorandum-opinion-judge-standing-rock-sioux-tribe-v-us-army-corps-engineers/), "In fact, on this record, it appears that the Corps exceeded its NHPA obligations at many of the PCN sites."
   - The protests cost the state of North Dakota a lot of resources and money. According to local law enforcement, protesters provoked multiple dangerous and criminal confrontations and caused significant damage to property. Additional police were brought in from all over the country to help during the protests. North Dakota's congressional delegation has asked the federal government for $38 million to cover the cost of policing the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Approximately 21 million pounds of trash, debris and waste was ultimately removed from the protest site at Lake Oahe, costing over $1 million in clean up and causing significant concern for the health of the lake. Corps Capt. Ryan Hignight said a total of 8,170 cubic yards of debris was removed from the three camps - Sacred Stone, Oceti Sakowin and Rosebud - all within the flood plain on federally managed land. In 2017, Energy Transfer gifted the state of North Dakota $15 million to help cover costs.

- In 2014, media headlines claimed a paper proved that the US was an oligarchy. Several papers have critiqued this paper based on deeply flawed methodology. The consensus in literature disregard the claim.<sup>[1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/relative-policy-support-and-coincidental-representation/BBBD524FFD16C482DCC1E86AD8A58C5B)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/polq.12577)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168015608896)</sup></sup>

- In early January of 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Order ordering the Secretary of Defense to "immediately undertake a review of the conditions of detention at Guantanamo to ensure full compliance with this directive." This report, submitted on 2/23/09, conforms with that order by setting out the conditions and conclusions:
  The Secretary of Defense tasked a special DoD team to review the conditions of confinement at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, to ensure all detainees there are being held “in conformity with all applicable laws governing the conditions of confinement, including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions,” pursuant to the President’s Executive Order on Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities, 
dated January 22, 2009. The Review Team conducted 13 days of investigation on site that included more than 100 interviews with JTF-Guantánamo leadership, support staff, interrogators, and guards, multiple announced and unannounced inspections of all camps during daylight and night operations, reviewed numerous reports, video, discipline records, and observed many aspects of daily operations. Collectively, we talked to a number of detainees and observed 
detainee activities, including enteral feedings and interrogations. The review Team also solicited a sampling of opinion, studies, and published works, which reflected the perspective of detainees and other concerned interest groups, many with recommendations to improve detention 
conditions. This included our request for additional views from four organizations who wrote to the President concerning Guantánamo on January 30, 2009: Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International. These organizations responded to that request on February 6, 2009, and their submissions were carefully considered. After considerable deliberation and a comprehensive review, it is our judgment that the conditions of confinement in Guantánamo are in conformity with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2918343/Review-of-Department-Compliance-With-Presidents.pdf)</sup></sup>

  It is worth noting as well that even the least compliant detainees at Guantanamo Bay are provided with two to eight hours a day of recreation, quarterly meetings with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), ICRC messages, mail, skype, and phone access, Halal meals with several menu choices, prayer beads, prayer rugs, and other religious accommodations, as well as a library, 178 satellite TV stations, 79 satellite radio stations, classes, movies, and video games.<sup>[2](https://www.lawfareblog.com/federal-prosecution-viable-option-enemy-combatants)</sup></sup> Where hunger strike was concerned, the SOP was the following:
  
  A JMG medical provider will counsel the detainee who is on hunger strike as to the medical hazards of a prolonged period without food and/or water. The medical staff shall explain the medical risks faced by the detainee and make a reasonable effort to convince the detainee to resume eating food and drinking water.<sup>[3](https://www.aele.org/law/gitmo-force-feed.pdf)</sup></sup>

- After 9/11, the US passed into law the Patriot Act. [A law that streamlined many already-existing laws at a federal level](https://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/subs/add_myths.htm). It, along with the USA Patriot Improvement Act, [strengthened privacy and civil liberties protections](https://www.justice.gov/archive/911/legal.html)
A detailed overview of one of the PA's provisions can be found [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/750227-patriot-act-section-215-white-paper.html) and a deep-dive [here](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/On-the-Bulk-Collection-of-Tangible-Things.pdf)
For an overall view of surveillance changes post 9/11 see [here](https://www.alston.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/peter-swire-testimony-documents/professorpeterswiretestimonyinirishhighcourtcase.pdf) Chapter 5 details the many means in which the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court holds the Government's feet to the fire, via various mechanisms—via a systematic evaluation of the declassified record. "The  FISC has  been criticized in some media outlets as a “rubber stamp,” particularly  in the  wake  of  the  Snowden  disclosures. This section shows how recently-declassified materials are not consistent with that claim. In my view, the FISC exercises effective oversight, backed by constitutional authority, over government applications to conduct surveillance."
The Chapter is divided into four sections: 
   - I. The  newly  declassified  materials  support  theconclusion  that  the  FISC  today provides  independent  and  effective  oversight  over  US  government  surveillance. Especially since the Snowden disclosures, the FISC was criticized in some media outlets as a “rubber stamp.”  This section shows  that  this  claim is  incorrect. It examines  FISC  opinions  illustrating  the court’s care in  reviewing  proposed surveillance.  For many years, an important role of the FISC was to insist that the Department  of  Justiceclearly  document  its  surveillance  requests,  with  the  effect the  Department  would  only  go  through  that  effort  for  high-priority  requests.  Since  the  passage  of  the  USA  FREEDOM  Act,  the  number  of  surveillance applications  that  the  FISC has modified  or  rejected  has,at  least  initially,grownsubstantially,  to  17  percent  of  surveillance  applications  inthe  second  half  of2015.6The section closes  by  showing  the  FISC’s  willingness  to  exercise  its constitutional power to restrict surveillance that it believes is unlawful.
  - II. The FISC monitors compliance with its orders, and has enforced with significant sanctions  in  cases  of  noncompliance.  The FISC’s jurisdiction is not confined to approving   surveillance   applications.      The   FISC   also   monitors   government compliance  and  enforces  its  orders.    This section outlines  the  interlocking  rules, third-party  audits,  and  periodic  reporting  that  provide  the  FISC  with  notice  of compliance  incidents.    It  then  discusses  examples  of  the  FISC’s  responses  to government noncompliance.  FISC  compliance decisions have resulted in (1) the National  Security  Agency(NSA)electing  to  terminate  an Internet  metadata collection   program;   (2)substantial   privacy-enhancing   modifications   to   the Upstream  program;  (3)  the  deletion  of  all  data  collected  via  Upstream  prior  to October  2011;  and  (4)  a  temporary  prohibition  on  the  NSA  accessing  one  of  its own databases. 

   - III. In  recent  years,  both  the  FISC  on  its  own  initiative  and  new  legislation  have greatly increased transparency.  Under the original structure of FISA, enacted in 1978,  the  FISC in many respects was a “secret court” –the  public  knew  of  its existence  but  had  very  limited  information  about  its  operations.    This section describes  how,  in  recent  years,  the  FISC  itself  began  to  release  more  of  its  own opinions and procedures, and the USA FREEDOM Act now requires the FISC to disclose  important  interpretations  of  law.It  also  discusses  how  litigation  before the FISC resulted intransparency reporting rights, and how these rights have been codified into US surveillance statutes.

   - IV. The FISC now receives and will continue to benefit from briefing by parties other than  the  Department  of  Justice  in  important  cases.   Originally,  the  main  task  of the FISC was to issue an individual wiretap order, such as for one Soviet agent at a time. Aswith other search warrants, these proceedings were ex parte, with the Department of Justicepresenting its evidence to the FISC for review. After 2001, the  FISC  played  an  expanded  role  in  overseeing  entire  foreign  intelligence programs, such as under Section 215 and Section 702.  In light of the more legally complex issues that these programs can raise, there was an increasing recognition that  judges  would  benefit  from  briefing  by  parties  other  than  the Department  of Justice.    This section reviews  newly  declassified materials concerning  how  the FISC  began  to  receive  such  briefing  of  its  own  initiative.    Prior  to  the  USA FREEDOM Act,  the  FISC  created  some  opportunities  for privacy  experts  and communication services  providers  to  brief  the  court.    The  USA FREEDOM Act has created a set of six experts in privacy and civil liberties who will have access to classified information and will brief the court in important cases.
No country on earth comes as close to transparency or to the protectinons of privacy and civil liberties compared to the US, [even for non-citizens](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5003660-PCLOB-PPD28-Report.html) "PPD-28 was a milestone. It responded to an important and difficult issue in US foreign intelligence practice: How to conduct necessarily robust collection of communications data outside the United States while respecting the privacy rights of non-US persons — privacy rights inherent, according to the long-standing policy of the United States, in all human beings. By codifying for the first time significant limits on intelligence activities affecting non-US persons outside the United States, the directive gave substance to our government's claim to respect the human rights of all individuals. It affirmed and strengthened the role of the United States as the world's leader by (1) establishing express limits on intelligence activities, even as it reaffirmed the need for robust intelligence capabilities; (2) promoting transparency about those limits; and the (3) establishing a greater degree of equivalence, where feasible, between protections for the personel information of US persons and non-US persons."

   Indeed the above review said, "We urge the CIA _not_ to apply the PPD-28's retention rules to [blank] unless it develops a way to avoid over-application of the Directive." and that, "The CIA, for example, has decided to apply PPD-28 to a broad range of activities, including some that it explicity acknowledged "are not SIGINT." Of course, PPD-28 didn't change NSA's activities that much, as the report notes, "NSA's past practice was to limit all signals intelligence activities, including the dissemination of personal information of non-US persons in disseminated SIGINT products, to those necessary to accomplish its foreign intelligence mission." A basic overview of how the FISC works can be found [here](https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-fisa-court-really-works), written by the world's leading authority, who has written three editions of a treatise that is widely is considered, by many scholars and practitioners of naional security law, to be the [bible](https://store.legal.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/Treatises/National-Security-Investigations-and-Prosecutions-3d/p/106604908) of the subject.

   One may be forgiven to think this is "just on paper", alas, that is not so. Thousands of declassified pages confirm that these governing laws, policy and guidance are all followed. Where honest mistakes are made, they are corrected promptly. 
Lets look at 4 such records, that cover, in total, almost decades—from 9/11 to 2019.
   
  - [ST-09-0002](https://archive.org/details/JointIGreviewPSP/page/n129/mode/2up?view=theater) "NSA activity conducted under the PSP was authorised by Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) orders by 17 Janurary 2007, when NSA stopped operating under PSP authority. The NSA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) detected _no intentional misuse of Program authority._"
   
   - [18th Joint Assessment](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/18th_Joint_Assessment.pdf) "Consistent with previous Joint Assessments, no instances of intentional circumvention or violation of those procedures were found during this reporting period."
   
   - [SID Oversight & Compliance](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/Letter%20from%20David%20S.%20Kris%2C%20Assistant%20Attorney%20General%2C%20to%20the%20Honorable%20John%20D.%20Bates%2C%20Presiding%20Judge%2C%20United%20States%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Court.pdf) "Conducted a complete (100 percent) audit of all PR/TT metadata queries, and this audit has confirmed that there has been no inappropriate access to the sensitive PR/TT metadata via intelligence analysis tools. Compliance audits have determined that the EAR has prevented all queries on non-RAS approved identifiers from accessing the metadata."
   
   - [Several](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2809657/Nsa-Ig-Bulk-Nyt-15-0811.pdf) NSA OIG reports confirm in monthly reporting instances of finding no non-compliance. Though it finds issues here and there, and provides recommendations. Not a single case of misuse/abuse was found. 

  None of the above involved "warrantless wiretapping either. It was always the case that to do surveillance on a US person, located in the US or outside the US, or an alian within the US: A warrant is required. PRISM/Upstram collection under FAA Sec. 702 cannot target USPs and are annually approved by FISC. The bulk collection of CDRs also wasn't a wiretap, and required Court order every 90 days. The above records provide details on this, but the following do as well:
 
   - [ST-14-0002](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/3IGReports-Sealed.pdf) Contains 3 OIG reviews but 14-0002  Covers 702 and 215 authorities. p. 224 for 702's PRISM/Upstream. p. 155 for bulk CDR.

  - [ODNI Infographic](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/Section702-Basics-Infographic.pdf) Provides a very basic rundown of how 702 works, oversight, value.

  - [Covers 702 targeting procedures](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/icotr/Assessment_Oversight_Compliance_702_Targeting_Procedures-Redacted.pdf) A small read (12 pages).

  - [Fleisch Decl.](https://fas.org/sgp/jud/statesec/jewel-fleisch.pdf) and [Bonanni Decl.](https://fas.org/sgp/jud/statesec/jewel-bonanni-redacted.pdf)
 These two are another good overview, though more basic to an extent, of the evolution from TSP to 702 and 215 authorities, etc.
also specifically debunks the notion of "key words"

- In 1993, a cultist group known as the Branch Davidians, engaged the law enforcement as they attempted to serve a search and arrest warrant on the ranch.
  Conspiracy theorists and pundits have claimed it was the ATF that caused the fire. This has been debunked in the official and independent [investigations](https://www.justice.gov/archives/publications/waco/report-deputy-attorney-general-events-waco-texas):
  
  "The arson team concluded that the fire was deliberately set by one or more persons inside the compound. The fire had three separate points of origin. The arson investigation established that those fires occurred in areas significantly distant from one another, but within such a short time frame that it was not possible for the fire to have been accidentally set or for it to have been caused by a single ignition.

  The arson team then discussed those factors that enhanced the spread of the fire. First, the team noted that the compound building had been poorly construction, with apparently no attention to fire safety. The team noted that the building "appears to have been built with a total disregard to any reasonable concern for fire prevention, especially considering its intended use as living quarters for numerous people."

  Second, the arson team attributed the rapid spread of the fire to the strong winds prevailing on April 19.

  Third, the arson team found that the openings created in the building's structure by the FBI during the six hours of the tear gas operation also helped vent the fire. However, the team also noted that the FBI's actions would have allowed more fresh air to flow through the structure while it was burning, thereby reducing the concentration of carbon monoxide and permitting more "breathable" air to reach those trapped inside.

  Fourth, the unusually large amount of combustible material stored inside the compound contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.

  Finally, the absence of fire suppression was a minor factor. The arson team explained that given a fire of this intensity and magnitude, it would have been difficult for a fire fighting team to have halted the fire. 

  Finally, the arson team addressed whether the fire could have been started by the FBI's deployment of tear gas into the compound. The team concluded that "the fire was not caused by nor was it intensified by any chemicals present in the tear-gassing operations." The team noted that the two methods used to deliver the gas were non-incendiary. The pressurized gas delivered through the combat engineering vehicles was sprayed through a nozzle using carbon dioxide as the propellant. The team noted that carbon dioxide would be incapable of igniting, and might even have acted as a fire inhibiting agent. The other method -- 40 mm Ferret cartridges delivered by an M79 hand-held launcher containing a nonburning, nonexplosive liquid agent containing methylene chloride as the carrier -- could not have had any incendiary effect either.

   The arson team likewise concluded that, given the multiple simultaneous points of origin, the fire could not possibly have been started by a ferret round entering a window and knocking over a container of flammable liquid. Moreover, the arson team concluded (contrary to a theory that has been advanced by certain people) that the fire could not have been started by one of the combat engineering vehicles rupturing a propane container and igniting it. If that had happened, according to the report, "an immediate vapor air explosion or flash fire would have occurred involving the vehicle itself. It did not happen." 
 
   The Fire Development Analysis:
 
   In addition to the arson investigation, which focused on the cause and origin of the fire, two experts from the University of Maryland's Department of Fire Protection Engineering traveled to Waco to investigate how the fire had developed and spread. Those two experts prepared a written "Fire Development Analysis" dated September 8, 1993. They reached the following conclusions:

   1. The fires in each of the three points of origin grew very quickly, each resulting in full room involvement within two minutes of initiation.
   2. The rapid growth rates of the fires resulted from an ignition source, probably liquid fuel, deliberately placed in each of the three points of origin.
   3. The rapid growth rates of the fires could not have been caused by a CEV accidentally tipping a lantern, nor by the chemical (methylene chloride) used as the dispersal agent for the CS tear gas.
   4. The strong winds did not significantly affect the fire growth rates inside the compound. The wind affected the external spread of flames, but not the initial rapid growth of the three fires to full room involvement.
   5. The tank-made openings on the first floor of the compound could have had some effect on the fire growth, but more likely provided fresh air to areas of refuge for some of the occupants.
   6. The compound residents had sufficient time to escape the fire, if they had so desired."

- Between 1974 and 75, it was alleged that the US Indian Health Service engaged in a forced sterilization effort against the natives without their consent. However, an independent 1976 GAO investigation [found](https://www.gao.gov/assets/hrd-77-3.pdf) this allegation baseless. Concluding:
  - We found no evidence that IHS sterilising Indians without a patient consent form on file, although we did find several weaknesses in complying with HEW's sterilization regulations. The primary weaknesses related to (1) sterilization of persons under 21 years of age, (2) inadequately documenting what the Indian subjects were told before singing the consent form (largely attributable to the the use of consent forms that failed to meet HEW standards), (3) lack of widespread physician understanding of the regulations, and (4) the lack of definitive requirements for informed consent when sterilizations are performed by contract doctors at contract facilities."

- In 1954, the US detonated a series of nuclear bombs to study their yield. This was part of Operation Castle, near Bikini Atoll. Due to a [miscalculation](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16380885-g1vuWf/16380885.pdf) (p. 205), there was an increase in radiation output than expected. The US Department of Energy estimated that 253 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were impacted by the radioactive fallout. It is alleged that the US deliberately used the Marshallese as "ginea pigs" for testing radiation. This allegation has been thoroughly investigated and is not supported by any evidence. [Operation Castle had no biomedical program](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16061854-leUIeE/16061854.pdf). US Military personnel were also exposed to large amounts of radiation, when they thought they were in safe areas of the _expected_ yield.

- In 1953, MKULTRA. There exists a rich universe of misleading allegations of MKULTRA, due to pop culture, and propagandists. To concisely and accurately represent the program, I'll quote at length from a declassified overview:

   >"Because of events in the 1940's and early 1950's, including operational reports and Soviet show trials involving Gardinal Mindzenty and others, the Soviet Union was believed to have developed the capability to affect human behavior through the use of drugs. To obtain information on the use of chemical and biological substances and methods to counter the use of behavior influencing drugs, the Agency conducted an  "umbrella project" under which various subprojects were funded. This umbrella project, which was called MKULTRA, continued from 1953 through 1964. Much of the research, only a portion of which involved LSD, was conducted at well-known institutions under the control and direction of researchers at, and in conformance to the standards of, those institutions. The research and its results were generally unclassified and published in the normal manner by those researchers.
 
   >In only three instances was research performed in a manner which would raise questions regarding its ethical/moral propriety. The questionable subprojects involved the use of individuals who were not aware that they were the subjects of a research program or that they were being given a drug. This unwitting testing generally took place in social situations among friends and acquaintances of the researcher. In 1963, after questions were raised within the Agency by the Inspector General about the propriety of these subprojects, they were discontinued.
 
   >Between 1963 and 1967 some testing of drugs continued, but only on voluntary subjects. In 1967 all projects involving behavior influencing drugs were terminated." <sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4328740/CIA-RDP86M00886R000800010039-4.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1955 to 1975, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted 50 classified medical studies at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland. The purpose was to evaluate the impact of low-dose chemical warfare agents on military personnel and to test protective clothing and pharmaceuticals. About 7,000 soldiers fully consented and took part in these experiments that involved exposures to more than 250 different chemicals. The National Academies of Science (NAS) reviewed the potential for long-term health effects from these experiments and did not find any significant long-term physical harm, except for some Veterans exposed to larger doses of mustard agents. NAS published these studies under the title of, "Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents," in three volumes dated 1982, 1984 and 1985. A follow-up 2004 study and a 2016 study found, "no significant effects had been observed in the health of test subjects in the years since the tests occurred." No deaths have been attributed to the studies.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426012639/https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Chemical-and-Biological-Exposures)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp)</sup></sup>

  - From 1954-1973, the U.S. Army ran Operation Whitecoat. The purpose was to study the defense of bioweapons at Fort Detrick.
    Volunteering for Operation Whitecoat basically resulted in the Service member assignment to Fort Detrick. Assignment to Fort Detrick did not mean that the volunteer automatically participated in human experimentation. There was a distinct process used for each experiment.

    Each medical investigator prepared a protocol that was extensively reviewed and modified to comply with the twelve ethical principles of the Nuremberg Code. (The Nuremberg war crimes trials convicted 23 Nazi doctors of murder. In 1946, Andrew Ivey released his list of ten conditions required for "permissible medical experiments" in healthy subjects, which became known as the Nuremberg Code. These twelve conditions are embodied in the Wilson Memorandum described above.) When a review validated the ethical requirement and scientific validity of an experiment, it was forwarded to Army officials for approval.

    It was at this point that potential volunteers were briefed as a group on the approved protocol. During this briefing, they became familiar with the purpose of the study and the risks and benefits involved. They also attended an interview with a scientist where they could ask questions about the research. Volunteers were encouraged to discuss the study with family members, clergy and personal physicians. After an obligatory waiting period of 24 hours to four weeks (the length depended on the presumed risks of the study), informed consent documents would be signed.

    It must be stressed that Operation Whitecoat soldiers were not required to participate in any study, only to be present for the protocol briefings by principal investigators seeking volunteers. About 20 percent of Operation
Whitecoat volunteers did not participate in any study during their tenure at Fort Detrick.
   
    Further, there has been no documented long-term negative effects or deaths.<sup>[1](https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Frequently-Asked-Questions/Human-Subject-Research-at-Fort-Detrick)</sup></sup>


- In 1942, after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbour, the US evacuated, from the West Coast, individuals of Japanese descent to temporary assembly centers. This was based on, at the time, military necessity as intelligence was indicating the existence of hundreds of Japanese organizations in California, Washington, Oregon and Arizona which, prior to December 7, 1941, were actively engaged in advancing Japanese war aims. These records also disclosed that thousands of American-born Japanese had gone to Japan to receive their education and indoctrination there and had become pro-Japanese and then had returned to the United States. That's the context for this decision. It has been rightly criticised if going to such lengths were indeed militarily necessary. However, a number of myths persist to this day, to suggest the US lacked care for Japanese people during planning, evacuation and at the new locations. This couldn't be further from the truth. Operations were designed to mitigate impact to their lives—such as [sustainment and protection](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=16&skin=2021&size=125) of property, farmland and more. [Exceptional, adequate medical and sanitation care](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=223&skin=2021) was provided during transfer, and at relocation facilities. It's also worth noting that citizens with heritage from Axis nations were also considered, such as German. Of course, Japanese citizens also joined the US military to join the war effort to fight the Japanese imperialism. Their bravery and value were well noted and documented at the time, and still to this day, even during internment.<sup>[1](https://history.army.mil/html/books/nisei_linguists/CMH_70-99-1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://history.army.mil/armyhistory/AH59newOCR.pdf)</sup></sup> There is a wealth of academic scholarship on the decision to evacuate.<sup>[3](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112041523397&view=2up&seq=1&skin=2021)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the CIA, from 1948 onwards, had an operation called, "mockingbird" as an operation to manipulate media domestically. This is a hoax. As confirmed in the CIA's '[Family Jewels](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101104822/https://www.cia.gov/open/Family%20Jewels.pdf)', all Mockingbird was, was a wiretap on two journalists for a few months as they were suspected of making public some classified information. "During the period from 12 March 1963 to 15 June 1963, this office installed telephone taps on two Washington-based newsmen who were suspected of disclosing classified information..." This activity was also [lawful](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj) at the time, and would be today.

- The Tuskegee experiment,1932. This has been subject to a lot of disinformation and popular myth. I'll quote at length from a 2005 Lancet Infectious Diseases [article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(05)01286-7/fulltext) that corrects the distorted record on the episode:

   "More than a quarter of black Americans questioned in a recent survey believe that AIDS was produced in a laboratory, and 16% believe that it was created by the US government to control the black population. In attempting to explain why such mistaken notions are so widely held, Laura Bogart, lead author of the study, says: “Conspiracy beliefs stem from current and historical discrimination against blacks in our health-care system, including the Tuskegee syphilis study”. The Tuskegee study has become the archetype of unethical research and racism in medicine. However, by citing Tuskegee, is Bogart merely invoking one set of conspiracy beliefs to explain another?
 
    Between 1932 and 1972, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) studied 600 black men, 399 with untreated latent syphilis and 201 uninfected controls, living around Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. Although there was no study protocol, the purpose of the Tuskegee experiments seems to have been to observe patients with untreated latent syphilis to autopsy and verify the presence or absence of syphilitic destructive lesions. According to a detailed analysis of the Tuskegee study by Robert M White in Archives of Internal Medicine, USPHS officers believed that the study “should forever dispel the rather general belief that syphilis is a disease of small consequence to the negro”.

    Although often reported in the medical literature, it took a 1972 New York Times article to bring the Tuskegee experiment to widespread public attention, following which the study was ended in November of that year. In 1997, President Clinton made a public apology to the participants in the study.

    Many aspects of the conduct of the Tuskegee study are beyond dispute. The men who took part were not told their diagnosis and were misled into believing they were receiving treatment, when in fact most were never adequately treated, even when penicillin became available. However, a pervasive myth that must be dispelled is that patients were deliberately infected with syphilis. The truth is that the infected men had had syphilis for several years at the time they were recruited.

    It is debatable whether the study was racist. All the patients and controls were black (as was 82% of the population of Macon County in 1930), but this was because the study has its origins in earlier work supported by the philanthropic Rosenwald Fund, with the motivation of promoting the welfare of African Americans. Although the Rosenwald Fund decided not to support the Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis, it was endorsed by the Tuskegee Institute—an entirely African-American organisation—and black health-care professionals were involved at all stages of the study. Indeed, as late as 1969, the Macon County Medical Society, consisting mostly of black doctors, agreed to assist the USPHS in continuing the study.

    To describe the Tuskegee study as unethical requires an element of what Richard A Shweder describes as “presentism” (ie, judging past actions on the basis of the standards of today). When the study began, the only treatment for syphilis was the poorly efficacious arsphenamine compounds, and there was no medical consensus on the usefulness of these drugs in latent syphilis. And debate over whether treatment of latent syphilis did more harm than good continued into the early 1950s, well into the era of penicillin availability.

    We should also bear in mind that in the 1930s there were no written standards for experimentation with human beings, and the paternalistic attitude that pervaded medical practice at the time meant that the norms for informing patients about their illness were very different from now. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that a hypothetical institutional review board of the 1930s would have judged the Tuskegee study unethical at its inception. However, principles for research with human beings were adopted by the American Medical Association in 1946, and by the 1950s programmes for penicillin treatment of syphilis were widespread across the USA. Thus, by its 20th anniversary the Tuskegee study had become unethical by the standards of the time—patients should have been informed of their diagnosis and given the option of treatment.

    To use the “Tuskegee effect” to explain the disengagement by many black Americans with the reality of AIDS is perhaps understandable, given the way the study has been popularly interpreted. However, focus-group research shows that the public is able to weigh current concerns against worries about the Tuskegee study. The Tuskegee experiment deserves re-examination, free of our contemporary prejudices, before it is again deployed as a symbol of conspiracy."
    
- In 1942, the US determined that biological attacks from Japan and Germany were possible. The US Federal Government worked with local authorities and academia to develop defensive measures and study vulnerability to such attack. Known as Operation Sea Spray, the Army used simulants such as fluorescent particles and non-infectious SM and BG. Pundits falsely claim that the US released biological weapons to do testing, as shown, that wasn't the case.<sup>[1](https://ia800104.us.archive.org/18/items/U.SArmyActivityInTheU.S.BiologicalWarfarePrograms/RNCBW_USABWP.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.nap.edu/read/5739/chapter/12#117)</sup></sup>
