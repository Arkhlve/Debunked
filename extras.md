- The EITs used by the Agency were highly effective, thwarting a number of planned AQ attacks, contrary to the discredited SSCI majority report's allegation. The following are examples of such:

  "The Study makes a number of claims related to the accuracy of the information provided by the CIA about Abu Zubaydah to OLC. First, the Study asserts that the OLC "relied on inaccurate CIA representations about Abu Zubaydah's status in al-Qa'ida and the interrogation team's 'certain|y' that Abu Zubaydah was withholding information about planned terrorist attacks." We found that the information relied upon by the Study to criticize the CIA's representations about Abu Zubaydah withholding information about planned terrorists attacks neglected to include important statements from within that same intelligence cable, which supported those representations by the CIA. Specifically, the Study cites an email from the CIA's interrogation team that included the sentence: "our assumption is the objective of this operation [the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah] is to achieve a high degree of confidence that [Abu Zubaydah] is not holding back actionable information concerning threats to the United States beyond that which [Abu Zubaydah] has already provided." However, this carefully chosen text omits critical statements from later in the same cable: "[t]here is information and analysis to indicate that subject has information on terrorist threats to the United States" and "he is an incredibly strong willed individual which is why he has resisted this long." Second, the Study asserts the CIA assessment that Abu Zubaydah was the "third or fourth man" in al-Qa'ida was "based on single-source reporting that was recanted prior to the August 1, 2002, OLC memorandum." The CIA was in possession of multiple threads of intelligence supporting Abu Zubaydah's prominent role in al-Qa' ida. However, the level of detail that had previously provided about Abu Zubaydah undermined his later attempts to retract his earlier admissions about his involvement in future terrorist attacks [redacted] and his denials about meeting with Abu Zubaydah. Moreover, Abu Zubaydah himself admitted to at least one meeting with [redacted] which undermines [redacted] denials about such meetings. Third, the Study incredibly claims that "[The CIA later concluded that Abu Zubaydah was not a member of al-Qa'ida." We found that the one document cited by the Study did not support this unbelievable and factually incorrect assertion. Specifically, a text box in this cited intelligence product makes the following assertions: A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-qa'ida. Pre-911 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a "senior al-Qa' ida lieutenant," which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama Bin Ladin  Al-Qa' ida rejected Abu Zubaydah's request in 1993 to join the group and that Khaldan was not overseen by Bin Ladin's organization.  The Study fails to state that the interrogation of this supposed "non-member" resulted in 766 sole-source disseminated intelligence reports by the Study's own count. Ironically, this intelligence product was written based on information from detainees and captured documents"—including from Abu Zubaydah.

  The Thwarting of the Dirty Bomb/Tall Buildings Plot and the Capture of Jose Padilla. "CIA records clearly indicate that sleep deprivation played a significant role in Abu Zubaydah's identification of Jose Padilla as an al-Qa'ida operative tasked to carry out an attack against the United States. Abu Zubaydah provided this information to FBI agents during an interrogation session that began late at night on April 20, 2002, and ended on April 21, 2002. Between April 15,2002 and April 21, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was deprived of sleep for a total of 126.5 hours (5.27 days) over a 136 hour (5.6 day) period—while only being permitted several brief sleep breaks between April 19, 2002 and April 21, 2002, which totaled 9.5 hours. This particular Study claim gives the false impression that enhanced interrogation techniques played no role in obtaining important threat information about Jose Padilla during the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah on April 20-21, 2002, and implies that such information was really just the result of the "rapport-building" techniques used by the FBI agents that evening. The CIA documentary record is clear that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to an extended period of sleep deprivation and other enhanced interrogation techniques during his interrogation between April 15, 2002 and April 21, 2002. Specifically, during this time period when FBI agents and CIA officers were working together in rotating, round-the-clock shifts, some of the interrogation techniques used on Abu Zubaydah included nudity,136 liquid diet, sensory deprivation, and extended sleep deprivation. The sleep deprivation of Abu Zubaydah began on April 15, 2002. By April 19, 2002, Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to 76 straight hours of sleep deprivation in the form of intensive interrogation sessions and his ability to focus on questions and provide coherent answers appeared to be compromised to a point where sleep was required. Abu Zubaydah was allowed three hours of sleep at that time. On April 20, 2002, the FBI began its late-night interrogation shift at approximately 10:30 p.m. with Abu Zubaydah and continued until about 7:00 a.m. the next morning. During that shift, Abu Zubaydah was given a two-hour sleep break; time for prayer, food, and water; and a medical check-up. By April 21, 2002, the day he identified Jose Padilla as a terrorist inside the United States, CIA records indicate that Abu Zubaydah had only been permitted several brief sleep breaks between April 19, 2002 and April 21, 2002, which only totaled 9.5 hours of sleep over a 136-hour period. That means Abu Zubaydah had been sleep deprived for a total of 126.5 hours (5.27 days) over a 136-hour (5.6 day) period by the time his FBI interrogators were finished with him at the end of that shift. A CIA chart, not included in the Study, which describes both the standard and enhanced techniques used on Abu Zubaydah, notes for April 21, 2002, "two sessions; sleep deprivation (136 hours)" under the heading "enhanced techniques " Moreover, the FBI interrogator, identified in the press as, who was questioning Zubaydah at the time he provided the Padilla information, told the OIG that "during the CIA interrogations Zubaydah 'gave up' Jose Padilla and identified several targets for future al-Qaeda attacks." In other words, while Special Agent obtained the information on Padilla, it was during a period that the FBI and CIA officers were using the CIA's techniques. 

  When the CIA and FBI interrogators entered the room late on the night of April 20, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was totally naked. He had been subjected to at least four days of dietary manipulation and had been deprived of 126.5 hours of sleep during the past 136 hours. According to FBI Special Agent Ali Soufan, they gave him a towel. They took some Coke and tea into the room and "started talking about different things." Sometime during the next morning, Abu Zubaydah "came back to his senses and he started cooperating again. And this is when he gave us Padilla." Rather than concede that Abu Zubaydah was being subjected to a combination of at least three enhanced interrogation techniques while the FBI agents were using an additional rapport-building technique, the Study includes this perplexing footnote text: While Abu Zubaydah was subjected to nudity and limited sleep deprivation prior to this date by the CIA, he had been allowed to sleep prior to being questioned by the FBI officers, who were exclusively using rapport-building interrogation techniques when the information was acquired." Like the claim in this case study, this footnote is simply at odds with what really happened. There is no reasonable way to reconcile these facts with the claim that enhanced interrogation techniques played "no role" in Abu Zubaydah's identification of Jose Padilla. Sleep deprivation for 126.5 hours over a 136-hour period-which was hardly "limited" —was an enhanced interrogation technique regardless of whether the Department of Justice formally labeled it as such a couple of months later. The Study cannot dismiss the use of these enhanced interrogation techniques simply because they were used before the Department of Justice eventually approved them. The Study's assertion that the FBI was "exclusively" using rapport-building techniques fails to recognize the reality that this interrogation technique was used in combination with at least three other enhanced interrogation techniques. In judging what caused Abu Zubaydah to give up valuable intelligence, including information on Jose Padilla, it is impossible to separate or disaggregate enhanced interrogation techniques from rapport-building techniques after enhanced techniques are applied. Enhanced interrogation techniques are designed to compel detainees to cooperate with questioning and are used in conjunction with traditional questioning methods or interrogation techniques. The simple fact is that Abu Zubaydah gave up Padilla during that interrogation, after being subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. It is simply not factually accurate for the Study to claim that Abu Zubaydah gave up the information on Padilla before he was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Nor is it factually accurate to claim that enhanced interrogation techniques played no role in identifying Padilla as a terrorist threat. The direct refutation of this Study claim illustrates the Study's flawed analytical methodology. As we detail in many of the case studies below, Zubaydah provided much of the key initial information that caused the Intelligence Community to recognize the significance of certain events, future threats, terrorist networks, and even potential assets. The Study repeatedly and incorrectly alleges that the FBI obtained this information prior to the application of CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. As a result, this mistaken allegation is taken as a settled premise in the Study's analysis of other case studies and related issues, which has the practical effect of undermining the Study's analyses of those matters. 

  Under its flawed methodology, the Study was able to disregard the significance of the large amount of information provided by Abu Zubaydah between April 15, 2002 and August 4, 2002, by incorrectly categorizing it as not being obtained from the use enhanced interrogation techniques. We now know that all of the information obtained from Abu Zubaydah on and after April 15, 2002, was provided after he had been subjected to enhanced interrogation. The practical result of this fact is that information obtained from Abu Zubaydah after April 15, 2002, can no longer be disregarded by the Study and must be factored into the assessment of the executive branch's effectiveness claims concerning the enhanced interrogation techniques along with the significant amount of important information obtained from Zubaydah following his second period of enhanced interrogation, which began on August 4, 2002. Given the breadth of the information provided by Abu Zubaydah after April 15, 2002, and its attendant impact on subsequent intelligence efforts by the United States government and its allies, we conclude that this information supports the CIA's specific representations about the effectiveness of its Detention and Interrogation Program, including the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, in relation to the thwarting of the Dirty Bomb/Tall Buildings plot and the capture of Jose Padilla.

  The Capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. "CIA records demonstrate that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques during two separate periods in April 2002 and August 2002. During these timeframes, Abu Zubaydah made several photographic identifications of Ramzi bin al-Shibh and provided information that bin al-Shibh had been in Kandahar at the end of 2001, but was then working with KSM in Karachi, Pakistan. More important, Abu Zubaydah provided information about how he would go about locating Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa'ida associates in Karachi. This information caused Pakistani authorities to intensify their efforts and helped lead them to capture Ramzi bin al-Shibh and other al-Qa'ida associates during the Karachi safe house raids conducted on September 10-11, 2002. On April 18, 2002, during Abu Zubaydah's first period of enhanced interrogation, an FBI interrogator showed him a photograph of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. According to the FBI, Abu Zubaydah said that he knew the man in the photograph as "Ramzi bin al-Shiba" and that he had seen him with a group of Arabs shortly after a missile strike in Kandahar, Afghanistan, on the house of Taib Agha, Mullah Omar's secretary. This information appears to place bin al-Shibh in Kandahar in the November 2001 timeframe, roughly five months prior to this interview with Abu Zubaydah. On June 2, 2002, the FBI again showed Abu Zubaydah a photograph of bin al-Shibh. This time Abu Zubaydah provided some additional information, stating that he knew this man as "Al-Sheeba," whom he saw with KSM in Kandahar around December 2001, near the end of Ramadan. He also noted that al-Shibh speaks Arabic like a Yemeni and that he had seen al-Shibh in the media after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On August 21, 2002, during his second period of enhanced interrogation, Abu Zubaydah "immediately recognized the photograph of Ramzi bin al Shibh" Abu Zubaydah mentioned that he had heard "that al-Shibh had stayed at the secret guest house in Qandahar that Mukhtar had established for the pilots and others destined to be involved in the 9/11 attacks." The Study's claim that it found "no connection" between Abu Zubaydah's reporting and Ramzi bin al-Shibh's capture is the result of poor analysis. On August 20, 2002, during his second period of enhanced interrogation, when asked how he would find his former al-Qa'ida associates if he were set free, Abu Zubaydah told CIA interrogators that he would contact the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, who could put him in touch with Hassan Ghul and other senior al-Qa' ida members. 5S The Study frames this interchange much more narrowly. It asserts that "Abu Zubaydah was asked specifically how he would find Hassan Ghul. In response, Abu Zubaydah provided corroborative reporting: that Hassan Ghul could possibly be located through a well-known associate. "This narrow framing of the question and response enables the Study to conclude incorrectly that the capture of bin al-Shibh was an "unexpected" result of the raids that failed to capture Hassan Ghul. The Study's approach fails to understand the causal link between Abu Zubaydah's information and the successful Karachi safe house raids of September 11, 2002, which resulted in the collection of important intelligence information and the capture of 11 al-Qa'ida associates, including Ramzi bin al-Shibh. About six weeks before Abu Zubaydah identified the significancef the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, Pakistani authorities [redacted] raided the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul's home [redacted] in early July 2002. The well-known associate of Hassan Ghul was interviewed on the spot and cooperated with Pakistani authorities [redacted] The well-known associate of Hassan Ghul even sent [redacted] with the Pakistani officers to identify a home where Hassan Ghul formerly resided. The CIA officers observed that the location was "extremely close to (if not an exact match)" to a location where KSM once resided, according to a June 18, 2002, report from the FBI. 

  The Study dismisses Abu Zubaydah's identification of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul as mere "corroborative reporting," and does not attach the appropriate significance to this information because of its rigid adherence to its flawed analytical methodology, which presumes that anything corroborative cannot be considered as "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence." The facts tell a different story. Abu Zubaydah was a recognized senior member of al-Qa'ida who had direct ties to multiple high-ranking terrorists, including Usama Bin Ladin. The CIA was focused on Hassan Ghul, another well-connected senior member of al-Qa' ida, and "other" al-Qa' ida associates of Abu Zubaydah. Therefore, Abu Zubaydah's disclosures were deemed by the CIA as significant and actionable intelligence. When Abu Zubaydah identified the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul as the first person he would contact to reconnect with Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa'ida associates, it is very likely that collecting additional intelligence from the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul became a top operational priority for U.S. and Pakistani officials. It is not surprising that CIA Headquarters on August 29, 2002 reported that Pakistani officials had re-interviewed the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul an unknown number of times and that these officials noted that at times the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul contradicted himself. On September 9, 2002, Pakistani officials returned to the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul's home and interviewed another well-known associate of Hassan Ghul who had recently returned to The other well-known associate of Hassan Ghul cooperated and disclosed the location of Hassan Ghul's apartment, which was promptly raided but found to be empty. Pakistani authorities interviewed and learned that while Hassan Ghul had vacated the apartment, he was scheduled to return to the complex The Pakistani authorities subsequently placed the complex under surveillance in an effort to capture Hassan Ghul. On September 10, 2002, Pakistani authorities arrested two individuals believed to be Hassan Ghul and his driver outside of the apartment complex. These individuals turned out to be Muhammad Ahmad Ghulam Rabbani, a.k.a. Abu Badr and Muhammad Madni, Abu Badr's driver.  Information obtained from Madni led to a series of raids on Scptember 11, 2002, by Pakistani authorities of the identified safe house, resulting in the arrest of 11 individuals, including Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Abdul Rahim Gulam Rabbani, Hassan Muhammad Ali bin Attash, and other al-Qa' ida members. These raids also resulted in the collection of important al-Qaida operational documents, including financial records and the coded "perfume letter."

  The Study's claims with respect to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh do not hold up under a close examination of the CIA documentary record. There was a direct causal connection between the information provided by Abu Zubaydah during his second period of enhanced interrogation and bin al-Shibh's capture. Abu Zubaydah had informed his interrogators that bin al-Shibh was one of KSM's operatives in Karachi. Zubaydah confirmed the importance the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul to locate Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa' ida associates operating in Karachi, including bin al-Shibh. Since the Study's claims on this topic do not hold up to factual scrutiny, its criticisms of the CIA representations with respect to Ramzi bin al-Shibh and President Bush's references to bin al-Shibh in his September 6, 2006, speech on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program are not valid. The CIA said Abu Zubaydah's "knowledge of al-Qa'ida lower-level facilitators, modus operandi and safehouses ... played a key role in the ultimate capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh " Far from a "misrepresentation." that statement was completely accurate and consistent with the circumstances that led to bin al-Shibh's ultimate capture. Similarly, the text in President Bush's September 6, 2006, speech on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program noting that "the information Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of Binalshibh" was also accurate.' The capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh and the other al-Qa'ida terrorists during raids of September 10-11, 2002, were stunning operational successes, made possible, in part, by the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

  The Capture of Khalid Shaykh Mohammad. "Information obtained from CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah was essential to furthering the CIA's understanding of KSM's role in the September 11,2001, terrorist attacks and helped lead to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Interrogations of bin al-Shibh and DETAINEE R provided key insights about KSM. Information produced through detainee interrogation was pivotal to the retention of a key CIA asset whose cooperation led directly to the capture of KSM. The Study almost exclusively attributes the capture of KSM to a "unilateral ClA asset." We agree with the Study that this asset provided information that was crucial to KSM's capture in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on March 1, 2003. We also acknowledge that the CIA had met with the asset as early as fall 2001 and that the asset had provided good intelligence information related to KSM. However, the Study fails to acknowledge the cascading sequence of revelations that began with Abu Zubaydah's identification of the importance of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul and culminated in the information provided by the asset which led directly to the capture of KSM. Moreover, the Study does not recognize that, but for the fortuitous intervention of a CIA officer-who was aware of recently obtained detainee information which corroborated the asset's claims concerning KSM the asset would have been terminated as a CIA source prior to providing the crucial pre-capture information about KSM. 

  The Disruption of the Karachi Hotels Bombing Plot. "CIA documents show that key intelligence collected through the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, including information obtained after the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, played a major role in disrupting the Karachi hotels bombing plot. Our analysis will demonstrate that the intelligence collected through the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, including information obtained after the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, played a key role in the disruption of the Karachi hotels bombing plot. The Study notes that the CIA had information regarding the Karachi terrorist plotting as early as September 11, 2002, in the form of the "perfume letter," which was obtained during a raid of a safe house in Karachi, Pakistan. What the Study fails to point out, however, is that Abu Zubaydah provided crucial information which played a big role in leading to the i raids of the al-Qa'ida safe houses on September 11, 2002 — the same raids that yielded the "perfume letter" and disrupted the Karachi hotels plot. Specifically, Pakistani raids were the direct result of information provided by Abu Zubaydah on August 20, 2002, during his second period of enhanced interrogation. When asked how he would go about finding his former al-Qa'ida associates if he were set free, Abu Zubaydah told CIA interrogators that he would contact a well-known associate of Hassan Ghul who could put him in touch with Ghul and other senior al-Qa'ida members. CIA officers then asked Pakistani officials to question the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, who on September 7, 2002, provided vague information the Pakistanis assessed was untruthful. The Pakistanis continued to watch the residence and, when another well-known associate of Hassan Ghul returned to the residence, questioned the other well-known associate of Hassan Ghul as well. The other well-known associate of Hassan Ghul cooperated and provided the location of Ghul's last apartment. This information led to the arrest, on September 9, 2002, of an individual thought to be Ghul, but who turned out to be another al-Qa'ida terrorist. Abu Zubaydah then positively identified this terrorist as Abu Badr, "KSM's driver and KSM's man in Karachi," facilitating the movement of al-Qa'ida operatives. Badr's driver, who was also arrested, identified information about several al-Qa'ida safehouses and residences in Karachi. Based on this information, on September 11, 2002, [redacted] conducted  raids, which resulted in the arrests of several terrorists and key documents, including one dubbed the "perfume letter" because the word "perfumes" was used as a codeword. In this May 2002 letter, KSM told Hamza Zubayr, a terrorist killed in the same raids, he would provide him with $30,000, with another $20,000 available upon request, and that "we have acquired the green light that is strong for the [hotels]" clearly indicating a plot of some kind." More troubling, the letter suggested "[increasing] the number to make it three instead of one." Were it not for Abu Zubaydah's original information about the significance of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, which led to the Karachi safe house raids, it is unclear if the ''perfume letter" would ever have been found. Abu Zubaydah's value, however, did not end with providing the true significance of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul. Zubaydah subsequently translated the "perfume letter" for the CIA, identified the key word in the letter—"hotels" —that had not been previously translated, and told the CIA that the reference to "Khallad" in the letter may be the "one legged Yemeni." A CIA analyst noted that the one-legged Yemeni was terrorist Khallad bin Attash, who was later arrested and admitted to his involvement in the plot. By early October 2002, the CIA had completed a search of the individuals identified in the "perfume letter" and concluded that most of those who had been assigned roles in support of the hotels operation had been arrested or killed by the Pakistani authorities during the September 11, 2002 raids. Although the Karachi hotels plot had been thwarted by these raids, at least one of the individuals identified by Abu Zubaydah in the letter, Khallad bin Artash, a known al-Qa' ida operative, remained at large.  Eventually, on April 28, 2003, [redacted] was able to capture several al-Qa' ida operatives, including Ammar al-Baluchi and bin Attash. [redacted] also successfully confiscated explosives, detonators, and ammunition as part of the capture operation. On May 17, 2003, Khallad bin Attash confirmed that Ammar al-Baluchi had intended to use the explosives stashed for that operation to target the U.S. Consulate. The next day, [redacted] indicated its clear understanding of how these interrelated Karachi plot events had improved the U.S. security posture in the area when it noted that although its options to enhance security: "we have seen over past months as an increased aggressiveness of local authorities have provided some protection from these threats. We point specifically to the 11 September 2002 raids in Karachi, the 1 March 2003 take-down of KSM, and to the recent arrests of al-Baluchi and ba Attash as examples of how [redacted] have thwarted attacks."

  The Identification of Bin Ladin's Courier. "CIA documents show that detainee information served as the "tip-off" and played a significant role in leading CIA analysts to the courier Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. While there was other information in CIA databases about al-Kuwaiti, this information was not recognized as important by analysts until after detainees provided information on him. In the days immediately after the Bin Ladin raid, CIA analysts and operators testified before the Committee about how they tracked down Bin Ladin. The CIA described the lead information as being provided by detainees in U.S. custody at CIA secret sites and the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and from detainees in the custody of foreign governments that helped the CIA recognize the importance of Bin Ladin's courier, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. CIA officers were clear that the information was from detainees, but never portrayed the information as originating solely from detainees held by the CIA. CIA documents show that even before the raid took place, CIA analysts prepared briefings and papers on their analysis of what led them to the courier. These briefings and papers clearly described the key role that detainee reporting played in this analytical and operational process. A CIA paper in November 2007 noted that "over twenty mid to high-value detainees have discussed Abu Ahmad's ties to senior al-Qa'ida leaders, including his role in delivering messages from Bin Ladin and his close association with former al-Qa'ida third-in-command Abu Faraj al-Libi. The report highlighted specific reporting from two detainees, Hassan Ghul and Ammar al-Baluchi, who both identified Abu Faraj al-Libi's role in communicating to Bin Ladin through Abu Ahmad. It was this and similar reporting from other detainees that helped analysts realize Abu Faraj's categorical denials that he even knew anyone named Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, "almost certainly were an attempt to protect Abu Ahmed," thus showing his importance. Additionally, a retrospective prepared by the CIA's Study for the Center of Intelligence after the raid also made clear in its report that detainee information was significant in the identification of the courier. The report noted that High-Value Terrorist analysts, targeters, and their managers told the Center that: "debriefing al-Qa' ida detainees provided them with unparalleled expertise and knowledge of the organization. The ability to cross-check detainee statements against one another-specifically Abu Faraj's with that of numerous other detainees ultimately led to the assessment that Abu Ahmad was directly serving as Bin Ladin's facilitator and possibly harboring him. In sum, 25 detainees provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, his al-Qa'ida membership, and his historic role as a courier for Bin Ladin. Nine of the 25 were held in non-CIA custody. Of the 16 held in CIA custody, all but three had given information after being subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs), although of the 13 only two (KSM and Abu Zubaydah) had been waterboarded. Even so, KSM gave false information about Abu Ahmad, as did Abu Faraj, who received lesser EITs. Ironically, the falsity of the information was itself important in establishing Abu Ahmad's significance." The Study—benefiting from the ability to search a database compiled of only information relevant to its specific task (something intelligence analysts are not able to do) with the advantage of hindsight to understand which names are now important—asserts that prior to receiving information from CIA detainees, the CIA had other critical reporting on the courier. The Study cites Abu Ahmad's phone number and e-mail address, a body of intelligence reporting linking him to KSM's operational planning, and reporting on Abu Ahmad's age, physical appearance, and family—including information the CIA would later cite as pivotal in identifying his true name.

  While it is true that the CIA was conducting technical intelligence collection linked to Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002, CIA fact-checking confirmed that this information was meaningless because: (1) it did not link Abu Ahmad to Bin Ladin; (2) Abu Ahmad had stopped using the phone number and e-mail address in 2002; and (3) Abu Ahmad was not linked to that email address in any of his subsequent correspondence. According to the CIA, "that intelligence was insufficient to distinguish Abu Ahmad from many other Bin Ladin associates until additional information from detainees put it into context and allowed us to better understand his true role and potential in the hunt for Bin Ladin." Further review of CIA records confirmed that the phone number at issue was an Inmarsat number associated with "Mukhtar" and "Ahmad 'al-Kuwahadi."According to Adam Robinson, the author of Bin Laden Behind the Mask of the Terrorist, "[a]fter a long period of use of the Inmarsat system, Osama learned that this system is open to interception, both for covert observation and possibly for homing in on the signal. After he became aware of this, he used the system only periodically for calling his mother." If this claim about Bin Ladin's belief is accurate and al-Qa'ida leadership believed that phones were vulnerable, it may explain why this particular phone number was abandoned by KSM and Abu Ahmad. The information providing Kuwaiti's physical description and family details was critical to ultimately identifying al-Kuwaiti's true name, but not until years later—2007 to be exact-after detainee reporting provided enough information about the courier that a search of old records illuminated key information in that reporting. The CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence said such information was "an unnoticed needle in the haystack on an unending plain of haystacks" until that time. One of the lead CiA analysts called similar information that later turned out to be important "meaningless" until years later when detainee reporting illuminated its importance. Thus, this information really only became critical to the CIA after detainee reporting provided enough information about the courier that a search of old records illuminated key information in that reporting. 

  Detainees who provided useful and accurate information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and Bin Ladin had undergone enhanced interrogation prior to providing the information. For example, Hassan Ghul provided more specificity about Abu Ahmad after being transferred from COBALT and receiving enhanced interrogation techniques. The Study disputes statements from current and former CIA officials that information from detainees in CIA's enhanced interrogation program provided valuable information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. For example, then-CIA Director Leon Panetta told ABC News in May 2011, soon after the Bin Ladin raid, that enhanced interrogation techniques were used to extract information that led to the mission's success.Former Director Hayden said in an interview that '"the original lead information—and frankly it was incomplete identity information on the couriers—began with information from CIA detainees at the black sites. Both of these statements are accurate. While numerous detainees at CIA black sites provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, as noted above, two detainees, Hassan Ghul and Ammar al-Baluchi, in particular were cited by the lead CIA analyst as leading her to search old intelligence files. Ammar al-Baluchi, who appears to be the first detainee to mention Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti's role as a Bin Ladin courier and a possible connection with Abu Faraj al-Libi, provided this information at a CIA black site during a period of enhanced interrogation."

  CIA continues to assess that Khalid Shaykh Muhammad's (KSM) identification of Pakistani businessman Saifullah Paracha, an al-Qa'ida contact whom KSM was trying to use to smuggle explosives into the United States, was a success resulting from detainee reporting. KSM's information spurred FBI action against Paracha; prompted FBI to question his son, Uzhair; and allowed analysts to focus on the right Saifullah Paracha. Reporting from interrogations of KSM was directly and uniquely responsible for the arrests of Saifullah Paracha and his son Uzhair Paracha, both of whom KSM claimed had agreed to facilitate an al-Qa/ida plan to smuggle explosives into the United States. 198 In a 26 March 2003 cable, the FBI stated that it had taken action with regard to Saifullah and Uzhair based on KSM's debriefing disseminated 25 March. he FBI immediately watchlisted Saifullah and Uzhair and searched domestic immigration and law enforcement databases for details on their locations and activities. The FBI determined Saifullah was located in Pakistan but was able to arrest Uzhair in New York on 31 March. The StudyJs finding that CIA possessed sufficient information to identify and detain Saifullah Paracha without reporting from KSM is incorrect. We had fragmentary information suggesting that someone by the name of Saifullah Paracha might be of interest to us as a possible accomplice in an al-Qa/ida overseas financial scheme. However, we did not know which among the many people who have that name around the world to focus upon. We did not know he was involved in a potential attack on the US until KSM told us Saifullah and his son agreed to smuggle explosives into the US. The FBI found the son in New York, in their words, "based on this reporting."

  The Study says that Saifullah Paracha was already Uwell-known to the IC prior to the capture of KSM" but the only clear link the Study cites between Paracha and terrorist plotting is actually a reference to a different Saifullah Paracha.  All other references are either too vague or indirect to have been meaningful without detainee reporting, refer to a nascent investigation of terrorist use of a Paracha-affiliated business to mask financial transfers, or in many cases, also refer to a different Saifullah Paracha. The Study refers to a Saifullah Paracha who had links to Mir Aimal Kansi, the terrorist who killed two people outside CIA Headquarters in 1993. However, the Saifullah Paracha KSM reported on was more than 25 years younger and not connected to Mir Aimal Kansi. The Study cites a ulink" between Paracha and Abu Zubaydah, because Paracha's name appeared among hundreds of other names in documents confiscated in the Abu Zubaydah raid. While the CIA passed Paracha's name and information on his ties to a Karachi, Pakistan-based company with a New York office to the FBI, the Bureau did not report any further information of Interest concerning Paracha until after KSM's debriefing. The Study cites two other pieces of information on Paracha that it claims are representative of reporting available independent of the CIA detention and interrogation program. Neither report was noteworthy without KSM's information. One is an indirect connection to Paracha's business in Pakistan that Committee staff found in an undisseminated FBI case file. It was not available to CIA at the time and would not have linked Paracha to an al-Qaida operation independent of KSM's information in any case. The other report is [redacted] of Majid Khan before he was rendered [redacted] to US custody, but the report included few details and was disseminated just after KSM provided the information that allowed us to identify Paracha.

  CIA continues to assess that information from detainees in CIA custody-specifically Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM) and Abu Zubaydah-that was obtained after they were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques was important to identifying Ja'far al-Tayyar. The "key contextual facts" that the Study claims CIA omitted are incorrect: "The Intelligence Community was interested in the Florida-based Adnan al-Shukrijumah prior to the detention of the CIA Js first detainee." The only reference to Shukrijumah in CIA holdings prior to 2003 was a request for traces from FBI and a CIA response that stated, "A search of our Agency's records found no identifiable information on  Adnan Gulshair el-Shukri Jumah To support its claim, the Study cites a US District Court case file-which was not in CIA databases-that mentions Shukrijumah due to his association with a Florida-based extremist. Abu Zubaydah's information in May 2002 came after being subjected to sleep deprivation. Although sleep deprivation was not officially designated an enhanced technique in 2002, it was classified as such in 2005. This information was an initial step toward identifying the right Ja'far al-Tayyar, but we were not able to do so until KSM provided more detailed reporting. The Study implies that CIA had substantial information on Ja'far al-Tayyar by noting that we produced "a targeting study" on him in January 2003, prior to KSM's detention. However, that study was titled, "Targeting Study: Finding the Right Ja'far al-Tayyar,,,226 and the first paragraph stated, "Unfortunately, many extremists use the name of Ja'far al-Tayyar, which can be translated as 'Jafar the Pilot.' Headquarters research has identified several distinct Ja'far al-Tayyars. We very much want to confirm the locations of each of these Jafars."

  The Heathrow and Canary Wharf Plots. The CIA interrogation program played a key role in disrupting the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plotting. Despite its claim that information acquired during or after the use of enhanced interrogation techniques played "no role" in the disruption of the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plots, the Study twice concedes these plots were "fully disrupted" with the detentions of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, KSM, Ammar al-Baluchi, and Khallad bin Attash. The Study then incorrectly asserts that "It]here are no CIA records to indicate that any of the detainees was captured as a result of CIA detainee reporting."As we have previously demonstrated, information obtained from the CIA interrogation program played a key role in the capture of al-Shibh and KSM.222 Also, Ramzi bin al-Shibh provided information about Ammar al-Baluchi and Abu Zubaydah provided information about Khallad bin Attash prior to their arrests. The same detainee information that helped lead to the capture of these terrorists also played a key role in fully disrupting the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plots. Thus far, the following analytical dominoes have fallen in relation to the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plots: (1) "There is considerable evidence that the information Abu Zubaydah provided identifying KSM as "Mukhtar" and the mastermind of 9/11 was significant to CIA analysts, operators, and FBI interrogators"; (2) "Abu Zubaydah provided information about how he would go about locating Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa'ida associates in Karachi. This information caused [redacted] Pakistani authorities to intensify their efforts and helped lead them to capture Ramzi bin al-Shibh and other al-Qa' ida associates during the Karachi safe house raids conducted on September 10-11, 2002,225 (3) "Information produced through detainee interrogation was pivotal to the retention of a key CIA asset whose cooperation led directly to the capture of KSM":226 (4) Zubaydah told the CIA that the reference to "Khallad" in the letter may be the "one legged Yemeni".227 and (5) Pakistan's arrest of al-Qa'ida terrorists Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad Bin Attash disrupted the al-Qa'ida plot to attack the U.S. Consulate in Karachi.228 Taken together, these significant operational accomplishments, most of them resulting from information obtained from CIA detainees, also had the added bonus of disrupting the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plots.

  The Study undercuts its own argument that the CIA interrogation program played no role in the disruption of the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plotting almost immediately after its narrative on the plots begins. The Study says "records indicate the Heathrow Airport plotting had not progressed beyond the initial planning stages when the operation was fully disrupted with the detention of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (detained on September 11, 2002), KSM (detained on March 1, 2003), Ammar al-Baluchi (detained on April 29, 2003), and Khallad bin Attash (detained on April 29, 2003)."229 As we explained previously, Ramzi bin al-Shibh was detained as a result of information provided by Abu Zubaydah during a period of enhanced interrogation.230 By asserting that the detention of Ramzi bin al-Shibh played a role in the disruption of the plot, certainly the detainee information that led to his detention also played a role in the plot's disruption.

  The Thwarting of the Second Wave Plots and Discovery of the Al-Ghuraba Group. The CIA interrogation program played a key role in disrupting the "Second Wave" plot and led to the capture of the 17-member al-Ghuraba group. The Study asserts that because Hambali's brother, Gun Gun Ruswan Gunawan, first identified a group of 17 Malaysian and Indonesian Jemaah Islamiya (JI) affiliated students in Karachi, "the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Hambali did not result in the 'discovery' of "the Ghuraba Cell' that was 'tasked with executing the 'Second Wave' plotting."264 While Gunawan did identify the group of JI students in Karachi, the Study ignores that KSM; who had also been subjected to the ClA's enhanced interrogation techniques, provided information months earlier on this same group of JI students and their location in Karachi —information that had helped lead to the capture of Gunawan himself. The Study also ignores information provided by other detainees in CIA's interrogation program. In April 2003, KSM provided information about Gunawan's role in Karachi as a communications conduit between Hambali and al-Qa'ida and reported that he was living in the dormitory where he was enrolled at Abu Bakr-Sadeeq University. KSM also drew a map with the location of a house he called "Colony Gate" where he met Gunawan, where he said a group of JI students would meet.266 According to CIA information, while the CIA was already aware of Gunawan, "KSM's identification of his role as Hambali's potential successor prioritized his capture. Information from multiple detainees, including KSM, narrowed down [Gunawan's] location and enabled his capture in September 2003." This information was excluded from the Study. Hambali provided very similar information after his capture in August 2003. On August 20, 2003, CIA headquarters provided information on Gunawan [redacted] "which solidly ties Rusman Gunawan to al-Qa'ida and al-Qa' ida's terrorist attacks" [redacted] The information provided was largely from interrogations of KSM, including information about Gunawan working as a communications conduit for Hambali and al-Qa'ida, his location in Karachi, a description of Gunawan, but also provided information from another detainee in CIA custody, Ammar al-Baluchi. Gunawan was arrested on [redacted] at the Abu Bakr Madrassa, locational information first provided by KSM, along with most of JI student group. After Gunawan's arrest he was caught trying to send a coded message which he admitted was intended to warn the group of Jl-affiliated students about his arrest. [redacted] participating in the interrogation recognized Gunawan's information about this group of mostly Malaysian students as similar to intelligence reporting provided previously by KSM that he was planning to recruit Malaysians in a "next wave of attacks." The officers asked that Hambali be questioned about the reporting.

  During a ClA interrogation of Hambali days later, Hambali, now in ClA custody and undergoing enhanced interrogation, provided more information about the group, identifying them as the "al-Ghuraba" group and describing how they were set up by Hambali and sent to Karachi because of its "proximity to Afghanistan and the availability of military-style training facilities there." He said the Program was designed to "give a select few the opportunity for military-style training to prepare them for jihad" and identified two who were ready for operations.276 Hambali provided information about the identities and backgrounds of several of the al-Ghuraba group members and described conversations he had with KSM about possible future attacks on the United States. In a subsequent interrogation, Hambali said the group was not yet ready for operations, but may be in 2003-2004 (it was already late 2003 when he provided this information) and he named individuals who were being groomed as suicide and other operatives. [redacted] arrested the members of the al-Ghuraba group during raids on [redacted] A cable describing the arrests said, "[We] captured this cell based on the debriefings of captured senior al-Qa'ida operatives, who stated that some members of this cell were to be part of senior al-Qal'lida leader Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM)['s] second wave operation to attack the United States using the same modus operandi as was used in the September 11, 2001 attacks."

  In a seeming effort to suggest CIA's assessment of the threat posed by the al-Ghuraba group had diminished over time, the Study identified an October 27, 2006, CIA cable that stated, "All of the members of the former al-Ghuraba cell have now been released.It also cited an April 18, 2008, CIA intelligence report focusing on the Jemaah Islamiya and referencing the al-Ghuraba group that makes no reference to the group serving as potential operatives for KSM's 'Second Wave' plotting." These statements are misleading in several ways. The April 18, 2008 intelligence report was about Jemaah Islamiya in Pakistan, not the al-Ghuraba group, and provided only a minor description of the "al-Ghuraba cell in Karachi," but did mention that its leader was in direct contact with Hambali and "al-Qa'ida external operations chief Khalid Shaykh Muhammad." The Study omitted a report focused on Jemaah Fslamiya's al-Ghuraba group published five months later diat said "members of the cell had also been identified by Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, the mastermind of the attacks of 11 September 2001, and senior al-Qa ida and Jl operative Hambali as candidates for post-11 September attacks against the U.S. Homeland," including for "second wave suicide hijacking operations in the Unites States and Europe." Far from suggesting the CIA was unconcerned about the al-Ghuraba group, this report devoted 20 pages to describing the threat from its members including their "jihad activities and the caution that "as this group of radicalized militants reconnects and mingles with other young Southeast Asian Muslims, it poses a revived threat to US and Western interests.<sup>[[35]](https://archive.org/details/ssci-minoritystudy)</sup></sup> <sup>[[36]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup> 

#### OLC analysis
- OLC opinions and the law—the OLC opinions on EITs ended up being completely and resoundingly correct—both with international and domestic law. The following will quote on analysis of specific intent, severe pain,  US Judicial Interpretation, and international decisions—debunking the discredited OPR report. DOJ reached similar conclusions:

  A. Specific Intent
Exhibit number one in OPR's catalogue of supposed "errors, omissions, misstatements, and illogical conclusions," F.R. at 159, in the Bybee Memo is that nemorandum's treatment of "specific intent." In examining the elements of "torture" under 18 U.S.C. § 2340A, the Bybee Memo correctly noted that the statute requires that "severe pain and suffering must be inflicted with specific intent," which it interpreted as an intent "to achieve the forbidden act." Bybee Memo at 3. Citing and quoting from the Supreme Court's then-recent decision in Carter 1. United States, 530 U.S. 255 (2000), which examined the distinction between "general" and "specific" intent in the context of the federal bank-robbery statute, the Bybee Memo then explained that Congress's use of "specific intent" in the torture statute meant that the infliction of "severe pain ... must be the defendant's precise objective.". Bybee Memo at 3. By contrast, "[i]f the defendant acted knowing that severe pain or suffering was reasonably likely to result from his actions, but no more, he would have acted only with general intent." Id. at 3-4. Thus, even if a person knows that severe pain will result from his actions, he lacks the requisite specific intent "if causing such harm is not his objective." Id. at 4. The Bybee Memo concluded by noting that "good faith" is recognized as a defense to "specific intent" crimes, but cautioned that, as a practical matter, a jury was unlikely to credit such a defendant lacked a reasonable basis for his beliefs. Id. at 4-5. This analysis does not simply vault the professional-conduct bar, it is manifestly correct. As we told OPR in our response to its Draft Report, two recent cases in the Third Circuit (one of them en banc) have adopted the Bybee Memo's analysis of specific intent. In those cases, the Third Circuit construed the definition of "torture" pursuant to regulations issued by the Department of Justice to implement the Convention Against Torture. Those regulations provide, in accordance with the United States' reservations at the time of ratification, that "[i]n order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering. An act that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and suffering is not torture." 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(5) (emphasis added). In Auguste v. Ridge, 395 F.3d 123 (3d Cir. 2005), a distinguished panel of the Third Circuit (composed of Judge Fuentes, the late Judge Becker and then-Judge Alito) concluded that the phrase "specific intent" has an "ordinary meaning" in American criminal law," and for that reason it must be construed to have that meaning, despite the immigration context in which the torture question had arisen in that case. Id. at 145. Relying, like the Bybee Memo, on Carter, Auguste then discussed the issue as follows: "The specific intent standard is a term of art that is well-known in American jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has explained that in order for an individual to have acted with specific intent, he must expressly intend to achieve the forbidden act." Id. (emphasis added). After quoting at length the same example from Carter that the Bybee Memo quoted, the Court concluded that "to constitute torture, there must be a showing that the actor had the intent to commit the act as well as the intent to achieve ... the infliction of the severe pain and suffering." Id. at 145-46 n.23 (emphasis added). That is precisely the analysis set forth in the Bybee Memo. See Bybee Memo at 4 ("a defendant is guilty of torture only if he acts with the express purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering"). Notwithstanding years of investigation and research, OPR's Draft Report completely failed to mention this case.

  In Pierre v. Attorney General, 528 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 2008) (en banc), another torture case that somehow also had completely escaped OPR's notice in the Draft Report, the Third Circuit sat en banc to consider whether the "specific intent" requirement under the Convention Against Torture is satisfied by a mere showing that an official "knows" that it is "practically certain that [the victim] will suffer severe pain." 528 F.3d at 182-83. By a lopsided vote of 10 to 3, the court answered that question in the negative. As it had in Auguste, the Court again adverted to the ratification history, including the fact that "[both the President and the Senate indicated their understanding" that the Convention "contains a specific intent requirement." Id at 187. That "understanding," the Court noted, "has domestic legal effect." Id. The Court also reaffirmed Auguste's reliance on Carter, as well as Auguste's conclusion that specific intent to torture requires both the intent to do the act and the intent to "achieve the consequences of the act, namely the infliction of the severe pain and suffering" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 189-90 (discussing Carter and noting that "an actor who knowingly commits an act but does not intend the illegal outcome of that act, can only be held liable for a general, not specific, intent crime"). Accordingly, the court concluded, "a petitioner cannot obtain relief under the CAT unless ... [the] prospective torturer will have the goal or purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering." Id. at 190 (emphasis added). The Court addressed the question of a defendant's knowledge as follows: We disagree that proof of knowledge on the part of government officials that severe pain or suffering will be the practically certain result ... satisfies the specific intent requirement of the CAT. Rather, we are persuaded ... that the specific intent requirement ... requires a petitioner to show that his prospective torturer will have the motive or purpose to cause him pain or suffering... Mere knowledge that a result is substantially certain to follow from one's actions is not sufficient to form the specific intent to torture. Knowledge that pain and suffering will be the certain outcome of conduct may be sufficient for a finding of general intent but it is not enough for a finding of specific intent. Id. at 189 (emphasis added).

  It would appear that an understanding similar to the Third Circuit's has prevailed in "[e]very other circuit to consider the question" under the Convention Against Torture. Villegas v. Mukasey, 523 F.3d 984, 988 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing, inter alia, Auguste); see also Pierre v. Gonzales, 502 F.3d 109, 118 (2d Cir. 2007) (noting, in another CAT case, that "the phrase 'specifically intended' incorporates a criminal 'specific intent' standard .... The President and Senate knew full well that they were construing a treaty designed to stop criminal conduct. We cannot ignore the word 'specifically' in the ratification understanding ... and we decline to give it a counter-intuitive spin."). The Bybee Memo therefore correctly interpreted the specific intent requirement of the torture statute-without the benefit of the subsequently developed body of case law addressing intent specifically in the context of torture. Its conclusions have been ratified by every court of appeals to consider the question. OPR nevertheless makes this undisputedly correct analysis the centerpiece of its argument that Professor Yoo committed professional misconduct—a telling barometer of the Final Report's overall strength. OPR's critique, the substance of which appears to be wholly lifted from secondary sources, not only is riddled with errors, but would be equally applicable to the sitting federal judges who have now adopted the Bybee Memo's interpretation of the torture statute.

  First, OPR concludes that the Bybee Memo "failed to note the ambiguity and complexity in this area of the law." F.R. at 160. To support that critique, OPR quotes snippets from decades-old Supreme Court opinions stating that distinctions between "general" and "specific" intent can be "elusive" or "difficult]." F.R. at 169-70 (citing and quoting from United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422 (1978), and United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394 (1980)). Bizarrely, OPR also notes that in Bailey the Court suggested that conventional analyses of intent might be replaced by the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, which would adopt a "hierarchy of culpable states of mind.., commonly identified, in descending order of culpability, as purpose, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence,"' F.R. at 170 (quoting Bailey, 444 U.S. at 403-04) (alteration in original), and quotes Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419 (1985), for the proposition that a "more useful instruction might relate specifically to the mental state required under [the statute in question) and eschew use of difficult legal concepts like 'specific intent' and 'general intent.'' F.R. at 170 (alteration in original). OPR cannot be serious, and if it is, cannot be taken seriously. How could anyone find fault with Professor Yoo's analysis on the theory that he should have "eschew[ed]" the "difficult legal concept" of "specific intent" in favor of the "mental state required" under the torture statute, when "specific intent" is the mental state expressly required by the statute? Analysis of this quality calls into question whether anyone at OPR has read the federal torture statute. No sane client would be interested in learning that the Supreme Court—at least as it was constituted 29 years ago-might have preferred that Congress write its laws using the terminology of the Model Penal Code when Congress, in the particular statute actually at issue, quite obviously did not do so."' Indeed, had Professor Yoo undertaken the analysis that OPR suggests, he might have been justifiably criticized for providing confusing, incompetent, and useless legal advice. The Bybee Memo was not alone in failing to ponder the potential ambiguity in "specific intent"; neither did the Third Circuit opinions in Auguste and Pierre. The en banc Court in Pierre, for example, stated succinctly that [s]pecific intent requires not simply the general intent to accomplish an act with no particular end in mind, but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose of accomplishing a specific and prohibited result." 528 F.3d at 189. Auguste treated the issue as an easy one: "specific intent" is a term of art that has a well-known meaning in American law—and it treated as self-evident the proposition that anyone would know from Carter what that meaning is. Nowhere did these cases or similar others from other circuits discuss the difficulty of interpreting "specific intent"; the en banc Third Circuit even cited Bailey as supporting the point that "'"purpose" corresponds loosely with the common-law concept of specific intent," without noting Bailey's dicta about the "difficulty" of the concept, id. at 190 (quoting Bailey, 444 U.S. at 405). Surely OPR does not mean to suggest that the federal judges writing and joining those decisions, including a current Supreme Court Justice, are guilty of professional misconduct for failing to ruminate on the supposed ambiguity in the phrase "specific intent."

  OPR's response in the Final Report to the fact that federal courts have confirmed Professor Yoo's analysis case law that OPR did not even bother to cite in its Draft Report—is that "Pierre [and the other cases were] decided long after the Bybee Memo was issued, and [have] no bearing on whether its authors presented a thorough view of the law at that time."" F.R. at 175 & n.132. In typical fashion, OPR misses the point, which is this: If Professor Yoo is guilty of misconduct for surveying the legal landscape and finding the meaning of "specific intent" in the torture statute relatively clear, why is the same not true for the federal judges who looked at the exact same precedent and conducted the exact same analysis? Our argument is not that Professor Yoo was sufficiently thorough merely because his conclusion was validated by subsequent courts, but that Professor Yoo was sufficiently thorough because his reasoning and methodology were replicated by the later judicial opinions that reached the same conclusion based on the same authorities. It appears that in OPR's world, Department of Justice attorneys must be clairvoyant enough to abide by the subjective standards of conduct promulgated by their political opponents and critics years after the event (e.g., they should have followed Johnsen's and Dellinger's "Principles Memo"), but they are to be given no credit for using the traditional tools of the legal craft to analyze a relevant legal issue, without the benefit of squarely applicable precedent in the torture context, in a manner that is subsequently vindicated by the unanimous judgment of courts of appeals that have considered the question. Indeed, although OPR does not acknowledged it, at the time the Bybee Memo issued, it was already clear that "torture can occur... only when the production of pain is purposive," that "torture requires acts both intentional and malicious," and that the defendant "must impose suffering cruelly and deliberately, rather than as the unforeseen or unavoidable incident of some legitimate end." Price v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2002).

  Here, again, OPR scours the transcripts of Professor Yoo's voluntary interviews with OPR in search of statements that it believes buttress its case. It highlights, in particular, Professor Yoo's statement that he had found the law on "intent" "confusing." F.R. at 166. Professor Yoo, of course, is not a criminal-law specialist, either as a practitioner or as an academic. There is no reason for him to have any specialized antecedent understanding of the issue. What OPR does not highlight, indeed it goes out of its way to minimize, is that this prompted Professor Yoo to seek specialized help of the highest conceivable quality-not only by ordering another lawyer to research the issue thoroughly, but also by vetting the memo's analysis with Michael Chertoff, the head of the Criminal Division, who was a former federal prosecutor (and future federal appellate judge).32 Whatever the degree of criminal-law expertise that he himself brought to the table—and however derisively OPR may now seek to characterize it—it is abundantly clear that Professor Yoo availed himself of the tools of a lawyer's craft to produce an analysis that was, and remains, impeccably correct. There is in fact a good reason that Professor Yoo's final memorandum did not note the "uncertainty or ambiguity" in the meaning of "specific intent": There was none. In June 2000, shortly before Professor Yoo sat down to write the Bybee Memo, the United States Supreme Court had issued Carter, which concluded that one subsection of the bank-robbery statute created a "general intent" crime while the other required a showing of "specific intent" to steal, and offered examples to "help to make the distinction between 'general' and 'specific' intent less esoteric." 530 U.S. at 268-70. In explaining the precise and straightforward distinctions between "general" and "specific" intent, the Court cited the LaFave treatise, id. at 268-69, the same authority that OPR now cites for the proposition that "specific intent" has not been used consistently by the courts, see F.R. at 169. This supposed inconsistency did not trouble the Supreme Court, presumably because the LaFave treatise also states, and demonstrates through numerous examples, that specific intent actually has one most common meaning in American law. 1  Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 5.2(e) (2d ed. 2003) (*the most common usage of 'specific intent' is to designate a special mental element which is required above and beyond any mental state required with respect to the actus reus of the crime[s]").

  Unlike the Bybee Memo, the Draft Report did not even cite the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, let alone discuss it. And the Final Report mentions Carter only in passing, making no effort to explain how Professor Yoo's reliance on the most recent Supreme Court opinion on specific intent could remotely suggest that Professor Yoo's analysis was not thorough, much less incompetent. OPR evidently believes that Professor Yoo should have emphasized for the client that older Supreme Court cases had found the concept of specific intent difficult or elusive, though the more recent (and binding) decision. in Carter had not. As a basis for professional discipline, this analysis borders on the frivolous. It may be that OPR attorneys do not believe in the ameliorative influence of the Supreme Court's opinions on the uncertainties and difficulties that attend most areas of law, but the rest of the legal profession (including judges and disciplinary boards) is generally required to work on the assumption that more recent, definitive rulings from that Court reflect a mature consideration and resolution of earlier-expressed uncertainties. Second, OPR concludes that "OLC's advice erroneously suggested that an interrogator who inflicted severe physical or mental pain or suffering on an individual would not violate the torture statute if he acted with the goal or purpose of obtaining information." F.R. at 160-61. But OPR is unable to point to any statement in the Bybee Memo that says or even implies this, instead relying on the following sentence: "'Thus, even if the defendant knows that severe pain will result from his actions, if causing such harm is not his objective, he lacks the requisite specific intent even though the defendant did not act in good faith." Id. at 167 (quoting Bybee Memo at 4). This criticism appears lifted from the Levin Memo. See F.R. at 168 (quoting Levin Memo at 17). Whatever Mr. Levin may have thought, every jot and tittle of the statement quoted by OPR is an entirely accurate statement of the law. Indeed, it precisely echoes the holding of the en banc Third Circuit in Pierre: "We disagree that proof of knowledge ... that severe pain or suffering will be the practically certain result ... satisfies the specific intent requirement in the CAT. Rather, we are persuaded ... that the specific intent requirement, included in the ratification history of the CAT, requires a petitioner to show that his prospective torturer will have the motive or purpose to cause him pain or suffering." 528 F.3d at 189. Under OPR's view, the ten judges in the Third Circuit majority have now committed professional misconduct by creating the impression—at least to OPR and Mr. Levin that a torturer acting with the purpose of obtaining information is immune from prosecution. But this is an unfounded criticism. In fact, when the minority in Pierre expressed the same concern, id. at 196, the ten-judge majority had little difficulty in explaining why this criticism is wrong and unjustified. Id. at 190 n.7. Significantly, it was obvious to all thirteen judges that the issue they were debating had arisen in the context of the Bybee Memos; the minority noted that "Jay Bybee... set forth an interpretation of 'specific intent' that is similar to that espoused by the majority," id. at 193, and the three judges who disagreed with the majority's analysis issued an opinion that was largely a pages-long quotation of the Levin Memo. OPR cannot credibly assert, merely because it finds the minority's views more persuasive, that the analysis that rather decisively carried the day in Pierre is sanctionable.

  Moreover, a moment's thought would have revealed to OPR why Congress believed the specific-intent requirement so important for the torture statute and why Professor Yoo properly stated that knowledge alone is insufficient. In the absence of a specific-intent requirement, a general-intent statute criminalizing "torture" could, for example, reach a surgeon who performs open heart surgery in an Army base in Germany, or a physician who must amputate a leg in the field of battle in order to save a soldier's life. Both "know" to a certainty that their conduct will inflict "severe pain or suffering," but neither, of course, is guilty of "torture," because "causing such harm is not his objective." The surgeon, in other words, would save the man's life painlessly if he could. But nowhere does the Bybee Memo state or imply that a defendant's actual intent to cause severe pain is absolved by an ultimate motive to obtain information.33 And critically, OPR does not cite any evidence-because there is none-suggesting that the CIA believed it could lawfully "torture" a detainee so long as it was trying to elicit information. Third, OPR concludes that "[s]ome of the Bybee Memo's analysis was oversimplified to the point of being misleading," F.R. at 171, because it "suggested that, in order to violate the torture statute, a defendant would have to act with a 'purpose to disobey the law,'" F.R. at 173. OPR's criticism is premised on a gross distortion of the memo's two-sentence discussion of Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135 (1994). The Bybee Memo cited Ratzlaf as an "example" of the application of a specific-intent requirement. The memo explained that because the statute at issue in Ratzlaf required "'specific intent to commit the crime,'' the defendant in that case had to act with the express "purpose to disobey the law.' Bybee Memo at 3 (quoting Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. at 141). OPR evidently believes that because the specific intent required in Ratzlaf was a specific intent to violate the law—a form of specific intent that statutes typically signal with the term "willful"-Professor Yoo was suggesting that the same type of specific intent was required under the torture statute.

  No reasonable person could think that, given the Bybee Memo's very next sentence: "Here, because Section 2340 requires that a defendant act with the specific intent to inflict severe pain, the infliction of such pain must be the defendant's precise objective." Bybee Memo at 3. Nowhere does the Bybee Memo suggest that intent to violate the law is required under the torture statute, and no one reading the memo's Ratzlaf discussion could take that away from it. In fact, if the memo even remotely was intended to suggest that intent to violate the law was required, one would expect to see this purported requirement used or even alluded to in the Classified Bybee Memo which was issued on the same day for the purpose of analyzing the specific techniques proposed by the CIA under the standards outlined in the Bybee Memo. But nothing there, of course, supports OPR's strained reading.

  Fourth, OPR claims that the good-faith defense to a specific-intent crime "is generally limited to fraud or tax prosecutions." F.R. at 174. OPR cites no authority for this, relying only on a quotation trom a jury-instructions treatise that does not support the assertion. In fact, two paragraphs later OPR actually cites a case that stands for the opposite proposition: In United States v. Goings, 313 F.3d 423: (8th Cir. 2002), the court found in a theft case that "[t]he district court properly gave the Eighth Circuit stock instruction on good faith." Id. at 427 (emphasis added). OPR thus manages, for once, to successfully refute an argument. Fifth, OPR argues that "[t]he availability of good faith as a defense to torture is not a foregone conclusion" because a 1983 Fourth Circuit decision did not allow a defendant to invoke the good-faith defense when prosecuted under a statute criminalizing the export of firearms. F.R. at 174 (citing United States v. Wilson, 721 F.2d 967 (4th Cir. 1983)). OPR's argument here is misleading. In Wilson, like in Ratzlaf (but unlike here), the statute had a willfulness requirement-i.e., a requirement that the defendant act with the specific intent to violate the law. See 721 F.2d at 970 n.1, 971. The defendant argued that he had believed his actions were lawful because they had been authorized by government officials, and therefore that he did not have the requisite specific intent to violate the law. See 721 F.2d at 974-75 & n.10. The Fourth Circuit found "insufficient evidence to justify" an instruction on the good-faith defense, however, because "none of th[e] evidence show[ed] that Wilson was still working for the government, or impliedly authorized by government officials to export firearms illegally." Id. at 975 (emphasis added). In other words, the defendant's good-faith defense had a factual predicate—that government officials had authorized his actions-for which the defendant had put forward no evidence. That holding casts no doubt on the Bybee Memo's discussion of specific intent.

  Relatedly, OPR says that the Bybee Memo was deficient in "failing] to advise the client that under some circumstances, a prosecutor can challenge a good faith defense by alleging willful blindness." F.R. at 174. The en banc Third Circuit in Pierre, however, had no trouble concluding that "willful blindness" is not relevant to an analysis of specific intent to torture. 528 F.3d at 188, 190. "Willful blindness," the Court explained, "can be used to establish knowledge but it does not satisfy the specific intent requirement in the CAT." Id. at 190. The Second Circuit reached the same conclusion in its own Pierre decision (involving a different petitioner with the same surname), explaining that it could "not see how" either "willful blindness" or "deliberate indifference," "which may bear on knowledge to the extent they establish conscious avoidance, can without more demonstrate specific intent, which requires that the actor intend the actual consequences of his conduct." 502 F.3d at 118. Willful blindness can be sufficient for knowledge (and thus general intent), but not specific intent.

  OPR attempts to counter Pierre's willful-blindness holding by arguing that its Draft Report "did not assert that the government could establish a defendant's specific intent through a willful blindness theory," but rather that "a willful blindness instruction might be granted under some circumstances to counter a defendant's claim that he held a good faith belief—based on knowledge obtained from the CIA-that the use of EIT's would not result in the infliction of severe mental or physical pain or suffering." F.R. at 175. In other words, OPR conceives of a hypothetical defendant who might be deemed to "know" (based on willful blindness) that a particular interrogation would result in the infliction of pain and suffering, despite what the CIA might have told him. Apart from being contrived and arcane, this feat of contortionism still misses the point: As Pierre holds, "knowledge" or awareness of the "result," even if it "could" be severe pain, does not meet the statutory standard, which requires the purposeful infliction of such pain. And, as in its Draft Report, OPR continues to rely solely on older cases that did not involve torture for its contentions that "the availability of good faith as a defense is not a foregone conclusion" and that "a prosecutor can challenge" an intent defense based on willful blindness "under some circumstances," and to criticize the Bybee Memo's failure to discuss "the possibility that a court might refuse to extend the good faith defense to a crime of violence such as torture" as rendering the analysis "incomplete." F.R. at 173-74 (emphases added). Of course, the Bybee Memo did caution that "as a matter of practice in the federal criminal justice system" a defendant who acted "unreasonably]" but in good faith was "unlikely" to be acquitted. Bybee Memo at 5. OPR's contrivances notwithstanding, the Bybee Memo is simply not subject to criticism in this regard. OPR dismisses as "cursory" the Bybee Memo's significant qualifying language, which made clear that a good-faith defense was unlikely to be successful if not reasonable. F.R. at 175. As OPR concedes, the memo "included qualifying language that made it clear that notwithstanding legal theory, as a practical matter a jury could infer specific intent from a defendant's actions." F.R. at 167. As a matter of fact, despite that the specific-intent discussion is only two pages long, the Bybee Memo notes in several places that much of the discussion is "theoretical," and that juries might well find specific intent notwithstanding the theory. See, e.g., Bybee Memo at 4 ("While as a theoretical matter such knowledge [that severe pain or suffering will result] does not constitute specific intent, juries are permitted to infer from the factual circumstances that such intent is present. Therefore, when a defendant knows that his actions will produce the prohibited result, a jury will in all likelihood conclude that the defendant acted with specific intent.") (internal citations omitted); id. at 5 (noting that "as a matter of practice in the federal criminal justice system" a defendant who acted "unreasonably]" but in good faith is "unlikely" to be acquitted.). It cannot be credibly said that these repeated qualifications are only cursory, nor can Professor Yoo and Judge Bybee be condemned for accurately describing the law while conveying real-world limitations on the legal doctrine. A fair reading of these two pages reveals that OPR's assertion is baseless.

  No doubt recognizing the highly qualified (and manifestly correct) specific-intent analysis provided in the Bybee Memo, OPR is forced to point to other sources to support its theory that the advice was insufficient. OPR states, for example, that "OLC's advice to the CIA on specific intent and good faith was not limited to the Bybee Memo. In the Yoo Letter, the Classified Bybee Memo, and the CIA Bullet Points, OLC presented an unqualified, oversimplified view of the law without acknowledging potential problems.' F.R. at 175-76; see also F.R. at 227 ("Yoo provided the CIA with an unqualified, permissive statement regarding specific intent in his July 13, 2002 letter"). But OPR's reliance on these documents merely demonstrates the lengths it is willing to go to present its entirely one-sided view. The Yoo Letter and the Classified Bybee Memo were delivered to the client along with the Bybee Memo on August 1, 2002, and were clearly meant to be read in conjunction with it. It is unreasonable to suggest that each of the documents should have re-plowed all of the ground covered in the Bybee Memo, much less that the failure to do so amounts to sanctionable conduct. The so-called Bullet Points, a CIA document providing an overview of OLC's analysis, would not be expected to provide the same detailed analysis as the Bybee Memo, and OPR does not allege that the specific-intent summary, see F.R. at 103, 165, incorrectly states the law.35 The July 13, 2002 letter, moreover, was clearly tentative, summary advice superseded by the more detailed analysis provided in the Bybee Memo. See F.R. at 162 & n.126 (noting the closing statement of the July 13, 2002 letter, "[a]s you know, our office is in the course of finalizing a more detailed memorandum opinion analyzing section 2340,'" and stating that "[w]hen the Bybee Memo was issued a few weeks later, it included a more extensive discussion of the specific intent element.").

  Sixth and finally, OPR cites the Levin Memo approvingly for the proposition that it would not be "useful to try to define the precise meaning of 'specific intent'" in the torture statute, because "it would not be appropriate to rely on parsing the specific intent element of the statute to approve as lawful conduct that might otherwise amount to torture." F.R. at 169. OPR appears to be suggesting that Professor Yoo should have omitted the clearly correct legal analysis of specific intent and instead ducked the issue altogether-declining to interpret one of the elements of the criminal statute that he was tasked with analyzing. But this is wrong under elementary principles of criminal law. A person does not violate a criminal statute unless his conduct meets each of the elements; and no competent lawyer could offer advice on whether conduct violates a criminal proscription without examining each element of the relevant statute. In other words, a complete and competent analysis could not conclude that "conduct that might otherwise amount to torture" actually is torture under this statute without first defining specific intent. OPR's inability to understand this simple point is inexplicable.

  B. Severe Pain.
  One of the most challenging tasks that the authors of the Bybee Memo faced was to give concrete meaning to the torture statute's ambiguous term "severe. pain" so that it could be applied to real-world interrogations of terrorists with information about future attacks. They first looked to dictionaries, which said that pain or suffering is "severe" if it is "of such a high level of intensity that the pain is difficult for the subject to endure." Bybee Memo at 5. As any competent lawyer would do, the authors then examined other statutes that used the term "severe pain" to determine whether Congress's use of the word "severe" in those statutes "shed more light on its meaning" in §2340(1). Id. Their research disclosed that Congress used the term "severe pain" in six different provisions (relating to health benefits) when defining an emergency medical condition. Under those statutes, an emergency medical condition is one:manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in(i) placing the health of the individual... in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww-22(d)(3)(B) (2003). The Bybee Memo expressly acknowledged that "these statutes address a substantially different subject from Section 2340," but, after citing West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83 (1991), found them "nonetheless helpful for understanding what constitutes severe physical pain." Bybee Memo at 6. The memo concluded that these health benefits statutes "suggest" that for pain to be sufficiently "severe" under Section 2340 such pain must rise to a "similarly high level-the level that would ordinarily be associated with a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury such as death, organ failure, or serious impairment of body functions." Id. at 6 (emphases added). OLC deemed those statutes relevant because they confirmed the ordinary meaning of the statutory language: "[T]his view of the criminal act of torture is consistent with the term's common meaning. Torture is generally understood to involve "intense pain' or 'excruciating pain,' or put another way, 'extreme anguish of body or mind."" Id. at 13 (quoting dictionaries).

  The Draft Report gave the Bybee Memo's consideration of the medical-benefits statutes top billing in OPR's catalogue of supposed analytical failings, emphatically asserting that citation to those statutes clearly was unconventional legal analysis amounting to professional misconduct. By OPR's lights, a lawyer could reasonably cite. other statutes in construing statutory language if those statutes were sufficiently related in subject matter as to be considered "in pari materia," but it was obvious incompetence for any trained lawyer to consider unrelated statutes in advising a client. And this should have been obvious to Professor Yoo, the Draft Report asserted, because Casey "was premised upon the in pari materia doctrine." D.R. 139. "We know of no authority," OPR said, "in support of the proposition that identical words or phrases in two unrelated statutes are relevant in interpreting an ambiguous term." D.R. at 138. Indeed, Professor Yoo easily could have discovered this obvious interpretive no-no, OPR sarcastically noted, because the Sutherland treatise on statutory interpretation "was available in the main DOJ library when the Bybee Memo was written." D.R. at 137-38 & n.121. We responded to the Draft Report by listing numerous cases—including Casey in which the Supreme Court of the United States has cited unrelated statutes in statutory interpretation.36 We also noted that this commonplace technique —for which OPR could find "no authority" after four years of research—is also discussed in the Sutherland treatise itself, which to devotes an entire chapter to "interpretation by reference to statutes on other subjects," with a section entitled "interpretive relevance of unrelated statutes." See 2B NORMAN J. SINGER, SUTHERLAND ON STATUTES & STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION ch. 53 (6th ed. 2000) (emphasis added). It is worth noting, again, that OPR was prepared to issue its Draft Report as final in January 2009, after years of supposedly exhaustive investigation and drafting had resulted is astoundingly incompetent legal work. At this point, even Emily Litella would have had the sense to say "never mind," and call it a day.37 But not OPR. Without acknowledging its previous errors, OPR now says that examining the language of unrelated statutes "is a recognized technique of statutory interpretation." F.R. at 182 (emphasis added). But OPR contends that for a lawyer to do so the statutes must be "similar in purpose or subject matter" or that there must "generally" be "a logical basis" for "courts [to] look to unrelated statutes for guidance." F.R. at 182-83. Here, OPR contends, the "medical benefits statutes were neither related, similar, nor analogous to the torture statute," and this, "coupled with the fact that they did not in fact define, explain or interpret the meaning of 'severe pain' led us to conclude that the Bybee Memo's reliance on those statutes was unreasonable." F.R. at 184. Unsurprisingly, however, OPR's newest set of fabricated rules of statutory interpretation once again fail to support the predetermined outcome to which OPR so relentlessly clings.

  The fundamental flaw in OPR's analysis lies in its failure (or unwillingness) to recognize why the Supreme Court so often consults unrelated statutes that contain language similar to the language under review. Unrelated statutes are relevant evidence of the ordinary meaning of the disputed language. See, e.g., Carcieri v. Salazar, 129 S. Ct. 1058, 1064 (2009) (usage in unrelated statutes confirmed the "ordinary meaning" of statutory language as set forth in dictionaries). As Sutherland explains, in a passage that OPR again declines to mention, one reason that looking to unrelated statutes is such a common technique of statutory interpretation-albeit one not as persuasive as looking to statutes in pari materia—is that the way Congress has used a particular phrase in the past, "even among statutes on different and dissimilar subjects," can reveal "common idioms and customary language usage." 2B SINGER § 53:01. Because of that, "[t]he difference between statutes which are closely enough related to be regarded as in pari materia and those which are not is ... only one of degree." Id. § 53:02. Moreover, as Casey noted in the passage that was cited in the Bybee Memo, the Supreme Court construes new statutory language "to contain that permissible meaning which fits most logically and. comfortably into the body of both previously and subsequently enacted law," because "it is our role to make sense rather than nonsense out of the corpus juris." 499 U.S. at 100-01. That is, the entire "body of the law" (the corpus juris) provides a fundamental backdrop for consistent interpretation of like statutory terms, at least when the text of the new statute does not itself affirmatively "prevent] such accommodation." Id. at 101; see, e.g., Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 448 n.3 (2006) (court's "natural reading" was "confirmed" by the use of the same word "elsewhere in the United States Code" - not just those parts of the Code that were "similar" or had a supposed "logical connection" with the subject matter). OPR does not contend that the torture statute by its terms foreclosed reliance on the medical-benefits statutes; nor could it, given that those statutes were cited solely because they appeared to confirm the ordinary meaning suggested by dictionary definitions and even OPR does not contend that a lawyer commits misconduct by consulting standard English dictionaries.

  OPR does not address the reasoning of these cases, but it simply announces that unrelated statutes may not be consulted at all unless there is a "logical basis" for doing so. OPR does not explain what exactly are the contours of this requirement (much less whence it comes), but the examples it cites make clear that this "test" is either trivial (in the sense that every unrelated statute meets it) or meaningless, or both. For example, OPR first says that it makes some difference that the word or phrase in the unrelated statute "has been interpreted by the courts." F.R. at 183. This point appears designed solely to distinguish Carcieri v. Salazar, supra, which interpreted the word "now" in the Indian Reorganization Act in part by looking to how the Court had previously interpreted the word in a federal criminal statute and a citizenship statute. 129 S. Ct. at 1064. Of course, when Congress uses a phrase that has previously acquired a well-settled meaning in judicial rulings courts will presume that the same meaning is intended in the new statute. But that is not remotely what happened in Carcieri, where the Court made clear that one of the interpretations on which it relied post-dated the Indian Reorganization Act. Id. What was at issue instead was the policy identified by the Supreme Court in Casey-viz., construing like terms similarly in order to "make sense rather than nonsense" out of the entire United States Code. (Indeed, Casey expressly noted that, absent this policy, it would not make sense to consult "both previously and subsequently enacted law," because "how could an earlier Congress know what a later Congress would enact?" 499 U.S. at 100-01).

  In any event, OPR does not explain why it should make any difference that the particular unrelated statute has received a judicial construction; if, by OPR's lights, the underlying statute lacks a "logical connection" to the statute being construed, then presumably any judicial interpretation of that unrelated statute would be just as logically unconnected to the problem at hand.

  OPR distinguishes Buckeye Check Cashing, supra, by claiming there was "some logical basis" for referring "to language in completely dissimilar statutes" throughout the United States Code in that the term at issue was used elsewhere consistently with the meaning that the Court had already derived by consulting other sources, and "the Court did not rely solely upon similar language in dissimilar statutes." F.R. at 183-84 & n. 138 (emphasis added). If this distinction is not wholly question-begging (i.e., there is a "logical" connection only if OPR subjectively believes the citation supports the point at issue), the same could be said about the Bybee Memo, which used the medical-benefits statutes in conjunction with dictionary sources. Finally, OPR's distinction of Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U.S. 607 (1992), not only is unhelpful to OPR's case but also shows its "logical connection" test to be utterly trivial. According to OPR, the "logical basis" for the Court's use of unrelated statutes in DOE was that the unrelated statutes showed "usage of [the] term in other contexts." F.R. at 183. But of course any inclusion of a term in another statute gives context to the term. That was the reason that the Bybee Memo looked to the use of "severe pain" in the medical-benefits statute—to infer from its context the level of pain that the ordinary meaning of the term connoted. 38 OPR's "logical basis" requirement is thus a meaningless distinction drawn to salvage a fatally flawed argument, akin to the last-minute scribbling on a law-school bluebook when the student realizes that the entire premise of his answer is mistaken.

  OPR's remaining criticisms are similarly misdirected, and none provides a basis for professional discipline. OPR contends that the Bybee Memo paraphrased the language of the medical-benefits statutes in a way that heightened the standard for severe pain. According to OPR, for instance, the Memo equated the medical-benefits statutes' phrase "serious jeopardy" with the word "death." F.R. at 178. It did not. What the Memo said was that the statutes treat "severe pain as an indicator of ailments that are likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage .... Such damage must rise to the level of death, organ failure, or the permanent impairment of a significant bodily function." Bybee Memo at 6 (emphases added). The import of these sentences is that the pain must be such that accompanies conditions likely to result in death or other serious conditions-in other words, pain that accompanies conditions that put a person's health in "serious jeopardy." OPR's other claims of a "heightened standard" rely on an absurdly narrow parsing of the medical-benefits statutes' language. OPR believes that "serious dysfunction of any bodily organ," for example, may not be paraphrased as "organ failure," and that "serious impairment to bodily functions" may not be paraphrased as "permanent damage." F.R. at 178. OPR gives no explanation for why it thinks these phrases are not equivalent, and many reasonable English speakers would surely think that they are. It is curious that OPR finds it acceptable to paraphrase D.C. Rule 2.I's "honest assessment" requirement as a duty of "thoroughness, objectivity, and candor," but considers it sanctionable for the Bybee Memo to have paraphrased "serious dysfunction of a bodily organ" as "organ failure." OPR also contends that the Bybee Memo's analysis was "illogical" because "the intensity of pain that accompanies organ failure or death has no commonly understood meaning." F.R. at 178. But this is a most debatable proposition. The medical-benefits statutes themselves, after all, call for a judgment about whether a "prudent lay person" would think a level of pain is sufficiently severe as to indicate a serious jeopardy to health or bodily functions. And it is certainly not unheard-of to describe the severity of the pain that is required under the torture statute as "agony," even though "agony" can literally precede, and often does precede, death. For example, in interpreting the definition of "torture" in the Torture Victim Protection Act, the D.C. Circuit explained with respect to the meaning of "severe" that "(t]he more intense, lasting, or heinous the agony, the more likely it is to be torture." Price, 294 F.3d at 93; see also id. at 95 ("excruciating and agonizing"); id. at 92 ("The severity requirement is crucial to ensuring that the conduct proscribed... is sufficiently extreme and outrageous to warrant the universal condemnation that the term 'torture' both connotes and invokes"). The court provided no more detailed explanation than that. Just as with the Bybee Memo's description of "severe pain," there is no "readily identifiable level of pain" associated with "agony" that is "intense, lasting, or heinous." But surely OPR would not contend that Judges Edwards, Silberman and Sentelle committed professional misconduct by describing the severity of the pain associated with torture in such terms." OPR's related contention that there are some forms of death or organ failure "not associated with pain" is beside the point. The Bybee Memo's bottom line was that the pain must be "pain or suffering of the kind that is equivalent to the pain that would be associated with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body function will likely result." Bybee Memo at 13 (emphases added). Anyone reading that in context would understand that the Memo is talking about pain from an "injury," i.e., a trauma of the sort that could be inflicted in an enhanced interrogation, not dying in your sleep.

  Perhaps most unfairly, OPR alleges that "[t]he Bybee Memo's definition could be interpreted as advising interrogators that they may legally inflict pain up to the point of organ failure, death, or serious physical injury." F.R. at 180. It could not. The Memo says that the pain must rise to the level that "would ordinarily be associated with a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury such as death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions." Bybee Memo at 6. There is no way to interpret this sentence other than that if the pain is equivalent to the pain that accompanies those conditions, the infliction qualifies as torture, whether or not it actually does result in those conditions. It certainly would not be so misinterpreted by the sophisticated legal audience at which the Bybee Memo was directed-especially given the analysis in the Classified Bybee Memo, which carefully examined the level of physical pain caused by the individual interrogation techniques even though none of those techniques cause death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions. See Classified Bybee Memo at 9-10 ("With respect to physical pain, we previously concluded that 'severe pain' within the meaning of Section 2340 is pain that is difficult for the individual to endure and is of an intensity akin to the pain accompanying serious physical injury.").Finally, OPR appears to suggest that the phrase "severe pain" is not ambiguous, because "any difficulty in interpreting the term 'severe pain' is more properly attributable to the subjective nature of physical pain, rather than ambiguous language." F.R. at 181 n.135 (quoting Levin Memo at 8 n.18). But pure linguistic ambiguity—i.e., ambiguity arising out of multiple dictionary definitions of the same worddoes not exhaust the realm of statutory ambiguity. The classic cases of ambiguous phrases in the administrative-law context have no linguistic ambiguity at all-think, for example, of "just and reasonable" in the rate-setting statutes-but rather ambiguity arising out of the "subjective nature" of the assessment called for by the term. And the Supreme Court would no doubt be surprised to learn that the terms "due process" or "cruel and unusual" are entirely free from ambiguity, or that the phrase "serious potential risk of physical injury to another" in the Armed Career Criminal Act is clear just because its dictionary definition is undisputed, compare, e.g., James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 209-12 (2007), with id. at 227-28 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Moreover, it would be passing strange, to say the least, for OPR to maintain that the phrase "severe pain" is somehow used in a completely different way in the medical-benefits statutes but that the phrase itself is not ambiguous—and thus necessarily to be given the same interpretation in all contexts in which it appears.

  C. US Judicial Interpretations.
  OPR concedes that there were no reported criminal prosecutions under the torture statute for the Bybee Memo to discuss, but faults the memo's treatment of related decisions under (1) immigration regulations implementing CAT Article 3, and (2) the Torture Victim Protection Act. OPR's basic complaint here is that Professor Yoo "ignored" the immigration decisions, which were a "relevant body of case law," and that Professor Yoo's "discussion of the TVPA cases focused on the more brutal examples." F.R. at 186. Since the Bybee Memo did in fact discuss the "body of case law" dealing with torture in the immigration context, and the since leading cases before and after the Bybee Memo was issued have affirmed that torture encompasses only "extreme and outrageous acts," Price, 294 F.3d at 92, OPR's assertions illustrate nothing so much as the contortions that OPR is willing to undertake to sustain its relentless smear. First, after grandly asserting that Professor Yoo "ignored a relevant body of case law that has applied the CAT definition of torture in the context of removal proceedings against aliens," F.R. at 186, OPR quickly must concede that immigration cases were discussed in the Appendix to the Bybee Memo (making it difficult to understand how anyone could claim that they were "ignored"). But OPR still finds fault with the fact that the underlying immigration regulations were not cited or discussed, and suggests that it was somehow improper to fail to cite two additional Ninth Circuit cases that "provid[ed] additional examples of how courts have distinguished between torture and less severe conduct." F.R. at 187 (citing Al-Saher v. INS, 268 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2001), Cornejo-Barreto v. Seifert, 218 F.3d 1004, 1016 (9th Cir. 2000), and Khanuja v. IN.S., 11 Fed. App'x 824 (9th Cir. 2001)) (emphasis added).

  It should be apparent to any impartial observer that an attorney's failure to apprise his client of "additional examples" of any legal proposition is a rather novel theory of professional irresponsibility. After all, as OPR is ultimately forced to concede, F.R. at 187 n.140, the Bybee Memo did discuss cases interpreting the relevant regulations. For example, Al-Saher, one of the cases OPR identifies in support of its argument, is included in the Appendix with a description of the conduct that the court found to be torture. The decision quoted 8 C.F.R. 208.18 and found that the conduct at issue met the regulatory definition. The Bybee Memo cited the case with the parenthetical that it was a "deportation case," clearly marking it as involving immigration. This is far more extensive treatment than OPR itself provides for that case in its Final Report, which cites the case without noting, stating, or discussing anything whatsoever about it beyond the fact that it involved an (undescribed) torture claim. The Appendix to the Bybee Memo also summarized a second case interpreting 8 C.F.R. 208, Bi Zhu Lin v. Ashcroft, 183 F. Supp. 2d 551 (D. Conn. 2002). Nor does OPR explain why it believes that the Bybee Memo should have undertaken a completely tangential and immaterial discussion of the immigration regulations themselves as opposed to the case-law under them—it does not identify a single solitary aspect of the immigration regulations that it believes merited particular mention or discussion. OPR's theory is unexplained and inexplicable. OPR likewise does not discuss the particulars of either Cornejo-Barreto or Khanuja, which it believes should have been cited as "additional examples." Both are inapposite. Cornejo-Barreto considered whether judicial review could extend, via habeas, to decisions by the Secretary of State to extradite fugitives who claim they will be tortured in the foreign country. The Court held that it could so exercise judicial review. It did not interpret the substantive meaning of the regulation, federal laws defining torture, or the Convention Against Torture. It found only that a fugitive could raise in habeas a claim that torture would occur-but it explicitly declared that it would not reach the merits of the petitioner's claim. Id. at 1017. Khanuja, an unpublished and non-precedential decision, denied a petition for asylum on the ground of religious persecution, not torture, and explained only that religious persecution would not state a claim, by itself, to prevent removal on the grounds of possible torture. For good measure, as Deputy Attorney General Filip informed OPR, a citation to Khanuja, an unpublished decision, would have been sanctionable under the rules of the Ninth Circuit. R. at 187 n.141; Mukasey Letter at 6 & n.4 (citing cases in which the Ninth Circuit issued orders to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for citing unpublished decisions). This does not detain OPR, which believes that although citing that case would be grounds for discipline in the court that issued it (i.e., the court one would think most likely to find its intrinsic reasoning impressive), nothing expressly "forbids" citing the case "in executive branch legal memoranda or reports." F.R. at 187 n.141.

  The best that could be said for this extraordinarily strained argument is that it might conceivably persuade a singularly inattentive reader of the notion that citing Khanuja is only arguably sanctionable, not indubitably so. It does not remotely show that Professor Yoo departed from professional norms by failing to cite this irrelevant unpublished case in the Bybee Memo. In the end, even OPR understands that its arguments about the immigration cases not only are picayune to the point of absurdity but also cannot overcome the fact that the Bybee Memo correctly assessed the relevance of those cases to the inquiry at hand. This is in stark contrast to OPR's own Draft Report, which wholly ignored Pierre and Auguste in its discussion of intent where they were incontestably relevant. As OPR puts it: The Bybee Memo's failure to discuss the CAT regulations was a relatively minor omission, and we note that the case law and CAT regulations are generally consistent with the Bybee Memo's uncontroversial conclusion that torture is an aggravated from of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. We note the omission here because of our determination that OLC's interpretation of the torture statute in the context of the CIA interrogation program demanded the highest level of thoroughness, objectivity, and candor. Id. at 187 (emphasis added). This paragraph highlights OPR's consistent approach: making pedantic and strained criticisms that do not call into question the analysis or ultimate conclusions of the memo, but that supposedly are relevant to OPR's "just for this case" heightened standard of professional responsibility. Second, OPR also criticizes the Bybee Memo's treatment of decisions under the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), concluding that the discussion "focused on the more brutal examples of conduct courts have found to be torture, and downplayed less severe examples in the reported decisions." F.R. at 186. OPR is particularly critical of the fact that that the Bybee Memo included an extended discussion of Mehinovic v. Vuckovic, 198 F. Supp. 2d 1322 (N.D. Ga. 2002), because it believes that two other cases— Daliberti v. Republic of Iraq, 146 F. Supp. 2d 19 (D.D.C. 2001), and Simpson v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 180 F. Supp. 2d 78 (D.D.C. 2001)-stand for the proposition that acts "less extreme" than the court confronted in Mehinovic could also amount to torture. F.R. at 188-89. OPR also complains that the Bybee Memo was wrong to say that a single blow and its attendant pain, considered in isolation, could not amount to torture, and that if Mehinovic were read to stand for that proposition it would be wrong. This is yet another instance of OPR faulting Professor Yoo for giving clearly correct legal advice.

  The Bybee Memo made clear that Mehinovic was cited because, while most cases provide "limited analysis" of the torture question, Mehinovic was a "recent" case that "provide[d] some assistance in predicting how future courts might address this issue." Bybee Memo at 24. Nothing about providing "some assistance" in "predicting" how courts "might" rule in future cases would suggest to a reasonable reader that the case was being proffered as exemplifying the minimum quantum of abuse required to meet the statutory definition of torture. Indeed, the immediately preceding paragraph summarized the extreme types of abusive conduct that had been the subject of judicial rulings but expressly cautioned that "we cannot say with certainty that acts falling short of these. would not constitute torture under Section 2340 ...." Id. (emphasis in original). And the memo's discussion of the case concluded by emphasizing "that Mehinovic presents, with the exception of the single blow to [one of the victims], facts that are well over the line of what constitutes torture" Id. at 27." The case was nonetheless useful, the Bybee Memo concluded, in illustrating that TVPA cases "generally ... are in keeping with the general notion that the term 'torture' is reserved for acts of the most extreme nature." Moreover, both Daliberti and Simpson were cited and summarized in the Appendix to the Bybee Memo as relevant authorities, so OPR's complaint—an ethical complaint, no less is—is that Professor Yoo cited and discussed all the TVPA authorities that OPR believes were relevant but his judgments about appropriate emphasis (and on which cases would be most informative for the client) does not accord with OPR's. Moreover, OPR's contention that both cases were obviously "less extreme" than Mehinovic is also rather subjective. In Daliberti, Iraqi guards attempted to execute one of the plaintiffs and threatened another with undeniable acts of torture, 146 F. Supp. 2d at 22-23, while Simpson also involved death threats and interrogation during prolonged incommunicado detention, 180 F. Supp. 2d at 81. Indeed, even if the Bybee Memo were read as asserting that the conduct in Simpson was not torture, it would be correct: the district court's opinion was unanimously reversed by the D.C. Circuit after the issuance of the Bybee Memo upon a finding that the acts in question did not amount to torture. The D.C. Circuit explained that "[a]lthough these alleged acts certainly reflect a bent toward cruelty on the part of their perpetrators, they are not in themselves so unusually cruel or sufficiently extreme and outrageous as to constitute torture within the meaning of the Act." Simpson v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 326 F.3d 230, 234 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (per Sentelle, J., joined by Henderson and Tatel, JJ).

  OPR devotes almost an entire page of its Final Report to discussing the district court's decision in Simpson but notes only in the briefest of footnotes that the decision was reversed. F.R. at 189 & n.144. If the placement of authority in footnotes or appendices, as opposed to text, or the extensiveness of the discussion given to one versus the other were an ethical issue that calls for bar discipline, it is doubtful that the authors of the Final Report would ever again be permitted to leave the office of the bar's disciplinary counsel. But OPR's reasons that the D.C. Circuit opinion is simply not relevant to the analysis because it was "issued ... after the Bybee and Yoo Memos had been issued." Id. The country's leading ethics experts disagree with OPR on its rather counterintuitive position that decisions that clearly prove the Bybee Memo correct must be wholly disregarded in assessing the adequacy of the advice given merely because they were not yet available at the time the memo was written. See Rotunda Letter at 3; Hazard Letter at 3. In any event, the advice was clearly correct under the law as it existed even when the memo was written: The D.C. Circuit's decision in Simpson applied and quoted extensively from its earlier decision in Price, which preceded the Bybee Memo by a month. As Simpson noted, Price had already held that "[t]orture does not automatically result whenever individuals in official custody are subjected even to direct physical assault.'* Simpson, 326 F.3d at 234 (quoting Price, 294 F.3d at 93). The allegations that Price had held insufficient to state a claim for torture included the facts that the plaintiffs were "kicked, clubbed and beaten," "interrogated and subjected to physical, mental and verbal abuse," and "held in deplorable conditions while incarcerated, including urine-soaked mattresses, a cramped cell with substandard plumbing that they were forced to share with seven other inmates, a lack of medical care, and inadequate food." Price, 294 F.3d at 86. Price emphasized that there is an important distinction between "actual torture" and "mere police brutality," and concluded that the facts pleaded did not "reasonably support a finding that the physical abuse allegedly inflicted by Libya evinced the degree of cruelty necessary to reach a level of torture." Id. at 93, 94. Never once in its report does OPR mention the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Price. Not once. In sum, OPR goes to great lengths to manufacture criticisms that ignore the numerous caveats expressed by the Bybee Memo about how courts were likely to deal with claims of torture under the TVPA, and never comes anywhere close to impugning the Bybee Memo's basic conclusion that cases under the TVPA "are in keeping with the general notion that "torture" is reserved for acts of the most extreme nature." Bybee Memo at 27. That statement of the law was, and remains, wholly and unquestionably correct.

  D. International Decisions.
OPR objects to the Bybee Memo's discussion of two decisions from foreign tribunals: Ireland v. United Kingdom, a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, and Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v. Israel, a decision of the Israeli Supreme Court. F.R. at 190. Although OPR apparently reads this section as an incomplete effort to assess "international opinion" and comprehensively survey international law, id., the Bybee Memo makes clear at the outset that these decisions were being discussed simply to illustrate how other Western countries have understood the distinction between "torture" on the one hand and "cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment" on the other: "International decisions can prove of some value in assessing what conduct might rise to the level of severe mental pain or suffering. ... As this Part will discuss, other Western nations have generally used a high standard in determining whether interrogation techniques violate the international prohibition on torture." Bybee Memo at 27 (also noting that while international decisions "can prove of some value," they are "in no way binding authority upon the United States"). OPR does not argue that this conclusion is mistaken, nor does it explain why consultation of these opinions in this way violated professional norms. Perhaps more significantly, OPR condemns Judge Bybee and Professor Yoo for discussing these cases, but fails to grapple with its own factual finding that the limited discussion was included in response to a direct request by the CIA: "The CIA personnel at the meeting asked Yoo for guidance on the legality of their plan under the torture statute, the CAT, and European and Israeli case low." F.R. at 41 & n.45 (noting that "the reference was clearly to the two cases referenced above - Ireland v. United Kingdom and PCATI v. Israel) (emphasis added). OPR's indictment of Professor Yoo and Judge Bybee for including a discussion of these particular cases, when the ClA had made a specific request for their inclusion, is simply baffling. 

  OPR's quibbling critiques of the section are similarly misdirected. For example, OPR compiles a list of five "important facts" related to Ireland v. U.K. that the Bybee Memo "ignored" and that OPR contends would have been included in a "thorough, objective, and candid examination" of the case. F.R. at 191-92. But OPR's first three facts-that an investigating commission found the techniques to be torture and the U.K. did not contest the finding, that an internal U.K. review found the techniques to be prohibited by domestic law, and that the U.K. renounced further use of the techniques— are utterly irrelevant to the court's determination that the methods did not constitute torture within the meaning of the law. And the fourth and fifth items on OPR's list, which fault the Bybee Memo for not describing the dissenting opinions in the European Court of Human Rights and for not stating that the majority held that Great Britain's interrogation methods violated the European Convention on Human Rights, are similarly without merit. Whether to mention a dissent or not is a matter of judgment; American lawyers and judicial opinions regularly discuss precedent without delving into the dissents. And OPR's claim that the Bybee Memo did not disclose that the European Court had found Great Britain's methods to violate the European Convention is simply mistaken. The Bybee Memo says that the European Convention prohibits both torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, Bybee Memo at 27-28, and it states clearly that the "European Court of Human Rights concluded that these techniques used in combination, and applied for hours at a time, were inhuman and degrading but did not amount to torture." Id. at 29.

  OPR additionally faults the Bybee Memo for not including a discussion of every subsequent European Court case considering Ireland v. U.K. But OPR does not contest the Bybee Memo's conclusion that Ireland is the "leading" European Court of Human Rights Case, see Bybee Memo at 28, and OPR admits (albeit in a footnote) that "[m]uch of that case law in fact supports the uncontroversial conclusion that the term 'torture' should be applied to more severe forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment." F.R. at 192 & n.147 (emphasis added). Although OPR suggests that a subsequent case "raised questions about the continuing validity" of Ireland, F.R. at 193 (citing Selmouni v. France), a review of that case reveals that it repeatedly cites the Ireland case favorably. That it included some general language (not tied to Ireland) about the European Convention being a "living document" that might be interpreted differently over time does nothing to undermine the Bybee Memo's discussion of Ireland. In any event, failure to discuss such vague dicta does not even remotely suggest professional misconduct. OPR's criticisms are inexplicably trifling. OPR's treatment of the Israeli case is similarly tendentious. OPR takes issue with the Bybee Memo's statement that the Israeli case is best read as finding that the five Israeli interrogation techniques challenged therein did not amount to torture, calling this conclusion "misleading." F.R. at 194. But the Bybee Memo concedes that "[t]o be sure, such a conclusion [regarding whether the techniques at issue amounted only to torture] was unnecessary [to the court's decision] because even if the acts only amounted to cruel and inhuman treatment the GSS lacked authority to use the five methods." Bybee Memo at 30. Rather, the memo relied, inter alia, on the fact that "the court carefully avoided describing any of these acts as having the severity of pain or suffering indicative of torture" in reaching its conclusion. Id. Indeed, OPR points to nothing in the Israeli opinion that describes any of the interrogation methods as rising to the level of torture, and the language used in the opinion in fact supports the Bybee Memo's conclusion. See, e.g., PCATI at 1| 25 (concluding that stress position technique is "degrading"); | 30 (favorably citing Ireland for the proposition that a "similar" combination of interrogation methods were "inhuman and degrading"). Of course, the case was also relevant in light of the Israeli Supreme Court's observation that otherwise impermissible interrogation methods can be justified by necessity in appropriate circumstances. In the end, while OPR's convoluted criticisms would be the envy of a professional contortionist, they add nothing of substance to OPR's claim that Professor Yoo violated ethical norms.<sup>[[37]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-yoofinal.pdf#page=41)</sup></sup> <sup>[[38]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-bybeefinal.pdf#page=52)</sup></sup> <sup>[[39]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-margolis.pdf)</sup></sup>


  ## Yugoslav Wars
Due to the overlap and proximity of these conflicts, I've addressed them in a narrative format, quoting exclusively from Historians, legal scholars and independent investigations.

### Kosovo War (1998–1999)

#### Overview 

- With Tito's death in 1980, the relative calm that had pervaded Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end as ethnic and nationalist differences flared up yet again. Initially, Kosovar Albanians rioted in 1981 over poor living, economic, and educational conditions. Pristina University became a "hotbed of Albanian nationalism," and another mass exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo followed anti-Serb riots by the Albanian population. In response, Serbian anger continued to increase as Serbs now saw themselves as the aggrieved, disadvantaged party. By 1987, swelling Serbian resentment led to massive protest marches and rallies, paving the way for Slobodan Milosevic,106 who surged to power on a platform of radical Serb nationalism. Milosevic's first guarantee was that he would protect ethnic Serbs from abuse in Kosovo. He then had the Serbian government outlaw school instruction in the Albanian language. In 1989, he succeeded in completely stripping Kosovo of its autonomy108 and sent in the Serbian Army and Serbian police units to maintain order and discipline after rioting occurred in response to the constitutional amendments revoking Kosovo autonomy. From 1989 through late 1992, Milosevic effectively enforced a state of emergency in Kosovo, in which Serbian "security" forces suppressed Albanian media, language education, protests, and strikes.

  Kosovo and other Yugoslav republics evinced strong concerns over Milosevic's actions in short order. Albanian legislators met secretly in 1990, declared the Republic of Kosovo to be in existence, and created a "shadow" Kosovo government—the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK)—led by Dr. Ibrahim Rugova. In an effort to avoid being similarly swept up in Milosevic's centralization and nationalistic policies, first Slovenia, in 1990, and then Croatia, in 1991, declared independence from Yugoslavia. Milosevic responded by sending Yugoslav tanks into Slovenia. As a result, Yugoslavia effectively ceased to exist as of 27 June 1991. By 1992 the situation within the region had deteriorated drastically. The Communist world in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe had collapsed and the call for revolution continued to drift across southern Europe and the Yugoslav republics. Already in dire straits as the result of a massive debt and triple-digit inflation and heavily dependent on Western aid, the Yugoslav economy bordered on collapse with the advent of an international economic embargo in late 1991 against Serbia and Montenegro. Slovenia had already achieved independence, and the bloody slugfest within Croatia continued. Macedonia declared independence in January 1992, and Bosnia and Herzegovina followed suit in March 1992. However, this declaration of Bosnian independence from Yugoslavia led only to a violent struggle between the Bosnian Serbs, supported by Serbia, and the Bosnian Muslims. The Serbs sought to divide the country along ethnic lines and unite with a "Greater Serbia." In the midst of all of this, Serbia and Montenegro joined together to form the new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992, with Milosevic at the helm. On one side of the Bosnian conflict were the Bosnian Serbs, led by Premiere Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, and the "Chetniks." They both had the support of Yugoslav National Army (JNA) units, and were intent on eradicating the Muslim population through terror tactics and a vicious ethnic cleansing program. Pitted against them were the Bosnian Muslims, who were merely attempting to hold on to as much territory as possible. To further complicate matters, however, the Bosnian Croats were also seeking to obtain Bosnian land for Croatia and were attacking Bosnian Muslims as well.

  During 1998, a full-fledged civil war opened up between Serbia and Kosovo. In the battles between Serb military and police forces and the KLA, thousands died and hundreds of thousands sought refuge elsewhere. Kosovo quickly became the foremost concern of the international community, posing grave humanitarian concerns and risking spillover into neighboring countries, which needed little to fan the existing embers of ethnic hatred and violence. A six-country "Contact Group" formed and initially called for negotiations on autonomy in place of armed conflict. Buttressed by internal support for his policies, Milosevic rejected the calls for Serbia to cease all military action in Kosovo. Instead, Milosevic sent more troops into Kosovo and escalated the level of fighting during the summer months of 1998. In response, the North Atlantic Council (NAC)130 asked NATO to explore and assess numerous military options to end the crisis in Kosovo.

 
  A January 2000 Report to Congress finds, "The Ushtria Clirimtare E Kosoves (UCK), or the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), was formed in the early 1990s with the goal of using force to create an independent Kosovo and, ultimately, a "Greater Albania* that would unite ethnic Albanians in Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. A secretive organization with access to light infantry weapons and small amounts of explosives, the UCK in 1996 launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and hit and-run attacks against Serb government facilities and personnel, as well as ethnic Albanians it suspected of collaboration with Serb authorities. The former UCK leadership continues to call for the independence of Kosovo. During the war, the leadership ceased public calls for a "Greater Albania." Beyond independence and economic reconstruction, the former UCK leadership has revealed little of its political platform. Further, neither the US, nor NATO, provided support to the KLA/UCK.

  UCK attacks had only a limited impact on Serb forces in Kosovo, and the group. remained a marginal force in the Kosovo Albanian autonomy movement. However, the deaths of 80 Kosovo Albanians, including many women and children, during a March 1998 raid by Serb security forces on a suspected UCK compound in central Kosovo galvanized support for armed resistance among ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the diaspora. The UCK seized the leadership of the growing insurgency and expanded quickly in the following months-in part due to the ready availability of large numbers of weapons and military equipment looted from Albanian Army stores during the previous year and a willingness of Kosovo Albanians to volunteer for service. Despite its growing strength, the UCK was unable to counter the Yugoslav Army offensive that started in March 1999. UCK units attempted to defend villages and protect ethnic Albanian civilians throughout Kosovo, but were overwhelmed by the Serbs' superior firepower. The deployment of international military forces into Kosovo in June 1999, however, brought an end to the fighting. The UCK agreed to demilitarize and transform into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), a non-military organization with civil defense duties, such as emergency rescue and disaster relief. KFOR officials in late August certified the UCK was compliant with the demilitarization requirements, and the UCK officially disbanded in late September 1999.

  The UCK leadership does not appear to have engaged in narcotics operations to support its activities during the war. Press reporting of various degrees of reliability indicates that some members of the former UCK are involved in narcotics smuggling, but we have no information on the scale of these activities. The UCK was not involved in terrorist activities-defined as premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets. We do not have a definitive count of the number of noncombatant civilians killed by the UCK since its formation. The UCK primarily targeted Serb government personnel and facilities, as well as ethnic Albanians who were suspected of collaborating with Serb authorities. However, press reports suggest that some UCK members have been involved in intimidation attacks and retribution killings since Serb forces withdrew from the province in June 1999."

  In addition, Scholars have concluded, "all available evidence refutes the proposition aggressively advanced by the Milosevic regime that the KLA was mainly financed by drug and prostitution money."<sup>[[1]](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=c033421)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/report-on-kla)</sup></sup>

  Amid the unearthing of evidence of additional massacres and the continued rejection of peace overtures by Milosevic, the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution (UNSCR) 1199 on 23 September 1998. The resolution called for an immediate cease-fire, an international presence, and the immediate withdrawal of Serbian troops from within Kosovo. Although the Serbs thereafter claimed to have complied, at least in part, the Contact Group observed no evidence of such compliance. Thus, while the Contact Group sent U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and others to Belgrade to obtain Milosevic's assurances of future compliance with the terms of the resolution, on 13 October 1998 NATO authorized air strikes in the event that Milosevic ultimately failed to comply.

  The Serb massacre of forty-five Albanians in the village of Racak on 15 January 1999 forced the international community’s hand once again. NATO issued a "solemn warning" to both sides that it would resort to military force immediately if they did not again heed the terms of the cease fire. In an effort to settle the rising tension, the Contact Group announced a peace conference in Rambouillet, France, near Paris, on 6 February 1999. The warring parties received Western-drafted proposals on how to resolve the ongoing conflict and were "provided" a deadline by which they were to agree to the proposals. Although the Serbs initially expressed a willingness to discuss the proposal's terms, they reneged at subsequent meetings held in Paris in mid-March. As a result, the negotiations ended, the violence in Kosovo intensified, the KVM withdrew, and NATO once again threatened a strong military response. On 22 March, Holbrooke attempted a "last-ditch" effort to convince Milosevic to sign the agreement and prevent a military confrontation. The international community hoped to avoid air strikes but nonetheless continued to plan them. However, Holbrooke’s efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. On 24 March, NATO forces began a campaign of air strikes—code-named Operation Allied Force—against FRY military targets to force the Serbs to cease hostilities and allow ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes in Kosovo.

  Finally, on 3 June, Milosevic and the Serbian National Assembly accepted a peace plan that arose out of negotiations initiated by Russian Special Envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin. On 10 June, after having received confirmation from SACEUR that Serb forces were withdrawing from Kosovo pursuant to the terms of a NATO–FRY Military-Technical Agreement (MTA) dated 9 June, NATO officially halted the air strikes. Also on 10 June, the UNSC passed UNSCR 1244, which welcomed the FRY's acceptance of the "principles on a political solution to the Kosovo crisis" and demanded the FRY's "full cooperation in their rapid implementation." Although 10 June brought an end to the military campaign, significant events occurred during the two-plus months of NATO military action. One week after the start of the campaign, the crisis in the region escalated when on 31 March Serbs captured three U.S. soldiers patrolling the FRY-FYROM border. In April 1999 Serb troops were responsible for the massacre of atl east forty-seven Albanian men, and the forced departure of thousands more, from the town of Djakovica. In response, NATO intensified its campaign of air strikes, bombing roads, bridges, oil production facilities, and other significant targets in the FRY.

  On 27 May 1999 the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) unsealed an indictment accusing Milosevic and four other senior Yugoslav officials of committing numerous war crimes in Kosovo. In passing UNSCR 1244, the UNSC formally declared its adoption of the general principles upon which the political solution to the Kosovo crisis would be based and announced its decision to deploy an international civil presence and an international security presence under UN auspices within Kosovo. The international civil presence was entitled the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),and the international security presence was known as KFOR. On 12 June, synchronized with the departure of the FRY forces, the initial elements of KFOR rolled into Kosovo. This almost 50,000-member international force was to assume the critical peacekeeping mission in Kosovo—code-named Operation Joint Guardian. The U.S. contribution to this force, "Task Force Falcon," operated within one of the five multinational brigades within Kosovo that comprised KFOR—the Multinational Brigade East (MNB(E)), located in southeast Kosovo, bordering the FYROM and the FRY. By 20 June 1999 a majority of the FRY forces had vacated Kosovo, KFOR was well established, and NATO had formally terminated the air campaign.

  Montenegro discussed separating from the FRY. Milosevic's popularity with many Serbs began to plummet over the loss of Kosovo. On 24 September 2000, elections were held in the FRY and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica emerged as the victor. Milosevic refused to release the complete results, however, and instead demanded a runoff election against Kostunica. In response to Milosevic's refusal to step down, massive public protests and demonstrations took place within Serbia. A general strike was called, and over one million people flooded Belgrade, ultimately attacking the Parliament building. Serb security forces either joined the demonstrators or retreated. On 5 October 2000, Milosevic finally conceded the election and stepped down. His Socialist Party, still maintaining a degree of political power, agreed to share power with two opposition parties. Yet after thirteen cruel years and four more Balkan wars, Milosevic's reign had finally come to a close.<sup>[[3]](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/Lessons-Learned_Kosovo/Lessons-Learned_Kosovo.pdf)</sup></sup>

#### NATO targeting/ROE

- To quote at length from Tony Montgomery, Deputy Staff Judge Advocate and Chief, Operations Law at Headquarters EUCOM—on the targeting process:

  "Once the air campaign began, a daily list of proposed new targets (or targets that had been previously reviewed, but additional information had been obtained on) was provided to those working within the targeting group. All target nominations were maintained on a spreadsheet that was electronically updated and available for review on a classified website. I would review the information on the new targets using this list.
Early and unfettered access to data is critical for an effective and efficient target review. During Operation Allied Force, target data was stored on and accessed through our classified computer system. Those with access to the system had the ability to have most of the data on any individual target available for review with just a few keystrokes and mouse clicks. This information consisted of imagery, descriptions of the facility and its functions, analysis on impact (military advantage anticipated) if destroyed, possible collateral damage concerns, and historical information on the target. There, literally at my fingertips, was all the data needed to make a good initial legal evaluation of the target.
The results of the legal reviews were inputted into the targeting process using two primary methods. A spreadsheet format that was provided to those working within the targeting group and updated as new targets were proposed. This spreadsheet contained the target identification information, collateral damage concerns, justification for attack, and a law of war determination or recommendation. This method ensured a permanent record for each target reviewed and provided an easy means of recalling inputs on each target.

  The second method of input was through the collaborative targeting (CTT) sessions. These sessions were an outgrowth of Serbia's failure to acquiesce as quickly as some had hoped would happen. Continuing the conflict translated into a demand for more and better targets, and faster identification. Increasing the pace of target development meant, in part, more people devoted to the task. Throwing more people into the mix initially created additional problems. Groups worked and coordinated target products in a serial fashion. One group would forward its work as e-mail attachments, message traffic, fax, and or phone calls to others with responsibility for different portions of the process. The next group would make changes and forward (or, depending on the changes, return to the first group for reconsideration) to other groups involved in the process. This process continued until the lead group believed the proposed target was ready for decision-maker review. Decision-makers would receive an e-mail with the attached product information and would either accept the product information or send it back for further development.
The disadvantages of this early process were information overload, uncer-tainty, and duplication of effort. Using a serial workflow extended the process timeline and provided more opportunities for confusion, ambiguities and er-rors. There was no consensus among the participants on the rationale for attacking targets. While no illegal targets were attacked during this period, others and myself were concerned that as the tempo increased our ability to provide the necessary oversight would continue to degrade.

  The solution to this serial process was the development of the collaborative targeting sessions. The CTT sessions ensured all targeting organizations had a common understanding of objectives and guidance, built consensus, validated targeting assessments and integrated operational and legal concerns early into the targeting process. Using NetMeeting, a Microsoft product, on the classified internet system, the sessions "virtually" united representatives from commands throughout the theatre and the United States. Similar in concept and format to an internet "chat room" conducted over our classified computer sys-tem, these sessions brought all of the players into the same "virtual" room at the same time. All participants could see the proposed target on their computer monitor, could talk via headsets in real time to each other, and could ask questions and resolve issues. This format enabled everyone's input--in-cluding legal-to get to all those involved at the same time. With all the relevant functional experts gathered together, questions could be asked and resolutions made in minutes rather than days. What might have taken a week before could be done in one night's session. Collaborative targeting sessions were generally conducted every night.

  During a CTT session, the group reviewed proposed targets to determine whether they could be forwarded for approval. For each target, discussion revolved around three issues: 1) the linkage to military effects--the key to gaining legal approval, 2) the collateral damage estimate, and 3) the unintended civilian casualty estimate. The one aspect of this process that consumed most of the time was the collateral damage estimate. Whether it was the nature of the conflict, an outgrowth of the ever increasing visibility of the results of military actions, over sensitivity by political authorities, the desire to make a decision based on some objective "number" (no matter how unscientifically reached or misunderstood) rather than a subjective "value," or a combination of the above, the collateral damage estimate quickly became central to much of the targeting process. An integral part of this estimate was the Tier System. The Tier System was developed prior to Operation Allied Force as an effort to standardize the methodology to be used for estimating collateral damage. Though some aspects of this methodology are classified, the unclassified information provides a general understanding. The system currently has four tiers or levels. Each tier represents an ever-increasing level of analysis. Tier 1 consists of a 1500-foot circle drawn around the outer boundary of a proposed tar-get. If there is no collateral damage concern within that circle, then there is no need to move on to the next tier. Tier 2 involves applying fragmentation data of a specific munition to the actual target. This results in a smaller circle being drawn around the target. If a collateral damage concern still exists, then Tier 3 is used. This involves taking a specific munition, applying its record of accu-racy, along with the possibility of error, and determining the probable or possible extent of collateral damage. Finally, if the level of possible collateral damage is still viewed as unacceptable; and the target in question is deemed of sufficient value, then a Tier 4 analysis, involving computer simulation and modeling can be conducted.

  Here is an illustrative analogy: Tier 1 is like looking at an object with the naked eye, Tier 2 is like using a hand held magnifying glass, Tier 3 is like using a microscope, while Tier 4 is like using a high-powered electron microscope. The tier system is a useful tool that provides a methodology for evaluating the structural collateral damage and possible effects upon any human within the target area. However, it does not provide the actual number of injuries. Also,, just because a target is Tier 1 or Tier 4 does not tell the reviewer anything about the actual value of striking that target within the context of the ongoing campaign. Whether or not destroying a particular target is going to achieve the stated military or political objective is not a part of the tier system analysis. A target may have zero possibility of collateral damage, but if it also has zero impact on the campaign, then bombing that target is wasting resources, putting aircrews and civilians in danger, and possibly violating the law of war. Still, it is very tempting to point to the tier level of some target and make a value judgment solely on those criteria. Returning to the target approval process, once a collaborative targeting session approved a target, it was sent forward to the decision authority. Obtaining approval from both the appropriate authorities within the United States and NATO was required before any target could be attacked. (Note that as I was not involved in the NATO process, my discussions are focused exclusively on the US process.) Upon this final approval, the Joint Task Force (TF) could add the target to the master list and schedule it for attack. However, approval to strike meant much more than just satisfying the rather low thresholds set out by the law of war. The intense concern over the issue of collateral damage meant that targets were approved for strike only at a certain tier level. To achieve that level often meant that only a certain type of munition could be used or the target could only be attacked at certain times of the day. Thus, something as simple as a change in munition could raise the level of collateral damage above what had been approved and, thus, remove a target from the "approved for strike" category.

  As a result, though not listed as an official step in the targeting process, reviewing the daily list of proposed strikes for the next two days became a part of the process. This review was simply a quality check-not because people would intentionally ignore orders, but because people enter the data into the computers, people hit the wrong keys and people make mistakes. A single wrong entry or a miscommunication to the personnel who actually had to execute the mission could mean an attack occurring that had not been approved. This is not saying that a law of war violation would occur, just that a target would be struck in a manner that our civilian authorities had not authorized. In contrast to the hi-tech world of the collaborative targeting sessions, this review was a simple line-by-line comparison of the strike list to the approved target list and the legal review. Usually, this review found no discrepancies; however, on occasion targets listed as approved for attack had not yet been approved at the appropriate level or were being attacked with a munition that raised the possible collateral damage above that approved for the target. When such discrepancies were found, the target would be expedited through the approval process if possible, or the munition would be changed to bring the collateral damage estimate back down. Sometimes this necessitated canceling a strike. After this quality review, the proposed new list of targets would arrive and the process would begin for another day."<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/legalethicalless78wall/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

#### Alleged NATO war crime examples

- A 2000 report, by the UNEP and IAEA experts, examined Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions use in the Balkans found: There was no detectable, widespread contamination of the ground surface by depleted uranium. This means that any widespread contamination is present in such low levels that it cannot be detected or differentiated from the natural uranium concentration found in rocks and soil. The corresponding radiological and toxicological risks are insignificant and even non-existent.

  Detectable ground surface contamination by DU is limited to areas within a few metres of penetrators and localised points of concentrated contamination (‘contamination points’) caused by penetrator impacts. A number of contamination points were identified by the mission but most of these were found to be only slightly contaminated. The majority of the radioactivity was attached to the surrounding asphalt, concrete or soil, with some attached to the loose sand present in some penetrator holes. In many cases, the radioactivity was so low that it was hardly detectable."

  There is no significant risk related to these contamination points in terms of possible contamination of air, water or plants. The only risk of any significance would be that someone touched the contamination point, thereby contaminating their hands (with a risk of subsequent transfer to the mouth), or directly ingested the contaminated soil. However, with reasonable assumptions on intake of soil, the corresponding radiological risk would be insignificant, while from a toxicological point of view, the possible intake might be somewhat higher than the applicable health standards." No DU-contaminated water, milk, objects, or buildings were found."<sup>[[5]](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/finalreport.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On May 7, 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, it was alleged that the US deliberately targeted the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. This was not the case. In summary, there were several crucial errors which led to the Chinese Embassy being struck: There was an error in locating the target. The approach used to attempt to locate the FDSP building was severely flawed. All sources of information used to prevent precisely this type of accident were either inaccurate or incomplete. The review process did not catch the locational error and did not consult any material or any person which could have provided correct information. There was in the immediate aftermath of the bombing some confusion as to what had happened and some of our early public statements were confused and contradictory. To summarize clearly and precisely: the attack on the PRC Embassy was the result of a series of errors that led to the destruction of the PRC Embassy instead of the Serb military target that was intended. The use of a map containing an error--the inaccurate location of the Chinese Embassy--contributed to the tragic mistake--but this was not due solely to a "map error." What went wrong was, first and foremost, that the approach used to locate the Bulevar Umetnosti 2, the address of the FDSP, was severely flawed. Second, the databases used to check and prevent this type of targeting error were also inaccurate, incomplete, and not fully independent. And third, the target review process did not detect the first two mistakes, nor did it involve people and information that could have provided additional data to correct or detect these errors.<sup>[[6]](https://1997-2001.state.gov/policy_remarks/1999/990617_pickering_emb.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001081870.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://irp.fas.org/congress/1999_hr/990722-hamre.htm)</sup></sup> ICTY agreed with these findings, and found no war crime had occurred. ICTY examined a number of high-profile incidents:

  - Grdelica train bombing is not a war crime. Per the independent findings of ICTY, "62. It is the opinion of the committee that the bridge was a legitimate military objective. The passenger train was not deliberately targeted. The person controlling the bombs, pilot or WSO, targeted the bridge and, over a very short period of time, failed to recognize the arrival of the train while the first bomb was in flight. The train was on the bridge when the bridge was targeted a second time and the bridge length has been estimated at 50 meters (Wenz study para 6 g above at p.25). It is the opinion of the committee that the information in relation to the attack with the first bomb does not provide a sufficient basis to initiate an investigation. The committee has divided views concerning the attack with the second bomb in relation to whether there was an element of recklessness in the conduct of the pilot or WSO. Despite this, the committee is in agreement that, based on the criteria for initiating an investigation (see para. 5 above), this incident should not be investigated. In relation to whether there is information warranting consideration of command responsibility, the committee is of the view that there is no information from which to conclude that an investigation is necessary into the criminal responsibility of persons higher in the chain of command."

  - The Attack on the Djakovica Convoy on 14/4/99, ICTY finds, "It is the opinion of the committee that civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident. While there is nothing unlawful about operating at a height above Yugoslav air defences, it is difficult for any aircrew operating an aircraft flying at several hundred miles an hour and at a substantial height to distinguish between military and civilian vehicles in a convoy. In this case, most of the attacking aircraft were F16s with a crew of one person to fly the aircraft and identify the target. As soon as the crews of the attacking aircraft became aware of the presence of civilians, the attack ceased."

  - Further, "NATO intentionally bombed the Radio and TV station and the persons killed or injured were civilians. The questions are: was the station a legitimate military objective and; if it was, were the civilian casualties disproportionate to the military advantage gained by the attack? For the station to be a military objective within the definition in Article 52 of Protocol I: a) its nature, purpose or use must make an effective contribution to military action and b) its total or partial destruction must offer a definite military advantage in the circumstances ruling at the time. The 1956 ICRC list of military objectives, drafted before the Additional Protocols, included the installations of broadcasting and television stations of fundamental military importance as military objectives (para. 39 above). The list prepared by Major General Rogers included broadcasting and television stations if they meet the military objective criteria (para. 38 above). As indicated in paras. 72 and 73 above, the attack appears to have been justified by NATO as part of a more general attack aimed at disrupting the FRY Command, Control and Communications network, the nerve centre and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power, and also as an attempt to dismantle the FRY propaganda machinery. Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable."<sup>[[9]](https://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal)</sup></sup>

### Bosnian War (1992–1995)

#### 1991-1992: War Erupts and the international reaction:

- In June 1991, simmering ethnic tensions within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia came to a peak after the legislatures of Slovenia and Croatia voted overwhelmingly to declare their independence. As an immediate response to their secessions, the Yugoslav government issued a statement claiming such declarations to be "illegal" and "illegitimate" and ordered its military to secure their borders. Two days later, the national Yugoslav People's Army ("JNA"), whose Commander and a majority of whose soldiers were Serbian, responded with force and invaded Slovenia to prevent its separation, but the JNA was met with strong resistance. In Croatia, fighting erupted between Croatian security forces and minority Serb irregulars, who had the backing of the JNA. The Croatian forces quickly lost an estimated one- third of the country to the Serb insurgents. Each of the warring factions, the Serbs, Bosnian Serbs and later the Bosnian Croats, declared regions of territory as "ethnically pure, autonomous" areas under their control, and fiercely fought to protect and expand their holdings.

  In response to the civil unrest in Yugoslavia, the European Community ("EC") convened an emergency meeting of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe ("CSCE"). The CSCE urged the warring factions to accept a cease-fire and sent observers to Yugoslavia to monitor their compliance and troop movement. However, throughout the summer of 1991, while cease-fires were negotiated, signed, and violated, the JNA continued to launch military offensives in Croatia.

  In its third meeting on this subject, the CSCE passed a resolution calling for the imposition of an aims embargo against all parties to the conflict. On September 25, 1991, the Bush Administration, on behalf of the United States, supported the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 713 ("UNSC Res. 713"). The resolution imposed a complete embargo on all weapons and equipment deliveries to the former Yugoslavia—including Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 724, to establish a Sanctions Committee that would monitor compliance with the embargo. Resolution 713, in concert with United National Security Council Resolutions 740 and 787 which addressed the implementation of the embargo, called on all nations to abide by the embargo, but did not legally require countries to enforce the embargo.

  The United Nations arms embargo was intended to contain the war and prevent the entry of additional countries into the conflict. One of the consequences of the embargo, however, was the preservation of Serbian military superiority over the other republics due to the Serbs' alliance with the JNA and the extensive supply of equipment and munitions within the JNA arsenal. Throughout 1991, the JNA continued to attack various Croatian cities. In Zagreb, governmental buildings, including President Tudjman's office, were shelled. In the coastal town of Dubrovnik, the JNA cut off the power and water supplies, and severed telephone links for weeks at a time. In November, the Serbian forces finally left Vukovar, a city of 45,000, in ruins after months of fighting. The first United Nations-sponsored cease-fire went into effect on November 23, 1991 but quickly collapsed, as intense fighting continued elsewhere in Croatia. In January, 1992 the first European Community casualties were reported. Five military observers sent by the CSCE were shot down in their marked helicopter. From this moment, it was evident that a larger international presence was needed to maintain peace in the region. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations sent a team to Croatia to lay the groundwork for the deployment of international peacekeeping troops. With United States support, the passage of United Nations Resolution 743 authorized the establishment of the 14,000-strong United Nations Protection Force ("UNPROFOR") for an initial service of twelve months. The troops were composed of platoons from many nations including Great Britain, France, Canada, Egypt, Malaysia and the Russian Federation and were dispatched throughout the region in areas of heavy fighting and relative calm.

#### 1992-1993: Bosnia Enters the War:

- In early 1992, the battle lines expanded into the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In April, Serb militiamen and the Yugoslav Army launched attacks against Bosnian Government forces after Bosnia became the third country to declare its independence from Yugoslavia. The most ethnically diverse of the former Yugoslav states, Bosnia had been a melting pot of Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Although the Bosnian Government's predominantly Muslim army was larger than the Bosnian Serb Army ("BSA"), the alliance between the Bosnian Serbs and the JNA tipped the balance of firepower heavily in favor of the BSA, which quickly seized more than two-thirds of the territory and surrounded the capital city of Sarajevo. In fact, after the Bosnian Serb Army invaded Sarajevo on May 2, 1992, the front-lines in the Sarajevo suburbs established by the BSA partitioned the city and held on for the rest of the war. The tremendous disparity in weapons is described in a New York Times article that noted: "[T]he Serbian forces in Bosnia have 300 tanks and the Bosnian Muslims just 2. The Serbian forces have 200 armored persoruiel carriers and the Muslims 1 or 2. The Serbian forces have 600 to 800 artillery pieces to two dozen in the hands of the Muslims."


  As these numbers would suggest, Serb forces easily outgunned the Bosnian Muslims, quickly acquired vast expanses of territory and inflicted high numbers of civilian casualties. Unlike the other warring factions whose patrons in Croatia and Serbia provided them with military and financial support, the Bosnian Muslims were forced to look beyond their immediate borders to acquire arms and other support. Despite the international arms embargo, the Bosnian Government forces acquired some small arms by various means including purchasing arms on the international grey market, receiving smuggled weapons from private humanitarian aid organizations, producing some small arms, and receiving clandestine shipments of weapons via an arms pipeline through Croatia. Other countries came to the aid of the Muslims: Turkey and Pakistan smuggled small arms to the Bosnian Muslims; the Sultan of Brunei paid for a shipment of antitank missiles from Malaysia; and Saudi Arabia donated funds to the Bosnian Government to purchase arms from Hungary and Argentina. The materials acquired by the Bosnian Muslims in the early years of the war, however, did little to sustain the troops or mount a strong opposition against the Serb forces. Bosnian President Izetbegovic called upon the United Nations on several occasions to lift the arms embargo and allow his forces access to heavy weapons to defend themselves, but his efforts were unsuccessful.

  The violence escalated during the spring of 1992. Although cease-fires had been negotiated and signed, none had held successfully. Beginning in 1992, successive diplomatic initiatives sponsored by the United Nations and the European Union were rejected. Numerous cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina including Mostar, Gorazde and Sarajevo came under heavy attack from the Bosnian Serb forces, killing many, trapping United Nations peacekeepers, and making the delivery of humanitarian aid nearly impossible. In May, under international pressure and the threat of Western sanctions, the Yugoslav Army announced its withdrawal from the conflict but allowed its soldiers who were bom in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain and fight with their weapons and equipment, thus further solidifying the superiority and military strength of the Bosnian Serbs. In June, Serbian militia forces fiercely attacked Sarajevo, deploying rockets, mortars, and artillery. In July, an international airlift to provide food, medicine and relief supplies to the starving citizens in Sarajevo began. Despite the reported offenses by all factions, in April of 1992 the European Community and the United States formally recognized the countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, and lifted the economic sanctions imposed upon them. In May, these countries gained admission to the United Nations. On May 30, 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed sweeping economic sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ("FRY"), now consisting solely of Serbia and Montenegro, for its role in promoting the creation of an autonomous Serb state and supporting Serbian guerrilla forces, federal Yugoslav army units and the Bosnian Serb Army. Almost one year later in April 1993, these sanctions were further tightened by the United Nations Security Council which banned the transshipment of goods through Serbia and Montenegro and froze financial assets abroad.

  In the summer of 1992, incidents of ethnic cleansing were widely reported. In the northeast Bosnian city of Brcko, Serb forces systematically executed Muslim men in the prison camp of Luka. Inmates were selected to be interrogated, beaten and killed almost every day over a two week period. In Bosanski Samac, Serb military forces overran the city and carried out an orchestrated campaign of terror to force Bosnian Croat and Muslim residents to leave the area. Detention centers and prisoner of war camps also were uncovered. Prisoners freed from the camps described them as places where "beatings and torture are an integral part of the daily regime" and venues of "executions, mass deportations in closed freight cars, forced marches and a regime of starvation and abandonment to the elements." President Izetbegovic charged that Bosnian Muslims were the victims of "genocide" and implored the world community to defend their freedom and their ability to defend themselves as its "duty."  Increasingly, Islamic nations complained that the tepid response against the Serb aggressions by the United Nations and western countries condoned the persecution of Muslims. The forty-seven countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference ("OIC") were naturally sympathetic toward the Bosnian Muslims. The OIC members also were bound by the United  Nations arms embargo, although their degree of adherence to the embargo varied. In December, 1992. the OIC passed a declaration calling for the lifting of the arms embargo. President Izetbegovic responded to outpourings of support from the Islamic community with public accolades and declared that "we consider Iran as our greatest friend in the world." The American public was increasingly sympathetic to efforts to aims the Bosnian Muslims and neither the Bush Administration nor Members of Congress condemned Izetbegovic for expressing such views about Iran. Iran views itself as the "protector of oppressed Muslims worldwide" and was particularly active in its support of the Bosnian Government forces. Beginning in 1992, began implementing plans to send diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian assistance to the Bosnian Muslims to make up for the inability of the United Nations to intervene on behalf of the Bosnian Muslims. Additionally, Iran supplied clandestine military aid and personnel to the Bosnian Government Army.

  In September 1992, western news and Croatian government sources reported the first substantial leak and "one of the most brazen efforts yet to circumvent the arms embargo. An Iranian Boeing 747 had secretly landed in Zagreb, Croatia, carrying more than 4,000 guns; more than one million rounds of ammunition; and forty Iranians in an apparent attempt by the Islamic state to smuggle weapons to Muslim forces. The Iranian 747 flights appeared to confirm rumors that Iran and other Islamic countries had been involved in providing weapons and aid to the Bosnian Muslims in violation of the arms embargo. Although the Muslim forces were desperate for weapons, President Bush responded to the report of the Iranian weapons delivery by officially protesting to Croatia and the Croatian Government impounded the aims. Secretary of State Eagleburger recalled, "We made it very clear that we were adamantly opposed to this going on." U.S. Department of State officials condemned Iran's attempt to skirt the United Nations arms embargo, but acknowledged that previous Iranian flights also may have included illegal arms shipments.

  On 9 October 1992, UN Security Council passed resolution 781, which prohibited unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone, but it did not take action against violators of the resolution. In response to over 500 documented violations, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures "to ensure compliance" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. NATO's Operation Deny Flight, which lasted from April 12, 1993 to Dec 20, 1995, enforced this UNSCR compliance.<sup>[[10]](https://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/459001/operation-deny-flight/)</sup></sup>

#### 1993-1994: Clinton's Bosnian Policy and the Muslim-Croat War:

- During the 1992 Presidential campaign. President Clinton criticized President Bush for taking little action to support the Bosnian Muslims. President Clinton publicly opposed the arms embargo and argued the United States should do more, including conducting air strikes, to protect Bosnia. Once elected, however, Clinton's foreign policy to aid the Bosnian Muslims was constrained diplomatically and militarily. President Clinton faced strong resistance to multilaterally lifting the arms embargo from the European allies, particularly Great Britain and France which feared that a retaliatory strike by the Bosnian Serbs would endanger their troops on the ground. In the absence of necessary international support for a multilateral lift of the embargo. Congress supported a unilateral lift to allow the United States to supply weapons directly to the Muslims. However, the allies opposed unilateral action by the United States vigorously. The Administration shared the allies' opposition to unilateral action out of concern that any Serb retaliation would endanger UNPROFOR troops, that our allies would withdraw their troops, and because unilateral action by the United States would be a direct violation of the international arms embargo. The Administration was concerned about an adverse effect unilateral action would have on the adherence to and the success of other embargoes against Iraq, Libya, and North Korea.


  In early 1993, the Clinton Administration supported a comprehensive peace settlement (the "Vance-Owen plan") sponsored by the two Chairmen of the Peace Conference on former Yugoslavia, United Nations envoy Cyrus Vance and European Community mediator Lord David Owen. The Vance-Owen plan would apportion Bosnia into ten provinces, primarily defined along ethnic lines. The plan would create ten separate provinces, of which three would be defined by a Serb majority, three would have a Muslim majority, two would have a Croat majority, one would be a Croat-Muslim province, and the tenth would be the city of Sarajevo, which would retain a presence of all ethnicities. Throughout the first months of 1993, the two mediators negotiated with the leaders of each warring faction to gamer support for the peace settlement. The Serbs rejected the plan because it required them to return some Muslim pockets of territory they had already conquered and because the Serb provinces would be isolated from each other. Bosnian President Izetbegovic criticized the plan for imposing ethnic partitions across Bosnia, although he felt pressure to accept the plan to gain international approval. In contrast to the other factions, the Croats supported the plan because it fulfilled their objective of creating autonomous Croat provinces that adjoined Croatia and extended into Bosnia. The Bosnian Serb Assembly voted to reject the plan and it lost the support of the United States for several reasons: first, the United States feared that the plan, if adopted, would be unenforceable; second the Bosnian Government continued to strongly criticize the plan; and third, it would have required 50,000 ground troops to enforce and the United States  maintained its reluctance to send peacekeeping troops from the United States armed forces into the region. After abandoning its support for the Vance-Owen plan. President Clinton looked for other ways to support a multi-ethnic state in Bosnia.

  During his first six months in office, President Clinton worked to establish a more active Bosnian policy. In June, Secretary of State Christopher announced the first commitment of United States peacekeeping ground forces to the war, offering 300 United States troops for the UNPROFOR force in Macedonia. The President also worked successfully within the international arena to urge the North Atlantic Council to employ "stronger measures including air strikes" against Bosnian Serb forces (action the NATO Council endorsed). Preparations for the use of NATO air power began immediately after the endorsement. In late April 1993, increasing tensions between the Bosnian Muslims and the Croats erupted into violence. For almost one full year, the Bosnian Muslims found themselves waging wars on two fronts. Ethnic tensions, an influx of refugees who had been "ethnically cleansed" from other cities, and the proximity of Croatian HVO troops and Bosnian Army troops in the same territory caused renegade skirmishes to grow into larger military battles. The war between Bosnian and Croat forces was characterized by surges through Croat villages by the Bosnian Army, burning and looting as it went. For its part, Croatian HVO troops rounded up Muslim men in conquered villages. Incidents of ethnic cleansing, massacres and continued fighting between the Muslims and Croats were widespread.

  At the same time, the Bosnian Serb Army continued to advance against the Muslim forces. In response to the ruthless attack on the Bosnian city of Srebrenica and its subsequent surrender to the Serb forces in April 1993, and to heavy fighting elsewhere, in June 1993, the United Nations Security Council parsed Resolution 836 expanding the mandate for the UNPROFOR troops to include protection of six Bosnian "safe areas." The areas included Sarajevo, Bihac, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Gorazde and Zepa and allowed "all necessary measures" including air power to support UNPROFOR in its protection of the safe areas. The designation of the safe areas required UNPROFOR to progress from peacekeeping to peace-enforcement in these areas and marked the first time in the conflict that the United Nations relinquished its strict neutrality and committed to the protection of one side over the other. In reality, however, the declared "safe areas" were far from safe. As 1993 continued, prospects for peace in the region remained slim. United States diplomats attempted to negotiate a cease-fire and union between the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims in August 1993, but provocations and broken promises on both sides caused the fighting to continue into the fall and winter. In October, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution extending the mandate for the UNPROFOR forces until March 31, 1994. In November, Bosnian Croat shelling destroyed the famous Old Bridge in Mostar, an international landmark built by the Ottoman Turks in 1566 and a symbol of past unity in a town where the ethnically-diverse residents had lived in mutual tolerance. Under pressure from the United States and other nations that advocated the lifting of the arms embargo, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution on December 20, 1993, urging the Security Council to lift the embargo on the Bosnian government. However, the Security Council did not have the votes to enact such a measure.

  In 1995, during the Bosnian war, Operation Deny Flight transitioned to Operation Deliberate Force, after artillery shells killed 38 civilians and injured 85 others, by Serb forces. The air campaign resulted in few civilian casualties, and ended the civil conflict. Indeed, experts have documented the Operation's efforts to avoid civilian casualties and applaud its efforts and results, "constraints on force application entailed avoiding collateral effects and unintended consequences that would be counterproductive to the political peace process. This effort to avoid collateral and unintended damage extended not only to the surrounding physical targets but also to concerns about fratricide, refugees, and noncombatant civilian casualties. The need for precision offensive air operations (OAS) platforms and weapons to limit collateral damage while accomplishing mission objectives became an overriding concern during the Balkans air campaign. Thus, precision-guided munitions (PGM) became the overwhelming weapons of choice during air strike operations. Indeed, Deliberate Force became the first air campaign in history to employ more precision-guided bombs and missiles than unguided ones."<sup>[[11]](https://www.airforcemag.com/article/1097deliberate/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0074_OWEN_DELIBERATE_FORCE.pdf)</sup> 

#### Negotiating the Federation Agreement:

- In February of 1994, Bosnian Serbs attacked a crowded market square in Sarajevo, killing sixty-eight people, wounding more than 200 and sparking worldwide outrage. The Clinton Administration responded to the incident by calling for NATO air strikes against Serb gun  emplacements and encouraging the Muslims and Croats to present a unified defense against the Serbs. The Serb forces agreed to comply with the NATO demands, thereby avoiding the threatened air strikes. The front lines did not remain quiet for long. Later in February 1994, the first combat action in the 45-year-old history of NATO was initiated when United States fighter pilots downed four Bosnian Serb planes illegally flying in a no-fly zone.


  Throughout the Muslim-Croat conflict, mediators from the United States sought to exert pressure on both sides to enter into peace negotiations. In February, the United Nations issued an ultimatum to Croatia to pull its army out of Bosnia or face sanctions and world isolation. The threat worked.  Croatia agreed to withdraw its army and commence serious negotiations for a Federation. By the end of February, the Bosnians and Croats were en route to Washington and, over the next four days, negotiated a draft agreement. Despite the year long violence between the Muslims and Bosnian Croats, the two parties signed an accord establishing a fragile alliance. President Clinton hailed the pact as "one of the first clear signals that parties to this conflict are willing to end the violence and begin a process of reconstruction." The impact of the Federation Agreement was instrumental to the survival of the Bosnian Muslims until the signing of the Dayton Accords the following year. The most important and immediate consequence of the Agreement was to enable the Bosnian Army to focus its energy on  the war with Serb forces, and to create a Muslim-Croatian unified defense to put additional pressure on the Serbs to negotiate a peace settlement. The Bosnian Army's supply of weapons and munitions increased as a result of access to Croatian weapons caches and the arms pipeline was reopened through Croatian territory. The alliance also enhanced the delivery of needed humanitarian aid to Muslim enclaves.

  Despite the momentum provided by successful negotiations to establish the Muslim-Croat Federation, peace with the Bosnian Serbs was not forthcoming. The Serb forces continued to hold seventy percent of the territory in Bosnia. In April 1994, gunfire and explosions erupted again in Sarajevo. At the same time, the Serbs launched attacks against three United Nations "safe havens. Srebrenica and Zepa fell quickly. Gorazde, a city of 65,000 strategically located between two large Serb-held towns in the Drina Valley, was subjected to a devastating siege. The Bosnian Serbs were attempting to consolidate their territory in the event that a quickly-moving peace process would freeze existing boundaries. United Nations officials, however, interpreted the vigorous attacks on the cities in northern Bosnia as retaliation against the Federation agreement. 

  The siege of Gorazde was particularly harsh. United States Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia Charles Redman characterized the attack as "very, very brutal ... we simply had a bunch of helpless civilians being pounded at point blank range by Serbian tanks." At the height of the assault, Serb gunners were hitting the city an average of once every twenty seconds for an entire day. Bosnian President Izetbegovic responded with another international call for weapons to be used in self-defense. The events in Gorazde made absolutely clear the inability of the UNPROFOR forces to protect the "safe areas" under the existing rules of engagement. The situation was becoming increasingly dangerous to citizens of Gorazde, the international relief agency personnel and the United Nations personnel in the city.

  UNPROFOR Commander General Rose demanded Serbian General Mladic put a stop to the attacks on Gorazde or face NATO action, but the attacks continued. In what President Clinton described as "a clear call to the Serbs to pull back from Gorazde and resume the negotiations," NATO jets began to carry out air strikes against the Serb forces with increasing frequency and intensity to protect the United Nations personnel and civilians. Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic retaliated by detaining United Nations troops and officials, banning American  journalists from Serb territories and declaring United Nations Commander Rose persona non grata. The retaliation by the Serb forces hardened allied opposition to a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. Bosnian Serbs also blocked United Nations relief convoys from bringing needed food and medicine to Gorazde. Near the end of April, Bosnian Serb troops began to comply with NATO deadlines to withdraw their heavy weapons and air strikes diminished. While the Bosnian Serbs unleashed fierce attacks on the "safe areas" and other Bosnian enclaves, and the number of civilian casualties skyrocketed, the United States Congress hotly debated the issues of the arms embargo. During the spring of 1994, both Houses voted to mandate the lifting of the embargo. The disproportionate impact of the arms embargo had become increasingly clear to the Administration, Congress, and the American public. Moreover, the new Federation Agreement between the Croats and Muslims offered the first real opportunity to forge a peace in the region. This is the moment in the history of the Balkan conflict when the United States Ambassador responded to the President of Croatia that he had "no instructions" with respect to either the United States would object if Croatia allowed arms shipments from other countries to pass through its territory into Bosnia.

##### The Fall 1994 Initiative

- During the summer of 1994, the United States undertook an analysis of a possible covert action to arm the Bosnian Muslims. This option was rejected, however, because the United States determined it impossible to sustain such an activity for any extended period of time. In the fall of 1994, the United States also considered whether third countries should be encouraged to transship arms through Croatia to Bosnia. The "third country option" was initiated, in part, to respond to a proposal made by the Bosnian government to suspend its demands for lifting the embargo in return for an increase in arms shipments. This proposal also was rejected due to the risk that the allies would discover the arrangement and accuse the United States of a breach of the arms embargo.

  During the fall of 1994, individuals within the CIA nevertheless became suspicious that U.S. officials, including Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the new Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, were involved in a covert program to provide arms to the Bosnian Muslims for which a Presidential finding as required by law had not been made. The [redacted] reported on a series of incidents during the summer and fall of 1994 that he thought suggested senior U.S. officials were involved in such activity. Individuals within the CIA's Operations and Intelligence Directorates independently developed and reported to CIA leadership their suspicions about the activities of U.S. officials with regard to arms deliveries to the Bosnian Muslims. These suspicions were based in part on reporting by the [redacted] of intelligence and in part on comments and rumors conveyed to him by the Deputy Chief of Mission at Embassy Zagreb (the "DCM"). In September and October 1994, various intelligence sources incorrectly reported that senior officials of the United States government were engaged in active negotiations with third countries to provide arms to the Bosnians. In reality, United States government officials were simply exploring options of whether and how the Bosnians might be armed. The exploration of options was, in part, a result of the pressure the Congress was putting on the Administration to lift the embargo.

##### Communications and Miscommunications at the CIA

- Communications between the senior officials of the Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency over the United States Government policy and conduct in the Balkans lapsed in April/May 1994 and in September/October 1994. On May 5, at the weekly meeting of Secretary of Stale Christopher and DCI Woolsey (also attended on this occasion by Deputy Secretary Talbott), the DCI described a request Ambassador Galbraith had made of an ICR in Croatia. The DCI said Ambassador Galbraith had asked an ICR to [redacted] that the United States would, in effect, look the other way with regard to the transshipment of arms through Croatian-held territory to Bosnia. DCI Woolsey's description of the Ambassador's request set off a chain of miscommunication and misunderstanding. Deputy Secretary Talbott knew that Ambassador Galbraith had been instructed to tell the Croatians that he had "no instructions." When he heard the words "look the other way." he was therefore surprised. In fact, Ambassador Galbraith  did  not tell the Croatians that the United States Government would look the other way. The DCIs characterization of the message Ambassador Galbraith had transmitted incorrectly left Deputy Secretary Talbott with the impression that the Ambassador had expressed United States support for the transshipment of arms to the Croatian government. The use of the words "look the other way" by the DCI led Deputy Secretary Talbott to express concern because it was not consistent with the direction given to Ambassador Galbraith. The "no instructions" language was formulated to avoid putting the United States government in the position of either supporting or opposing the transshipment of arms. The "no instructions" response is very difference from the language that the DCI attributed to the Ambassador, ie, saying that the United States would, in effect, look the other way. In fact. Ambassador Galbraith had made his request of an ICR in Croatia so that an earlier and incorrect description of United States policy conveyed to a Croatian official could be corrected.

  For its part, [redacted] neglected to inform an ICR in Croatia that Ambassador Galbraith had been instructed to tell the Croatian government that he had "no instructions" regarding the transshipment of arms across Croatian-held territory to Bosnia. The failure of [redacted]  to inform the ICR of the "no instructions" response caused the ICR to continue to assume through mid-November 1994 that United States policy was to enforce the embargo against third country transshipments of aims through Croatian-held territory to Bosnia and that Ambassador Galbraith and other United States Government officials were taking actions contrary to that policy.

##### The May 1994 Convoy Incident

- The overriding objective on the ground in Bosnia in 1994 and throughout most of the war was to provide food, clothing and medical supplies to the Bosnians. The primary means of delivering these supplies was relief convoys. The convoys numbered in the thousands and were often stopped by Bosnian Croats to harass the Muslims. Often, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees which administered the United Nations convoy relief operation would contact United States Government officials for assistance in gaining the release of detained convoys. On many occasions. United States officials would intercede to expedite the progress of these convoys. Intelligence and other sources raised suspicions about whether some relief convoys may have carried weapons in addition to humanitarian supplies. The Minority believes that some convoys did carry weapons, but found no evidence to suggest that any United States Government official knowingly assisted in the relief of such a convoy. The Minority concludes that Special Envoy Redman did not intervene knowingly to have an arms convoy released. Some circumstantial evidence suggests that Special Envoy Redman may have made a call from Vienna regarding a convoy during the first week of May 1994. The source of that evidence, however, testified that Special Envoy Redman had no knowledge or awareness of any arms on the convoy. Further, no evidence of any kind exists to suggest that Ambassador Galbraith or any other United States personnel facilitated the release of this convoy or any prior or subsequent arms convoys.

  The Minority concludes that had it not been for this rampant speculative reporting, the May 1994 convoy would have been no more significant than the thousands of other convoys that traversed the region during the war. The allegations of misconduct and possible covert action were wholly unsupported by any evidence and should not have been accorded the level of significance that was afforded them. The Minority also believes that the CIA must do a better job of distinguishing between speculation and gossip in intelligence reporting. The speculation by the DCM about Special Envoy Redman was rumor and gossip, not intelligence.


##### Alleged Meetings between Ambassador Galbraith and the Muslim Cleric Omerbasic

- The transshipment of arms from Iran and other Islamic countries to Bosnia through Croatia undoubtedly involved the work of middlemen, arms dealers and other shadowy figures. The shadowy figure who emerged in the Select Subcommittee investigation was Imam Omerbasic, the religious leader of the Muslims in Zagreb. The Minority shares the belief that Imam Omerbasic played a role in arranging arms shipments to the Bosnian Muslims. However, the Minority strongly objects to any effort to connect the Imam's role to any United States Government official. For example, Imam Omerbasic met with Senator Bob Dole who also was sympathetic to the plight of the Bosnian Muslims. Testimony and documents reviewed by the Select Subcommittee staff offer no evidence to suggest that a secret contact or conversation between the Ambassador and the cleric ever occurred and that supplying Bosnia with arms was ever discussed.

  In response to a question posed to the cleric asking if the Ambassador ever was involved in working to arm the Bosnian Muslims, the cleric replied that "unfortunately that was not the case." The Imam explained that if the Muslims had received weapons from the United States, they would have not have suffered as many casualties. The cleric went on to state that he had no knowledge of any United States officials involved in arming Bosnia. That Imam Omerbasic expressed disappointment that the United States had not supplied arms to the Bosnian Muslims, further casts doubt on the possibility that Ambassador Galbraith or any other United States  official ever had made an offer of arms.

  The record is clear. The Ambassador first met Mr. Omerbasic in July 1993 on a courtesy call. Anns were not discussed. The second possible contact between the Ambassador and the cleric with respect to which none of the participants - including the cleric - has a clear memory of who attended, was a social event covered by the press in which no discussion of arms occurred. Two years later in May 19%, when the new Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Finn made a courtesy call on the Imam, the cleric noted that he was the first official from the Embassy the cleric had met with in two years. In fact, the speculative, incomplete and inaccurate nature of the reporting created suspicions within the CIA that a covert operation, spearheaded by Ambassador Galbraith, was underway. This was wildly disproportionate to the facts.

##### Mystery Flights into Tuzla

- Among the most publicized allegations of United States involvement in arming the Bosnian Muslims involved the February 1995 reports of United States cargo aircraft landing at Tuzla airport. These reports were investigated at the time they occurred by NATO, the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. No evidence confirming the reports was discovered.

  The reports of phantom C-130 cargo planes escorted by fighter jets first surfaced in the public media in February 1995. According to press accounts," United Nations peacekeepers reported hearing and seeing cargo planes escorted by fighter aircraft flying over the Tuzla airport on the nights of February 10 and 12, 1995. On the evening of February 10, 1995. a patrol went to investigate the alleged flight but retreated after being fired upon by Bosnian Muslim forces. Although no cargo or other aircraft actually were observed on the ground at any of the four airstrips which comprise the Tuzla airport region, the press reported speculation that the United States was involved. Press speculation about a United States role in the flights persisted because it was believed that the C-130s may have been conducting maneuvers such as air drops of high technology weapons that could have only been performed by only a few countries such as the United States, France, and Britain. On both occasions, NATO, the entity responsible for maintaining the no-fly zone over Bosnia, found nothing to verify that the flights had taken place. The speculation continued, however, because the United States had primary responsibility for the monitoring of the no-fly zone via radar and other aircraft and thus presumably could have allowed the flights to proceed "undetected." Some alleged that the United States also would have been in the position to know when radar coverage of the Tuzla area would be diminished sufficiently to permit clandestine flights. On February 24, 1995, the Russian delegation to the United Nations Security Council asked for a formal report from NATO and the United Nations on the mystery flights. NATO subsequently launched a military investigation into the matter. Military investigators traveled to Tuzla and interviewed eye witnesses in order to reconstruct events. The military investigation concluded that the flights observed by the Norwegian members of UNPROFOR on February 10 and 12, 1995, were attributed to "scheduled . . . NATO flights." NATO released the results of its investigation on March 1, 1995. Despite the NATO investigation, questions continued to linger within European circles about the Tuzla flights and possible United States involvement. Press reports continued sporadically throughout 1995, quoting unidentified U.N. officials alleging that the flights "had been a weapons delivery" and that "the United States had approved of the. . . operations."

  According to the report prepared by the NATO investigative team, beginning at approximately 5:45 p.m. on February 10. UNPROFOR personnel located in Sector Northeast reported the sighting of a transport type aircraft with two fighter escorts." According to the Air Operations Coordination Center ("AOCC") in Sarajevo, these planes were seen landing at the Tuzla West airstrip. Approximately one hour later, U.N. monitors also began receiving reports of fixed wing activity around Tuzla. In all, four reports of fixed wing activity were lodged on February 10, 1995. The second report occurred in the early evening of Sunday, February 10, 1995. UNPROFOR personnel began reporting "jet noise" over Tuzla. Reports of fixed wing aircraft filtered into NATO and United Nations monitoring centers for nearly an hour. While attempting to ascertain if a plane had landed at that Tuzla West airstrip, a team of Nordic UNPROFOR troops was surrounded by Bosnian forces and prohibited from examining the airstrip.

  The Select Subcommittee reviewed documentation provided by the Department of Defense, including the final report issued by the NATO investigative team, and interviewed numerous individuals will, knowledge of the rumours and investigations of them. The Minority concludes that no credible evidence exists to substantiate the claim that the United States delivered arms to the Bosnian Muslims via cargo flights on February 10 or 12, 1995. 

##### The missile incident

- The incident that appears to have attracted the most concern involves a shipment of missiles from Iran that was stopped in Croatia. The Croatian authorities asked the United States Government to inspect the missiles for chemical warheads. The Defense Attache at Embassy Zagreb, accompanied by two different intelligence officers, inspected the missiles on two separate occasions. The officials concluded that the missiles did not contain chemical warheads. No credible evidence to indicate any other United States involvement in the missile shipment was determined. The Majority alleges that Ambassador Galbraith was involved in pressuring the Croats to release the missiles to the Bosnians. The sources for the allegation are two Croat officials whose credibility and veracity have been challenged in a general way by a number of other Americans, and whose account of this event is inconsistent the the account of all other United States officials involved with the missile inspection. In a May 21, 1996 article. The Los Angeles Times reported that in September 1995 the United States was involved in the inspection of a shipment of missiles destined for Bosnia from Iran. The article alleged that United States officials had gone beyond passive acknowledgment of the arms pipeline to a direct role in facilitating the arms flow. The article claimed that the CIA and the military, after overcoming their alarm at the weapon's potential permitted them to be released to the Bosnians under the direction of Ambassador Galbraith. The Select Subcommittee undertook a detailed investigation of these allegations. Staff reviewed official reports and documents generated about the shipment, including the cable traffic of both the Defense Attache and the [redacted] in Zagreb; interviewed numerous witnesses with first hand knowledge of the events; and reviewed media accounts and Congressional hearing testimony.

  The Minority concludes, in direct contradiction to the findings of the Majority, that the inspection of the missiles by United States military and intelligence personnel was conducted for the sole purpose of determining whether the missiles were armed with chemical warheads. The Minority also concludes that the inspection was consistent with the terms and conditions of the Nunn-Mitchell amendment. The Minority concludes further that the inspection was appropriate for this limited purpose in order to protect United States civilian and military personnel from the risks of introducing chemical weapons into the region. The Minority found no credible or substantive evidence that Ambassador Galbraith. the [redacted] or any other United States government official facilitated or encouraged the release of these missiles. The Intelligence Oversight Board ("lOB") which had concluded in May 1995 that no United States covert activity to arm the Bosnian Muslims had occurred in 1994, initiated an informal review of the "missile allegation" as a supplement to its report. Based on interviews with key United States individuals, the lOB determined that no evidence existed to suggest that Ambassador Galbraith, [redacted]  or any other United States official pressured the Croatians to release the missiles.

#### Bosnian Train and Equip program, July 09, 1996
- Dayton Agreement Provisions to Protect IFOR:

  "Consistent with the United States policy of isolating Iran, and in response to specific concerns about the safety of United States troops, the United States has been particularly diligent in making sure the Dayton signatories comply with the so-called "foreign forces" provision in the peace agreement." This provision requires the removal of foreign forces from Bosnia, a catch-all phrase meant to include the volunteer Mujahideen forces, foreign Islamic fundamentalist forces, the Iranian military, and other extreme elements who had come to the region during the conflict to volunteer with the warring factions. As leverage to ensure compliance with this provision, the United States has linked the removal of foreign forces, in particular Iranian volunteer forces, with the receipt of United States aid. This strategy has been successful, and although the Bosnian Government was slow to pressure the foreign fighters to leave their territory after the Dayton Agreement was signed, it has made significant strides in the ensuing months. On June 7, 1996, President Clinton provided certification that the number of foreign forces remaining in Bosnia was low enough to trigger the United States "equip and train program" to proceed."

#### Conclusion on aid allegations

  Several investigations were conducted to examine the charges. In total, millions of classified records were examined, many hundreds of individuals interviewed and cross-examined. The following are the core conclusions of these independent & authoritative studies. Above are, are specific areas of concern, to clarify the confusing record left in the wake of sensationalist headlines and conspiracy theories:

- "From the outset of the Clinton Administration, it was United Slates policy neither to oppose nor support third party arms transfers to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This policy was embodied In the "no instructions" response to the Croatian Government's question on the United States view on the transshipment of arms. It served several important United States interests, and helped establish conditions on the ground that pointed the way to peace. The United States took no action to aid arms transfers to the former Yugoslavia. At no time did any United States government official take any action to supply arms to any country or entity covered by the U.N. arms embargo. At no time did any United States government official undertake any covert action to supply arms to any country or entity covered by the embargo, or to encourage, aid or assist in the shipment or transfer of arms to any country in the former Yugoslavia. No United States Government official coordinated, cooperated, conspired with or suggested to the Bosnian Muslims, the Government of Croatia, or the Bosnian Croats that the United States be asked to state its view of the transshipment of arms. United States Government officials directed Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith to respond that he had "no instructions" when asked for the reaction of the United States government to the transshipment of arms through Croatia to Bosnia by the government of Croatia. Ambassador Galbraith carried out his directions correctly and promptly. There was no "greenlight" for Iran.<sup>[[13]](https://archive.org/details/bosnia-arms)</sup></sup> 

- "The Committee found no evidence that the United States ever provided such support or any quid pro quo to Croatia, or encouraged any country to provide arms or military assistance in violation of the arms embargo, despite the fact that on September 27, 1994, Bosnia did publicly call for a United Nations resolution lifting the arms embargo that would incorporate a six-month delay."<sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/united-states-actions-regarding-iranian)</sup></sup>

- "Based on the facts developed during the Committee's inquiry into the matter of the shipment of Iranian arms into Bosnia, we believe that the following conclusions are inescapable: (1) the United States government undertook no covert action to ship weapons to Bosnia or Croatia; (2) No U.S. official directed, controlled or facilitated the shipment of Iranian arms to Bosnia or Croatia; (3) No U.S. official violated U.S. law relating to covert action, intelligence activities, or notifications to Congress; (4) No discrepancies justifying a criminal investigation exist in the testimony of the witnesses who appeared before the Committee; and (5) Nothing in the Committee's inquiry contradicts the findings of the 1995 and 1996 investigations of the President's Intelligence Oversight Board."<sup>[[15]](https://archive.org/details/investigation-into-iranian-arms-shipment)</sup></sup>
