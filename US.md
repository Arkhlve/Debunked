# Fact-checking and debunking the list of alleged atrocities committed by the United States
[The Bullshit asymmetry principle, or Brandolini's law](https://www.nature.com/articles/540171a):
> The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

The purpose of this authoritative, meticulously documented resource is to provide an invaluable 'living document' that officially fact-checks and outright refutes allegations made by political pundits and conspiracy theorists (from across the political spectrum), that various US foreign and domestic policy actions were 'atrocities'. This correction and refutation is achieved via a close, and critical examination of primary source records—as well as peer-reviewed, scholarly literature from world-leading experts in their corresponding fields. The issue with lists that claim to archive US "atrocities" is that they're created often by conspiracy theorists,<sup>[[1]](https://imgur.com/a/ipTt002)</sup></sup> who predominantly cite sensational headlines that are written by layman who either have strong biases, or simply lack familiarity with the subject matter to understand nuance and key information that'd be adverse to their conclusion. They simply do not stand up to rudimentary factual or legal scrutiny.

Some readers will find this Repository clash with what they think they know to be true, and as a result, may commit a number of logical fallacies in order to deal with the cognitive dissonance. Tragic, but to be expected in today's disinformation/fake-news rich environment. Truth-decay must be stymied, however. I encourage reading the material from a fresh canvas.

A note on sources: This repository only cites peer-reviewed, mainstream academic literature from world-leading scholars, that form a consensus in various fields, respectively. It also cites authoritative contemporaneous records to events, rather than, say, cable reporting. Other primary source records include a multitude of independent investigations carried out by various oversight bodies that overlap in findings (forming a clear consensus of fact) and have withstood the test of time. These documents are always far superior to other accounts (such as news papers, NGOs, etc due to the fact they're conducted by expert investigators, who interview and cross-reference all relevant testimony, and examine the full documentary record—thus leading to a deeply penetrating, critical investigation. Further, many such oversight reports also include a review of open-source material, to be as thorough as possible. They, of course, written by people like you and I, and are not infallible. Often, when such investigations are erroneous, they're re-examined in other follow-up reviews that address the previously identified issue. In almost every such record, you'll find a highly self-critical, and impartial investigation. Some herein shown for the first time, and others, while public for many years—were forgotten to time.

Not all governments are equally transparent or accountable.

__Disclaimer:__ This project isn't an attempt to whitewash or deny when actual atrocities, or wrong-doing by the US Government, has occurred. One can simply look at racial segregation, slavery, or the early treatment of natives, as some examples (hence not covered here). However, by and large, the US has maintained a very good track record on human rights. When it falters, accountability swiftly follows.

_Definition: An extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury._

_[Legal Definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825130159/https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.49_Framework%20of%20Analysis%20for%20Atrocity%20Crimes_EN.pdf): The  term  “atrocity  crimes”  refers  to  three  legally  defined  international  crimes:    genocide, crimes against  humanity  and  war  crimes._ 

"Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." 
 
   – President Barack  Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016

- On July 12, 2021, the Biden Administration issued its report to Congress Pursuant to Section 5 of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-441). "The Biden Administration is committed to promoting democratic values that underpin a stable international system critical to freedom, prosperity, and peace.  This Administration will defend and protect human rights around the world, and recognizes the prevention of atrocities is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility. This report highlights countries of concern and whole-of-government efforts undertaken by the Atrocity Early Warning Task Force to prevent and respond to atrocities."<sup>[[1]](https://www.state.gov/2021-report-to-congress-pursuant-to-section-5-of-the-elie-wiesel-genocide-and-atrocities-prevention-act-of-2018)</sup></sup>

- In 2016 and 2015, then-CIA Director John Brennan confirmed CIA's direct role in applying pressure to foreign Governments and individuals to abide by human rights, otherwise face consequences such as termination of cooperation. He confirmed that the CIA has followed through on its word, due to CIA's concerns.<sup>[[1]](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160713_cia_brennan_transcript.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/150806%20DCIA%20Brennan%20letter%20to%20Wyden[2].pdf)</sup></sup> This is in line with decades of CIA practice (see Western Hemisphere section).

## Alleged Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries.
This is misleading and in factual error.
  - Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present.
  - Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities. An installation may consist of one or more sites.  

    The DoD has presence in only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sits as of 2018. This is at the full [consent of host countries.<sup>[[1]](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- US Military presence abroad is popular among locals of host countries, where economies and stability increase.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/outside-the-wire-us-military-deployments-and-public-opinion-in-host-states/BEC8A7BA48C9CF5B82B100CCC4CFA56E)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR518.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X17738219?ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys&af=R)</sup></sup> 

- A comprehensive examination of 164 countries for the years 1981 to 2005 concludes, "the United States is likely to engage in military campaigns for humanitarian reasons that focus on human rights protection rather than for its own security interests such as democracy promotion or terrorism reduction... the present research finds that, beneath the greater consciousness concerning promotion of democracy and combating terrorism, human rights abuses emerge as the consistent trait among states that experience US military intervention... The empirical evidence of this study leads us to believe that the United States has a sustained interest in promoting human rights abroad rather than exclusively pursuing its security interests. This finding therefore lends credence to the Liberal Hypothesis about human rights, especially in contrast to the Realist Hypothesis regarding terrorism. This finding is also in line with the official position of US Department of State: ‘‘The protection of fundamental human rights was a foundation stone in the establishment of the United States over 200 years ago. Since then, a central goal of U.S. foreign policy has been the promotion of respect for human rights, as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.’’ Of course, our assessment counteracts the widespread popular belief regarding US intervention as self-serving adventurism."<sup>[[1]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002714560350)</sup></sup>

- "Over the past two years, I interviewed more than 130 officials about the century-long history of covert electoral interference, or concealed foreign efforts to manipulate democratic votes of succession. My interviewees included eight former CIA directors and many more CIA officers, as well as directors of national intelligence, secretaries of state, national security advisers, a KGB general, and a former U.S. president. I learned that in the twenty-first century, Washington’s senior-most national security officials have considered using the CIA to interfere in foreign elections at least twice. In one instance—in Serbia in 2000—debate turned into action, as the CIA spent millions of dollars working against the tyrant Slobodan Milosevic. In the other—in Iraq in 2005—the CIA stood down. In both instances, U.S. policymakers weighed the potential benefits of covert action against the perceived risks. These behind-the-scenes stories reveal why, contrary to Putin’s claims, Washington, unlike Moscow, has moved away from the practice of covert electoral interference."<sup>[[1]](https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/20/rigged-details-long-history-russian-and-us-electoral-interference)</sup></sup>

- Congress has in fact often authorized hostilities by legislative measures other than formal “declarations of war” since the days of the early republic, and many after the War Powers Resolution.<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/file/19306/download)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/WCPD-1999-03-29/pdf/WCPD-1999-03-29-Pg527.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Middle East

- It has been alleged that the US sanctions medicine, among other humanitarian aid, to Iran—however, America has never sanctioned humanitarian aid, ever.<sup>[[1]](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/iran-sanctions)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.state.gov/iran-sanctions/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=RS20871)</sup></sup>

- Afghan intelligence units, referred to as "zero units," with alleged connections to the CIA, have been target of a massive, "systematic disinformation campaign designed to discredit them because of the threat they posed to Taliban rule.” As noted above, CIA has a "direct role in applying pressure to foreign Governments and individuals to abide by human rights, otherwise face consequences such as termination of cooperation." And that, "the CIA has followed through on its word, due to CIA's concerns."<sup>[[1]](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160713_cia_brennan_transcript.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/150806%20DCIA%20Brennan%20letter%20to%20Wyden[2].pdf)</sup></sup>

- On Sept. 29 2022, the Department of Defense reported 12 civilian deaths and approximately five civilian injuries in its Annual Report on Civilian Casualties in Connection With United States Military Operations for 2021. Deaths and injuries from Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq and Syria, Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan, and U.S. Africa Command activity in Somalia. Civilian deaths in Afghanistan comprised the entirety of reported deaths for 2021, amounting to 12 killed and two injured, while the department reported no deaths and three injuries in Somalia. According to the report, there were no deaths or injuries in connection with U.S. military operations in Iraq or Syria, though it did update its estimate for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to include an additional 18 injured and 10 killed as a part of the Combined Joint Task Force OIR—an operation meant to counteract activities of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in Iraq and Syria.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/27/2003086234/-1/-1/1/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2021.PDF)</sup></sup>

- On the 1st of August, 2022, the US carried out a successful drone strike against Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan. There were 0 civilian casualties as a result.<sup>[[1]](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3114362/us-drone-strike-kills-al-qaida-leader-in-kabul/)</sup></sup>

- On February 3rd, 2022, US troops conducted a raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. Civilians were killed as a result of him detonating a bomb, killing his family. US Special forces had tried to call for his surrender and offered him a path to survive.<sup>[[1]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/News-Article-View/Article/2927256/mckenzie-says-isis-leader-who-died-during-us-raid-was-evil/)</sup></sup>

- On December 18, 2021, NYT released hundreds of CIVCAS reports obtained through FOIA. Despite media coverage, a close examination of the files reveals nothing new, broadly. But does offer superior information into specific strikes media/NGOs either covered (or didn't). The core conclusions are reached upon a thorough review of the files:
  - Most CIVCAS allegations were self-reported, long before or even with no media coverage.
  - Vast majority of CIVCAS allegations coming from media/NGOs were off be a large order of magnitude, in: Dates, locations, and assessed number of people killed/injured, and causes. Most had no CIVCAS, buttressing official statements. 
  - Confirms findings in CIVCAS reviews that SOPs, doctrine, policy, and laws (domestic & international), etc were followed in both dynamic and deliberate strikes. From strike authority to CIVCAS mitigation efforts.<sup>[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/civilian-casualty-files.html)</sup></sup>

  Counter to media allegations, the July 19, 2016 airstrike in Tokhar, a village in Manbij, Syria did not cause the deaths of 80 to 160 civilians. While the exact number is indeterminate, pre-strike footage confirms possibly 7 to 24 civilians. All ROEs and IHL were adhered. Nor negligence or wrong-doing. <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20050510232110/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=7293)</sup></sup> Further, counter to the list's claim that, "The reports reveal that the US military deliberately chose to drop bombs on children they saw on camera... knowingly bombed children playing on a roof." The underlying internal document shows that children were observed the day before the strike—and that no children were seen prior to pre-strike soak of target. Only one child was wounded. Those killed were all adult ISIS. Most likely family of the child.<sup>[[3]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/c-1-30-17-iraq/6747b75e76514e83/full.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  Note: Some files have been released previously under FOIA.

- On December 2, 2021, an independent Inspector General review, dated May 2021, was declassified, it found CENTCOM's kinetic targeting procedures (intelligence vetting, Civilian Casualty mitigation, and approval authority) were adhered to, in operations in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Libya.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Dec/10/2002907413/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2021-084%20(REDACTED).PDF)</sup></sup> 

- On November 13, 2021, the New York Times ran a story that alleged there was a cover-up of a March 18, 2019 airstrike in Baghouz (Baghuz), Syria, from a F-25E. Additionally, NYT alleged that over 80 civilians were killed. However, in reality, an independent panel found this airstrike resulted in only 4 civilians killed. One female and three children. 15 civilians were wounded 11 women and four children.<sup>[[1]](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3034995/pentagon-press-secretary-john-f-kirby-holds-a-press-briefing/)</sup></sup> The NYT article is riddled with red flags and omissions to bias in favour of sensationalism. Sadly, expert commentators were largely ignored by the media.<sup>[[2]](https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2021/11/15/the-law-the-baghuz-airstrike-and-accusations-of-a-possible-war-crime-and-cover-up/)</sup></sup> When the NYT reached out to CENTCOM prior to publishing, they received a full statement that undercuts NYT's entire narrative. Captain Bill Urban, US CENTCOM spokesperson, provided the same statement to to various outlets November 14, 2021, since the NYT left it out entirely: 
 
  "In mid to late March of 2019, U.S., coalition and Syrian Democratic Forces had isolated the final remnants of the ISIS proclaimed territorial caliphate in Baghouz, Syria. The ISIS pocket included thousands of fighters and family members including women and children. The remaining fighters including some women and child combatants along with many ISIS family members, including some who were likely held against their will, decided to make a determined stand in an area that included buildings, tunnels and cliffs. Multiple entreaties to ISIS to allow family members to depart the area were rebuffed, and thousands of family members remained in the area of the fighting. On March 18, 2019, five days before the end of the battle, as many as 200 ISIS fighters launched a determined counterattack on SDF and coalition forces that started around 4 a.m. local time, lasted numerous hours and resulted in more than 30 SDF casualties. After more than 6 hours of fighting and dozens of strikes, numerous U.S. manned and unmanned strike platforms had departed the area due to having expended all of their ordinance. ISIS fighters had inflicted high casualties on the SDF through small arms, rocket propelled grenades, indirect fire, improvised explosive devices and suicide bombings.

   After 10 a.m. local time, an SDF position under heavy fire and in danger of being overrun called for defensive airstrikes on ISIS fighter positions. The SDF fighters reported the area clear of civilians, and the nearest U.S. special operations forces on the ground also reported that they could observe no civilians in the area. The only remaining U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the area at the time of the strike was only capable of providing standard definition full motion video (FMV) as high definition-capable UAVs that were on station earlier had departed following the expenditure of their ordinance. The remaining U.S. UAV had also expended all of its hellfire missiles and was unarmed at the time of the call. The U.S. UAV on station was unable to discern any civilians in the area at the time of the SDF request. The only remaining armed strike aircraft on scene at the time of the request for air support was a U.S. F-15 with precision guided 500-pound bombs. With the area reported clear of civilians, and SDF positions under fire, the special operations strike cell authorized two defensive strikes on ISIS positions with two 500-pound precision guided munitions from the F-15. The strikes were determined to have taken out at least 16 active ISIS fighters that were engaged in attacks on SDF positions.

   Several hours after these two strikes, a coalition UAV operator, who was operating a coalition UAV in the area with high-definition full motion video reported to U.S. special operations forces that the UAV had observed possible civilians in the area at the time of the strike. As the U.S. strike cell was unaware of the presence of the coalition UAV, U.S. special operations forces did not have access to their feed at the time of the strike. In response to this report, U.S. special operations forces leaders initiated a civilian casualty credibility assessment which determined that the report of civilian casualties was credible and warranted a 15-6 investigation. The civilian casualty credibility assessment and the 15-6 determined through the study of all available evidence including coalition high-definition video, that several locations unobserved by the U.S. UAV with men, women, and children likely received lethal effects from the strikes. The investigations concluded that at least 4 civilians were killed and 8 were wounded from these strikes. The investigations were unable to conclusively characterise the status of more than 60 other casualties that resulted from these strikes. The reason for this uncertainty is that multiple armed women and at least one armed child were observed in the video, and the exact mixture of armed and unarmed personnel could not be conclusively determined.

   Likely, a majority of those killed were also combatants at the time of the strike, however, it is also highly likely that there were additional civilians killed by these two strikes. The 15-6 investigation concluded that these two strikes were legitimate self-defense strikes in support of SDF forces under fire, that they were proportional due to the unavailability of smaller ordinance at the time of the request, and that appropriate steps were taken to rule out the presence of civilians at the time of the strike. To prevent unintended casualties in the future, the investigation recommended requiring high-definition video for similar strikes in the future, and the requirement for the strike cell to coordinate with any coalition surveillance assets in the area at the time of the strike, and those recommendations were implemented. Finally, in accordance with the findings, the investigating officer determined that no disciplinary actions were warranted. We abhor the loss of innocent life and take all possible measures to prevent them. In this case, we self-reported and investigated the strike according to our own evidence and take full responsibility for the unintended loss of life. It is important to understand that ISIS decided to put their own families at risk when all avenues of escape were afforded to them. It is also important to note that some women and children, whether through indoctrination or choice, decided to take up arms in this battle and as such could not strictly be classified as civilians. Ultimately, the determined effort of U.S., coalition and SDF forces culminated the final territorial defeat of ISIS on March 23, 2019, but it did not come without a significant cost of U.S. and partner casualties or without the regrettable loss of civilian life."<sup>[[3]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/2844585/us-central-command-statement-to-correct-the-record-from-capt-bill-urban/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/baghouz-strike)</sup></sup>
  
  After the media reporting, SecDef Austin appointed a Four-Star General to review the matter. The review consisted of 20 experts, which reviewed 124 documents, 25 reports, and 29 hours of video feed. It found that the "Ground Force Commander repeatedly received confirmation that no civilians were in the strike area" and that, "multiple efforts to distinguish civilians from ISIS were made, and the engagements were proportional... GFC acted reasonably and within the bounds of the ROE and LOW. I found clear evidence that the GFC demonstrated awareness and concern for CIVCAS and took steps to mitigate harm. My review also included information that was not available to the GFC at the time. That additional information shows that, through no fault of his own, the GFC relied on data that was not fully accurate. In accordance with the LOW, the GFC's actions cannot be judged based on what we know now in hindsight, but only on the reasonableness of his decisions given the information known at the time." It also concluded, "A secondary basis for the allegations of concealment and wrongdoing was a series of three articles published by the New York Times. A thorough analysis of all available information indicates there is no evidence to support these allegations as they relate to the strikes on 18 March 2019 examined by this review."

  It should be noted, this review confirms CENTCOM's statement that a CIVCAS allegation was made immediately following the strike. The appearance that that it wasn't taken seriously by the person who raised a complaint was due to the credibility assessment and the 15-6 investigation both missing their deadlines for completion. "the original review of the incident to determine whether the allegations of CIVCAS were credible and the AR 15-6 investigation report were both submitted after their respective deadlines. In addition, although the incident was reviewed and investigated, administrative steps to close the incident and thereby cause it to be included in reports to Congress did not occur."<sup>[[5]](https://media.defense.gov/2022/May/17/2002999192/-1/-1/1/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-INDEPENDENT-REVIEW-OF-18-MARCH-2019-CIVILIAN-CASUALTY-INCIDENT-IN-BAGHUZ-SYRIA.PDF)</sup></sup>

- On October 22 2021, A U.S. airstrike conducted by an MQ-9 drone, in northwest Syria killed senior al-Qaeda leader Abdul Hamid al-Matar. 0 civilian casualties are assessed.<sup>[[1]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2820408/us-strike-in-the-vicinity-of-suluk-syria-oct-22-2021/)</sup></sup>
   
- On August 29, 2021, US forces conducted an airstrike in self-defense; believed to be an imminent ISIS-K threat to Hamad Karzai International airport. Immediately after the strike, CENTCOM issued a statement that acknowledged possible CIVCAS, before any local or international media reported on it, "We are assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time."<sup>[[1]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2756206/us-central-command-statement-on-defensive-strike-in-kabul/)</sup></sup> A follow-up statement that same day said, "We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today... We are still assessing the results of this strike..."<sup>[[2]](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2756293/update-us-central-command-statement-on-defensive-strike-in-kabul/)</sup></sup> 
  
  On September 17, an independent investigation was completed. It found, "The initial compound from which the Toyota Corolla came from is a confirmed ISIS-K facility. Rocket attacks came from there, among other intel (post strike), upholding this assessment; 60 sources of intel were coming in, indicating a white Toyota Corolla would be used for an attack; 6 drones in total, over 8 hours, observed the movements; The secondary explosives reported in post-review seem to indicate propane tanks detonated to the rear of the vehicle; Weaponeering was completed to mitigate CIVCAS, such as delayed fuse, making sure no assessed civilians were near, etc. All ROEs were followed on the time-sensitive target. An initial CIVCAS review was initiated within 24 hours of the incident. This was not prompted by the NYT article.<sup>[[3]](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2780738/general-kenneth-f-mckenzie-jr-commander-of-us-central-command-and-pentagon-pres/)</sup></sup>

- On June 27, 2021, President Biden, authorised US Military defensive precision airstrikes against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region. The targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. Specifically, the U.S. strikes targeted operational and weapons storage facilities. These strikes were legal under US domestic and international law. 0 civilians were killed.<sup>[[1]](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2672875/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)</sup></sup>

- On June 3, 2021, the US Department of Defense released its annual civilian casualty report pursuant to Section 1057 of the 2018 NDAA, as amended. The report covers Calendar Year 2020 for Global Military operations. It assesses that in 2020, US Military operations resulted in 23 civilians killed and 10 injured. The report also updated the Department's previous casualty numbers from prior years. The DoD assessment is based off of all NGO, media, and foreign Government submissions, self-reporting, etc. Its methodology is superior to that of NGOs, as it relies on classified and sensitive methods to determine casualties, including footage before, during, and after each incident. The Department is also transparent in updating prior reporting to increase the numbers, should new credible information be discovered. The new report details the near completion of two independent studies required by Congress.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/02/2002732834/-1/-1/0/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2020.PDF)</sup></sup>

- In 2013, Obama issued formal rules and SOPs for High Value Target capture/lethal action missions, outside areas of active hostilities. This was called the Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG). This was followed under the Trump administration with the Principles, Standards and Procedures (PSP) guidance. Contrary to sensational reporting, it did not lower any standards to protect civilians. Like the Obama guidance, it keeps intact layered oversight and bureaucracy. Contrary to such inaccurate media reporting, as the declassified PSP reads, "The law of armed conflict imposes important constraints on the ways in which the United States uses force abroad. Direct action will be discriminating and precise in order to avoid noncombatant casualties. The United States goes to extraordinary lengths to reduce the likelihood of noncombatant casualties in CT operations, exercising restraint as a matter of policy that often exceeds what is required by LOAC. Direct Action should be undertaken wherever practicable and consistent with US interests and applicable domestic and international law. The United States will continue to take extraordinary measures to ensure with near certainty that noncombatants will not be injured or killed in the course of operations, using all reasonably available information and means of verification." This guidance, to, was revised under President Biden, called the Presidential Policy Memorandum (PPM). It maintains the same standards as both the PPG and PSP.<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23867592-presidential-policy-memorandum?responsive=1&title=1)</sup></sup>

- On October 9, 2019, United Nations Mission Afghanistan released a report claiming US forces illegally struck drug facilities, resulting in civilian casualties. This report was discredited for citing Jihadi propaganda websites, its deeply flawed legal examination, etc. From the response: "United States Forces — Afghanistan (USFOR—A) disputes the findings, legal analysis, and methodology of the UNAMA report released. USFOR—A is concerned by the way UNAMA reached its conclusions and disagrees with their mischaracterization of the Taliban in the methamphetamine production facilities; their reliance on sources with conflicted motives or limited knowledge (including the Taliban propaganda website "Voice of Jihad"); and their narrow definition of legally targetable combatants. By the time USFOR—A decided to conduct precision strikes, intelligence and operations professionals knew what the Taliban narcotics production facilities looked like, exactly where they were and who was allowed entry. USFOR—A and partner organizations also knew the pattern–of–life for their operations and locales. Under US legal definitions and rules and policies governing the conduct of war, and after exhaustive and comprehensive review of the facilities and those running them, USFOR—A and partner entities determined personnel in the labs were members of the Taliban and lawful military targets. USFOR—A deliberately chose the targets and the timing for the strikes to avoid non-combatant casualties, striking during the daylight hours to maximize the ability to obtain and share site pictures which ensured we could verify the absence of civilians. On the day of operations, USFOR—A observation of the targeted sites used multiple surveillance platforms, including aircraft with full-motion video gathering capabilities. USFOR—A pre-strike processes included scores of hours of scrutiny of targeted sites to ensure we could verify non-combatants were not present. USFOR—A had degrees of certainty required at the time of the precision strikes to assess forces were only striking legal targets and avoiding non-combatant casualties and collateral damage. USFOR—A even declined to strike nearly a dozen production facilities due to even a slight possibility for civilian casualties. The investigations leading to the identification and characterization of these methamphetamine production facilities, their ownership and oversight by the Taliban, the internal rules allowing entry only to Taliban combatants, as well as the flow of funds from these locations to Taliban operations, were combined operations with Afghan security partners. These operations against these Taliban revenue sources were planned and developed over the course of a year, drawing upon the expertise and resources of a wide array of interagency and inter-governmental organizations and relying upon extensive intelligence collection."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/USFORA-airstrike-response)</sup></sup>

As described by the investigators, Inspector A played a minor supporting role in the investigation of the Douma incident, and he did not have access to all of the information gathered by the FFM team, including witness interviews, laboratory results, and analyses by independent experts. Although Inspector A’s assessment purports to be an official OPCW FFM report on the Douma incident, it is instead a personal document created with incomplete information and without authorisation. With respect to Inspector B, after he was selected to be a member of the FFM for the first time, he travelled to Syria in April 2018. He never left the command post in Damascus because he had not completed the necessary training required to deploy on-site to Douma. Inspector B separated from the OPCW at the end of August 2018; however, he continued to approach staff members in an effort to have continued access to and influence over the Douma investigation. The majority of the FFM’s work occurred after Inspector B’s separation, and during the last seven months of the FFM’s investigation (August 2018 through February 2019). After the issuance of the interim report on Douma in July 2018, it took an additional seven months for the FFM to further investigate the incident and conduct the bulk of its work. During this period, Inspector A no longer had any supporting role regarding the FFM; Inspector B was no longer employed by the OPCW as of late August 2018. 
 
  Inspectors A and B are not whistle-blowers. They are individuals who could not accept that their views were not backed by evidence. When their views could not gain traction... Their behaviour is even more egregious as they had manifestly incomplete information about the Douma investigation. Therefore, as could be expected, their conclusions are erroneous, uninformed, and wrong."<sup>[[13]](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2021/04/opcw-releases-second-report-investigation-and-identification-team)</sup></sup> 

- On the 1st of April, 2018, US forces received fire from Al-Shabaab fighters in the vicinity of El Burr, Somalia. They called in an airstrike. This was the kinetic end to the months-long target development of a HVT target. An independent review found the strike followed established operating procedures to mitigate civilian casualties. Initially, it was assessed no civilians were killed. However, further review of full motion video determined that a female and child had entered the target vehicle.

U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon told the Washington Post that the U.S. military only uses white phosphorus in “accordance with the law of armed conflict” – for example “for screening, obscuring and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures.” Other Coalition forces have used WP in this manner before, in other countries: Talking to NPR, New Zealand Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan said, "We have utilized white phosphorus to screen areas within west Mosul to get civilians out safely."

- A comprehensive, independent study from NDU, assessed US air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, between January 2015 to December 2017. The study pulled experts from Think Tanks and within the DoD, as well as establishing an NGO advisory panel. It consisted four components: 1) A literature, legal, and policy review; 2) analyses of quantitative data: strikes, civilian casualties, and US military assessments of civilian casualties; 3) semi-structured interviews with operators analysts, headquarters staff, and senior commanders, and 4) Roundtable discussions with NGOs.<sup>[[1]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048479-2018-Civilian-Casualty-Military-Study.html)</sup></sup>
  It reached four main findings:
  - Finding A.1. The delegation of Target Engagement Authority did not directly cause an increase in the rate of CIVCAS during OIR.
  - Finding A.2. There is clear written guidance and oversight regarding civilian casualty mitigation for deliberate and dynamic strikes. There is also widespread priority to minimize civilian casualties from the highest to lowest levels.
  - Finding A.3. Commanders throughout the chain of command exercised thorough oversight. These findings are consistent for declared theaters with Operating Principles that authorize direct action and Areas of Active Hostility, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Somalia, as well as Outside Areas of Active Hostility.
  - Finding A.4 The Positive Identification process has sufficient guidance and structure and therefore does not increase the risk for civilian casualties. 
    
    The review also found that US strikes rarely peaked above 5 CIVCAS over the 3 year period.
    
- On March 16 2017, in al-Jinah, Syria, US forces stuck a building where AQ and Syrian militant groups were meeting. An investigation, which combined NGO reporting and all other evidence found that the struck resulted in minimal damage to a little Mosque next door. This airstrike resulted in a single civilian injured. The Target Engagement Authority was unaware the smaller building was being built as a Mosque. This was due to intel analysts shift changes, etc. Thus, the approve chain would have been different for the strike. UNHRC issued a fatally flawed report on Syria, that found this airstrike likely in violation of IHL. However, world-leading scholars have refuted the report, which misapplies International law, and thus reaches an erroneous conclusion.<sup>[[1]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/unhrc-commission-inquiry-syria-misapplies-law-armed-conflict)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/al-Jinah)</sup></sup>

- A study by two world-leading experts concerning Iraq and Afghanistan US operations concludes, "We analyzed two sets of data dealing with these wars: the first, from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), details all founded investigations alleging serious law of armed conflict violations in Iraq and Afghanistan by Sailors, SEALs, and Marines; the second, from the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA), details all cases of alleged serious law of armed conflict violations by soldiers referred to court-martial. The NCIS data indicates that ninety-two allegations of serious law of armed conflict violations were substantiated, thirty-seven of which led to courts-martial (a number of others received non-judicial punishment), and twenty-eight of which resulted in conviction. The ACCA data shows 100 referred cases, of which seventy-eight resulted in conviction on at least one offense. Many of these cases resulted in substantial sentences, including life imprisonment."<sup>[[1]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-us-military-receive-benefit-doubt-when-investigating-itself-alleged-war-crimes)</sup></sup>

- Contrary to sensational media allegations, US forces did not strike the Syrian dam on March 26, 2017. US forces struck the towers near the dam, used by ISIS. These towers are not connected to the dam. Further munitions used were non-cratering munitions. No civilians killed/injured, and no damage to the dam occurred, according to documents obtained by NYT.<sup>[[1]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nc-3-27-17-syria/bff38494ffb87814/full.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.centcom.mil/Portals/6/Documents/Transcripts/28MAR%20CJTFOIR%20GEN%20Townsend.pdf?ver=2017-03-31-075531-900)</sup></sup>

- A 2017 report, requested by Congress, examined between FY 2011–16, finds that the US investigated all allegations of human rights abuses committed by Afghan forces, including child abuse reports made externally and internally, as best they could and cut off aid to those units implicated. Convictions were landed on those who committed the crimes. The report does find some issues, and the agencies involved have their comments at the end. There wasn't a consolidated process, and as US forces drew down—they lacked the insights they once had into abuse allegations. "SIGAR found no evidence that U.S. forces were told to ignore human rights abuses or child sexual assault. Following the establishment of the State and Defense Leahy Vetting Procedures for the Afghan National Security Forces in July 2014, and a biweekly joint DOD and State Afghanistan Gross Violation of Human Rights Forum (Leahy Forum), the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD-P) began to track gross violation of human rights incidents—including child sexual assault—that were reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum. According to data provided by OUSD-P, as of August 12, 2016, the office was tracking 75 reported gross violation of human rights incidents. Of these reported incidents, 7 involved child sexual assault, 46 involved other gross violations of human rights, and 22 were classified at a level above Secret because of the sensitivity of the information or the sources and methods used to obtain the information. These incidents ranged in date from 2010 through 2016, and included gross violations of human rights allegedly committed by Afghan security forces within the MOD and MOI. The incidents reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum came from a variety of sources including intelligence reports, news articles, U.S. forces, and the Afghan government. Of the 75 reported incidents in the OUSD-P tracker, 7 involved allegations of child sexual assault—1 that the Leahy Forum found to be credible, 5 that remain under review, and 1 that was found not credible. Five of the seven involved MOI units, and two involved MOD units. The one credible incident was reported by the Afghan government. In this instance, the government reported that two ANA Special Operations Command (ANASOC) noncommissioned officers (NCOs) attempted to sexually assault a girl to coerce information from her mother. Following a trial, both NCOs were indicted and convicted for attempted sexual assault of a minor in violation of the penal code and sentenced to 6 years of confinement. Based on the information the Afghan government provided, DOD determined that it had credible information of a gross violation of human rights and began the process to remediate the unit. Also details improvements made on the Afghan side including legislative, as well as other high-level efforts by the US Government working with the Afghans. It found no evidence, as NGOs/media alleged, that US forces were told to ignore child sex abuse/other human rights abuses.<sup>[[1]](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/inspections/SIGAR%2017-47-IP.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
- On 28 January 2017, President Trump authorised a Special Operations raid in al-Bayda, Yemen. The raid was successful, though tragic, in its collection highly important information. Media and NGOs claimed that during the raid, a firefight killed as many as 30 or more civilians. This however, was a hoax. According to declassified documents obtained by the ACLU, show that high resolution footage (covering many Points of View), and sensitive intelligence, confirm between 4-12 civilian casualties, supposedly to include Nawar "Nora" al-Awlaki.<sup>[[1]](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf)</sup></sup> Women also participated in the fight.<sup>[[2]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400/Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.pdf)</sup></sup> Classified documents also obtained by the ACLU show the mission was authorised because it satisfied the NCV 0 policy.

- During the a battle in Boz Village, Kunduz, Afghanistan on Nov 3, 2016, Afghan Special Forces attempted to capture Taliban leaders responsible for the surge in violence that year. A small element of US troops were present to provide advice and assistance. Taliban forces opened fire from multiple buildings. US and Afghan forces were forced to request aerial fire support from U.S. platforms in self defense. Aerial fires were also used to suppress Taliban who were firing on U.S. medical evacuation assets as the dead and wounded were evacuated. Sadly, as a result of Taliban actions, 33 civilians were killed. An independent investigation concluded that U.S. air assets used the minimum amount of force required to neutralize the various threats from the civilian buildings and protect friendly forces. The investigation further concluded that no civilians were seen or identified in the course of the battle.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170520120301/http://www.rs.nato.int/article/press-releases/civilian-casualties-confirmed-in-boz-village-kunduz.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/nov-2016-boz-airstrike)</sup></sup>

Support has included: mid-air refuelling (outside Yemen airspace), and limited intelligence sharing to help further mitigate impact to civilians.<sup>[[1]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390794-Acting-GC-Letter-to-Majority-Leader-Re-Sanders.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/isp-i-20-19_rdweb_508.pdf#page=10)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/isp-i-20-19_rdweb_508.pdf#page=20)</sup></sup> US & British Governments have worked well to train, advice and develop Saudi Arabia's international law compliance, according to a UK High Court ruling).<sup>[[4]](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf)</sup></sup> The Kingdom, US, UK, and many other countries pour in humanitarian aid as they work with the Yemen Government to fight off Iran-backed terrorist orgs.<sup>[[5]](https://www.ksrelief.org/Pages/Partners/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-6-2020-united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-aid-people-yemen)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/countries/YE)</sup></sup> Further, an internal, independent report required by law, found that: no credible information indicating abuse of detainees in Yemen by U.S. personnel or U.S. allies and partners; DOD had not identified any violations of the DOD Leahy Law in Yemen and that DOD personnel had not observed any indications of detainee abuse by coalition partners or developed any credible information that U.S. allies or partners had committed any abuses against detainees in Yemen that would make them ineligible for assistance.<sup>[[8]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105988.pdf#page=40)</sup></sup> 

- In 2016, Obama released, per EO 13732 Sec. 3, data concerning High Value Target CT missions Outside Areas of Active Hostilities. The first report covers from Jan 2009 to Dec 2015. It shows that there was a total of 473 strikes with a total of between 2372-2581 combatants killed and only between 64-117 civilians killed.<sup>[[1]](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF)</sup></sup> Following this, the 2016 report was issued, giving us: 53 total strikes. With 431-441 combatants killed and only 1 civilian killed. Both records make clear to refute the allegations that any "military-aged male" in area of target is deemed a combatant, or "retroactively" designated combatants. To quote, "Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants."<sup>[[2]](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Summary-of-2016-Information-Regarding-United-States-Counterterrorism-Strikes-Outside-Areas-of-Active-Hostilities.pdf)</sup></sup> For an overview of the domestic, international law and policy frameworks that guide US Military operations, especially as they relate to Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia: See this 2016 compendium.<sup>[[3]](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Legal_Policy_Report.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 2001 up to the present day, the drone campaign has resulted in disrupting many terrorist networks, and resulted in very few civilian casualties. Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the confirmation hearing for John Brennan, confirmed as a result of Congressional oversight, that the civilian deaths per year as a result of drone strikes is often in the single digits.<sup>[[1]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/11331.pdf)</sup></sup> Lethal strikes are only sought if capture of HVTs is not feasible.<sup>[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download)</sup></sup> Leaked documents from the Intercept confirm that these missions (including ground raids) result in very few civilian casualties. From September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2012 in Afghanistan, out of a total of 2,082 missions only 14 civilians were killed or injured. That's 0.67%. Media have incorrectly claimed that these documents show a 90% civilian casualty rate from drone strikes. They neither are specific about drones nor, as shown, have a 90% CIVCAS stat—only a 0.67%.<sup>[[3]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2460857/operation-haymaker-afghanistan-documents.pdf#page=16)</sup></sup> Another document leaked confirms the time and care taken into approving each strike. Missions can only be approved by POTUS if the host nation consents.

From these, a picture starts to emerge:
  - The “average approval time” for a proposed strike under the AUMF process was 79 days. Even excluding the single longest approval, presumably an unrepresentative outlier, the average was 58 days. The fastest approval was 27 days.
  - These approvals were preceded by lengthy periods of gathering and analyzing intelligence on the targets—an average of six years.
  - Four out of 24 proposed concepts of operations covered by the study were disapproved under the AUMF review process.
  - The process for approving strikes under the AUMF “requires significant intel/ISR to justify (and maintain) approvals.” “Relatively few, high-level terrorists meet criteria for targeting” under this process. (Note that this isn’t a press release touting the program’s robust oversight; it’s an internal DOD assessment, written from the perspective of operators for whom a laborious approval process is an obstacle rather than a virtue.)
  - These “[p]olitical constraints” make these operations “challenging” and “fundamentally different from what we’ve experienced in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

  Further, the "drones cause blowback" talking-point has long been discredited in academic literature.<sup>[[6]](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/42/4/47/12192/Do-U-S-Drone-Strikes-Cause-Blowback-Evidence-from?redirectedFrom=fulltextl)</sup></sup>

- On 3 October, 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130 accidentally misidentified the Kunduz Trauma Centre, operated by Doctors without Borders. Per an independent investigation, "During the Period of Darkness (POD) 27 / 28 Sep 15, Taliban forces initiated a large-scale attack on Kunduz City (Kunduz), a city of 300,000 and the capital of Kunduz Province. The Taliban moved into Kunduz in force and by the evening of 28 Sep, had taken over key locations within the city. A ll levels of US and Afghan commands were surprised at the speed and scope of the attack. After the initial fighting , a majority of the Afghan National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) stationed in Kunduz fled to the Kunduz Airfield south of the city, where one US Special Forces (USSF) Operation Detachment-Alpha (ODA) team was headquartered. On 28 Sep, US and Afghan Special Operations Forces (SOF) were planning a major operation in another part of the country. The Taliban takeover of Kunduz caused SOF to quickly shift planning efforts and resources to support ANDSF operations to re-take the city. The US Special Operations Task Force ordered two additional ODA teams, under the direction of a [redacted] o travel to Kunduz to reinforce the ODA team at the Kunduz Airfield. The next day, a combined element of USSF and ANDSF prevented the Taliban from overrunning the airfield.  During the POD 30 Sep / 1 Oct, USSF, along with multiple Afghan Special Security Forces (ASSF) units, fought their way from the airfield into the city. The forces ultimately established a strong point defense in the Kunduz Provincial Chief of Police (PCOP) compound. From 30 Sep until the early evening hours of 2 Oct, the USSF and ASSF at the PCOP compound repelled multiple enemy attacks against their strongpoint. USSF expected to stay at the strongpoint for 24 hours, but due to operational exigencies, remained through 3 Oct. As conditions deteriorated in Kunduz, the MSF leadership contacted multiple US and ANDSF commands, providing the locations of MSF facilities in Kunduz, to include the Trauma Center. Multiple individuals at all levels of command were notified of the MSF Trauma Center's location via MSF or through the US chain-of-command. The MSF Trauma Center was also identified as a hospital in Department of Defense databases since Oct 14. On the night of 2 Oct, ASSF leadership notified the USSF ground forces of a pending ASSF operation into the city and provided the location of the ASSF's objective, an Afghan Government compound. The ASSF objective compound was 500 meters away from the USSF ground force position at the PCOP compound, and could not be seen from that location.

  That same night, an AC-130U Gunship flew from Bagram Airfield to support the USSF operations in Kunduz. The aircrew was alerted and launched 69 minutes early, due to a request made by USSF leadership. Due to the early launch, the aircrew did not have the typical information it would have on a mission. While enroute to Kunduz, one of the aircraft's critical communications systems failed, resulting in the aircraft's inability to receive and transmit certain critical information to multiple command headquarters. While loitering over Kunduz, the aircraft avoided a significant surface to air threat. In response, the Aircraft Commander took defensive measures that decreased the aircrew's ability to precisely locate targets on the ground. The aircrew navigator notified the JTAC that the grid plotted to a field, and the aircrew identified a large complex 300 meters southwest from the JTAC provided grid location provided. The navigator requested ground force confirmation that this was the ASSF objective. The JT AC conferred with the GFC, who conferred with the Afghans, who confirmed that the compound was the correct objective. The JTAC replied 15 seconds later that the large compound was the ASSF objective. The aircrew did not realize they were observing the MSF Trauma Center. The ground force and aircrew were unaware the aircrew was firing on a hospital throughout the course of the engagement."<sup>[[1]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2819730/RESPONSIVE-DOCUMENTS.pdf)</sup></sup>

-  In 2014, Congress created a new authority for the Department of Defense (DoD) to train and equip select Syrians in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, Section 1209 of P.L. 113-291, as amended). This authority, as amended by subsequent legislation, enables DoD “to provide assistance, including: training equipment, supplies, stipends, construction of training and associated facilities, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals.” Such assistance activities are authorized for select purposes, including supporting U.S. efforts to combat the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria and promoting the conditions for a negotiated settlement to Syria’s civil war.

- On February 2012, in Afghanistan, 100 Qurans and other religious material were burned in an incinerator. Pundits claimed this was evidence of US not caring for the culture and religious material in Afghanistan as elsewhere. However, an independent investigation found this wasn't the reason: On the night of 20 February 2012. up to 100 Qur'ans and other religious materials were burned in an incinerator at BAF. The events leading up to the incident involved a search of the library books in the library at the Detention Facility at In Parwan (DFIP). Because of suspicions that detainees were using library books to pass notes and messages, members of the 535th  Military Police (MP) Battalion (BN) and the Theatre Intelligence Group (TIG) Counter-Intelligence (CI) Team at  the DFIP planned a search of the books in the library. During the search, one of the interpreters helping to interpret the notes and messages written in the books reported that approximately 60-75 percent of the books in the library also contained extremist content. A junior leader perceived that he had permission from his commander to remove the objectionable materials from the library, and the library search team began to separate texts for removal. A work detail loaded the books into a supply truck as part of the nightly burn pit run. During the loading process an Afghan National Army (ANA) Soldier and an ANA interpreter expressed concern about removing the books to US Service Members loading the books. Because the US  Service Members thought that the books were contraband, they disregarded the ANA and interpreter's cautions. The ANA Soldier and interpreter then  voiced their concerns to DFIP Operations, but by the time that Battle Captains in DFIP Operations figured out what was happening. the truck was already on its way to the burn pit. Many books were burned before a local national at the burn pit noticed that some of the books were Qur'ans. 

  Overall Findings. In the course of events on 20 February. I find that US  Service Members mishandled Qur'ans and other religious material, to include their disposal at an incinerator. I do not find  that those involved acted with any malicious intent to disrespect the Quran or defame the faith of Islam, however. Ultimately, this tragic incident resulted from a lack of cross-talk between leaders and commands, a lack of senior leader involvement in giving clear guidance in a complex operation, junior and mid-grade leaders choosing the easy way instead of the right way to address a problem. distrust among our US Service Members and our partners. ignorance by US Service Members with respect to the importance and handling of the Quran as well as other religious material. and poor adherence by US  Service Members to established procedures. Clearly a decisive point in the events that took place that day was the segregation of religious books based on the advice of primarily one linguist who characterized the books as "radical" or 'extremist' in nature. over-reliance on one linguist's interpretation of book content improperly influenced a series of tactical decisions, resulting in a strategic crisis. Nonetheless, US Service Members made the decision to segregate, remove, and bum the books and own the responsibility for their destruction. That US  Service Members did not heed the  warnings of their ANA partners is, perhaps. my biggest concern. Despite all the missteps, at no time was the path chosen by the involved US Service Members motivated by hatred or intolerance of a particular faith."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/quran-investigation)</sup></sup>

- Between 2013 and 2016, occasionally articles would appear alleging that US Special Forces (ODA 3124), while deployed to Wardak Province, Afghanistan in 2011, kidnapped, tortured and executed 15 civilians.

- A 2010 international group of experts, by the IAEA, reviewed four sites in Southern Iraq in which Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions were used in the 2003 conflict. The report finds that "the radiation doses from DU do not pose a radiological hazard to the population at the four studied locations in southern Iraq. The estimated annual committed effective radiation doses that could arise from exposure to DU residues are low, always less than 100 μSv/a and only to a few, if any, individuals, and therefore of little radiological concern. The estimated radiation doses are less than those received on average by individuals from natural sources of radiation in the environment (worldwide average 2.4 mSv/a), below internationally recommended dose limits for members of the public (1 mSv/a) and below the action level of 10 mSv/a set out in the IAEA Safety Standard on Remediation of Areas Contaminated by Past Activities and Accidents [1] to establish whether remedial actions are necessary... it is likely that the general picture is not very different at other locations in Iraq where DU was used in the 2003 conflict. The conclusions reached in international studies of other situations where DU munitions were employed (Kuwait and the Balkans) were similar to those of this report and support the belief that the radiological impact of the residues from the firing of DU munitions is also likely to be low in other parts of Iraq."<sup>[[1]](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1434_web.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2010, Chelsea Manning leaked what became known as the 'Iraq and Afghan war logs.' It's worth noting that the vast majority of these leaks are in plain-text format. So, while the damaged caused was great—to SIGINT, GEOINT and HUMINT—which put civilians at risk from attack,<sup>[[1]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3868778/Wikileaks-Manning-Defense-Department-Damage.pdf)</sup></sup> the actual things that matter to the media was the CIVCAS numbers. Sadly, no one is able to independently verify and confirm the plain-text files released by wikileaks are accurate. Even worse, some stories don't even cite to the plain-text files on wikileaks site. The only thing that was leaked, that seemed to indicate wrong-doing by the US Military, concerned a video, that was dubbed "collateral murder." However, upon critical examination of the facts and law, no war crime occurred: On July 12, 2007, a US Apache helicopter was providing force protection to Bravo Company 2-16. The Company had been in near continuous contact from insurgents since dawn. The Apache spotted a group of armed men heading in the direction of Bravo Company. The Apache kept its eye on the group until one person peaked around a corner, knelt, and shouldered what appeared to be an RPG. Indeed, the leaked footage from wikileaks confirms this. After the Apache cleared the building, it was cleared to engage the insurgents. The second engagement was also lawful, as the van was assessed to be more combatants aiding the injured insurgents. No children were seen in the van. After the dust settled: Unknown to the Apache crew, all but two people turned out to be insurgents—they were two journalists with Reuters. It must be highlighted that these two journalists were not wearing the standard 'press' or 'media' vests, nor did they tell the military they'd be present in an area that had seen fighting for days on end. Among the bodies, there were RPGs, AKMs, and other weapons. There was no violation of the Laws of War or Rules of Engagement.<sup>[[2]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1506533/30-2nd-brigade-combat-team-15-6-investigation-pdf.pdf)</sup></sup> Manning was charged and convicted for a [number of crimes, none of which were political or in retaliation.<sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20190304152646/https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/Apps/ACCAOpinions/ACCAOpinions.nsf/ODD/818BA3ADDACC08A28525829E0060B9B1/$FILE/oc-manning,%20be.pdf)</sup></sup>Further, just being shot and injured doesn't automatically make one hors de combat.<sup>[[4]](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/down-not-always-out-hors-de-combat-close-fight/)</sup></sup>

- 12 February 2010 in Gardez District, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, news reports had claimed US Special Forces deliberately killed a pregnant woman, and covering it up. An independent investigation was ordered to answer two principle questions: Did the ground force deliberately mislead its higher headquarters in initial reports regarding this incident and did the ground force attempt to hide the circumstances surrounding the casualties by altering, tampering with, and/or cleaning up the incident scene? The investigation concludes that the answer to both of these questions is "No" and recommends no disciplinary action against the assault force members.

Civilian casualties resulted because of the complex environment: "The use of military force in this engagement with the Taliban was an appropriate means to destroy that enemy threat within the requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  However, the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimize accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties. Throughout the conduct of this operation, the Ground Force Commander' s (GFC) ability to break contact was hampered by the effects of direct fire contact with a significant enemy force, a  lengthy effort to medically evacuate (MEDEVAC) U.S. and Afghan critically injured personnel by helicopter, and persistent, real-time intelligence on the enemy's continuing efforts to manoeuvre, mass, re-arm, and re-attack friendly forces from within the village. The independent investigation concluded that the Laws of Armed Conflict were followed. At least 26 civilians were killed. Around 78 Taliban were killed. This is also known as the Granai (also spelled Gerani) airstrike.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20110511160906/http://www.centcom.mil/images/pdf/uscentcom%20farah%20unclass%20exsum%2018%20jun%2009.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On 22 August, 2008, US Close Air Support killed 33 civilians in Azizabad, Afghanistan. US MARSOC and Afghan Special Forces executed a kill/capture of a High Value Target. After successful infiltration, the Afghan/US team received hostile force engagement. They requested CAS. Unknown to both US & Afghan forces, the hostile engagement positions were in close proximity to civilians. Allegations that the US/Afghan forces committed violations of the Rules of Engagement or Law of War during the 21-22 August 2008 firefight resulting in 90 civilian deaths are unsubstantiated]. The first investigation concluded there was 6 civilians killed. Subsequent to new information provided by UNAMA, ICRC, etc, the US conducted another, more comprehensive investigation. It found that there were 33 CIVCAS and 22 anti-coalition  militants died. The independent investigation 28 interviews resulting in more than 20 hours of recorded testimony from Afghan government officials, Afghan village elders, officials from IGOs/NGOs, US and Afghan service members, 236 documents and 11 videos. It also found villager statements heavily inconsistent, and other severe methodological flaws by the NGOs and UNAMA. The second investigation also incorporated FBI forensic teams to aid its efforts.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/Azizabad-august-2008-MARSOC/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

- 4 March, 2007, Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, a MSOC-F (a unit of MARSOC, Marine Special Operations Command), "convoy was subject to a complex ambush. Small arms fire, and a Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device approached the convoy at a high rate of speed and detonated. The convoy defended against additional near-simultaneous attacks, quickly regrouped, and resumed movement west on Highway A1 using authorised procedures to disperse the crowds and unblock the road to allowing the convoy to continue its westward route. Within 30 minute of the blast, and the convoy's return to base, internet media reports began surfacing indicating that a coalition convoy had opened fir on civilians, killing and wounding many. An Air Force Colonel was appointed to conduct an investigation into the facts surrounding the incident. The Colonel ignored statements by those in the  convoy, ignored EOD specialists, and placed too much at face value on alleged witness testimony. Another investigation was appointed, a formal Court of Inquiry (COI) to independently determine the facts and circumstances relative to the actions of MSOC-F. After hundreds of interviews, a complete examination of the documentary evidence, the COI found the statements and testimony of the personnel in the MSOC-F convoy to be consistent, truthful, and credible. The COI found that MSOC-F Marines defended appropriately and proportionately against the 4 March 2007 enemy ambush, and that a non-governmental organization employee's unbiased testimony independently corroborated the testimony of the MSOC-F personnel. The COI opined that the findings and conclusions found in Col P's investigation run counter to the weight of the evidence considered by the Court. Additionally, Col P never interviewed the Reconnaissance Operations Center (ROC) Watch Officer on duty, nor did he review the ROC log to determine the sequence of events on 4 March to determine exactly what was reported and to whom it was reported. Based on his conclusion that the use of force applied by the personnel in the convoy was excessive, Col P recommended various personnel in the MSOC-F convoy be charged. Col P's investigation was discredited and the magnitude of his errors cannot be overstated. Col P was in possession of overwhelmingly clear evidence that MSOC-F was ambushed and responded in a discriminate and effective manner. Col P. suppressed exculpating evidence and inexplicably accepted the testimony of Afghans he stopped, apparently randomly, and questioned, making no effort to ascertain the location of the Afghans on 4 Mach 2007 and making no effort to corroborate their statements. Col P did not examine key locations, did not interview any of the Afghans allegedly injured by the Marines, and did not examine the ammunition logs." This is also known as the Shinwar shooting.<sup>[[1]](https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/galvin-pentagon-report-1549974003.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On November 19, 2005, in Haditha, Iraq: a patrol from Company K, 3d Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), mounted in High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles(HMMWVs), was struck by an IED and received some small arms fire near the intersection of Routes Chestnut and Viper in Haditha, Iraq. The patrol suffered one FKIA and two FWIA as a result of the IED attack. During actions taken by the patrol in response to the attack, at least 24 Iraqi civilians were killed near the IED site. Following standard procedures of condolence payments sent to family of victims, reporting came in containing allegations of deliberate and wrongful killings by the Marines. On 14 February 2006, the MNC-1 Commander directed Colonel G.A. Watt to conduct an AR 15-6 investigation into the incident. The investigation concluded that there had been no intentional targeting of noncombatants; that overall, throughout the entire engagement, Marines had attempted to distinguish combatants from noncombatants; that the force used was proportional, and that the Marines provided adequate medical care to non-coalition force casualties. His investigation concluded that the insurgents had violated the LOAC essentially by using homes occupied by noncombatants to attack the Marines. Colonel Watt, however, did conclude that Marines had failed to comply with the ROE in that they had failed to positively identify (PID) targets as legitimate before engaging, resulting in the death of noncombatants. As a result, Colonel Watt recommended further investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) or NCIS. NCIS investigated this matter and found some evidence that two individuals talked to each other about fabricating their accounts of the incident. However, a new, authoritative, final review known as the Bargewell report was established and found, even with the additional evidence provided by NCIS, " as noted, NCIS did uncover evidence that certain squad members coordinated false stories on specific aspects of the incident; however, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the overall deficiencies in reporting and follow-on action—while sometimes perplexing—were not the result of an extensive and orchestrated criminal cover-up throughout the chain of command."<sup>[[1]](https://www.mcmilitarylaw.com/documents/000_mg_bargewell_15-6__haditha_report_.bates.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On August 28, 2005, Reuters journalists in an unmarked vehicle, were filming an ongoing insurgent ambush of the Iraqi Police Services (IPS) and U.S. forces personnel in Bagdad. Around the time of the resurgence, a soldier on the Mall roof observed a lone white vehicle stopped on the roadway at the point where a roadway ramp closest to the Mall merged into an adjacent, parallel road; the roadway where the ambush was ongoing. When observed, the vehicle faced north and was south of the 256th BCT vehicles responding to the ambush. The soldier said he saw the passenger hanging out the window pointing something that appeared to be an RPG; the soldier then yelled an alarm, “RPG.” The soldiers’ team leader heard the alarm and observed the vehicle stopped immediately west of them and facing north toward the 256th BCT vehicles and the ambush area. He also saw the passenger hanging out the passenger window pointing something toward the tanks. He could not positively identify the object and asked another team member to bring binoculars. The team leader testified that by the time he got the binoculars, the passenger had pulled himself and the object he pointed back inside the vehicle; the object was no longer visible. The team leader said he shouted at the people in the vehicle to get them to stop whatever they were doing and he and his team fired warning shots to get their attention. He told us he fired the first shots expecting the vehicle to stay where it was, but it began to back up. They fired more warning shots and when the vehicle did not halt, the team leader ordered disabling shots. Each of the four soldiers on the roof fired disabling shots. Three of the soldiers used M-4 rifles. The fourth solider used an M-249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW). The vehicle slowed and rolled to a stop against a roadway lane barrier south of the soldiers’ position. The team leader reported disabling the vehicle, and one of the tank commanders, using the tank’s optical system, observed the disabled vehicle’s driver apparently dead. The tank commander told the team leader to continue surveillance of the vehicle and keep it in place until the tanks and other 256th BCT vehicles finished searching for the people who initiated the ambush. The soldiers remained on the observation post (OP) until the IO arrived at the scene. About 20 minutes later, the tanks and other 256 the BCT vehicles arrived at the disabled white vehicle. According to the cameraman, who had remained out of sight in the front passenger seat, he sat up and called out “Reuters Cameraman” to the approaching soldiers. This engagement abided by ROE. Reuters Baghdad bureau’s safety practices contributed to the incident. The bureau chief authorized an exception to general safety procedures, allowing local national journalists to enter hostile environments in private passenger vehicles without press markings and without the occupants wearing safety equipment.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090401200028/http://www.dodig.osd.mil/Inspections/IPO/reports/Reuters%20Final%20Print%20Version.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- In November, 2004, in Fallujah, Iraq, TF 2-2 provided indirect fire support to US forces during the battle for Fallujah. During the battle, TF 2-2 lawfully deployed White Phosphorus munitions, described as "shake and bake", to flush out insurgents out of trench lines and spider holes, because of its Psychological impact. To quote from the March 2005 magazine Field Artillery, 'The Fight for Fallujah', "WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE. We fired “shake and bake” missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20200813022427/https://sill-www.army.mil/fires-bulletin-archive/archives/2005/MAR_APR_2005/MAR_APR_2005_FULL_EDITION.pdf)</sup></sup> This entry was misquoted by media to allege that US forces were deploying WP munitions against combatants for its incendiary and/or chemical effects.

- On April 2004, Iraq, CPL Pat Tillman was killed in a friendly fire incident. Pundits claim that he was deliberately killed by his fellow unit members because he had anti-war leanings, and allege there was a coverup. This erroneous conclusion is based on a misreading of several basic facts. 
  
  Background: 
  On April 22, 2004, the 2nd Platoon, A Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment was conducting operations in the vicinity of Magarah, Afghanistan. Because of difficulties caused by an inoperable tactical vehicle, and the mission to achieve an established objective by nightfall, the platoon ground assault convoy, consisting of 41 Army Rangers, 4 Afghan Military Forces (AMF) soldiers, and 12 vehicles, was split into 2 groups or "serials."
  Serial 1 consisted of 19 Rangers traveling in  4 U.S. vehicles and 2 AMF vehicles,
including First Lieutenant (1LT) (the Platoon Leader), CPL Tillman; and 4 AMF soldiers. Serial 2, commanded by Sergeant First Class (SFC) (the Platoon Sergeant), consisted of 22 Rangers and two local Afghans traveling in 4 U.S. vehicles and a privately owned local vehicle .

  After the split, Serial 1 traveled down the canyon road without incident arriving in the vicinity of the village of Manah. Serial 2, however, did not proceed along the separate planned route because SFC believed the risk of accidental injury or death to be too great given the terrain. Therefore, SFC  ordered Serial 2 to travel down the same canyon road that Serial 1 had taken earlier. While traveling down the canyon road, Serial 2 carne under attack from enemy mortar or rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire originating from the top of the canyon walls. Upon hearing them, Serial 1 personnel, led by Staff Sergeant (SSG)(the squad leader), dismounted their vehicles and moved on foot through a small (6-building) village to an elevated spur overlooking the canyon road below and across from the southern ridgeline. CPL Tillman, Private First Class (PFC) and an AMF soldier positioned themselves on the forward slope of the spur visible from and exposed to the canyon road below. lLT and Specialist (SPC) (the Radio Operator), having been delayed by handling communications devices, were positioned at the base of a building in the village some distance below and to the rear of SSG and other Serial 1 personnel.
 
  The first U.S. vehicle in Serial 2 was led by SSG (the squad leader), with a driver and five other occupants. As SSG and his crew moved down the canyon
road, they fired their weapons in suppressive fire along the canyon walls. When SSG's vehicle exited the narrow portion of the canyon road below the spur where CPL Tillman and his team were located, occupants saw muzzle flashes coming from that position. SSG and his team directed their fire toward the muzzle flashes killing both CPL Tillman and the AMF soldier. As SSG's vehicle proceeded past the spur toward the village, vehicle occupants continued to fire on the building in the settlement hitting 1LT in the face and SPC in the knee and chest with small arms fire.

  Aftermath and investigations:
  Several investigates were initiated because, while concluding there was fratricide, contained quality issues. Tillman's Regimental Commander wanted no stone unturned, warranting several investigations to meet this end. The day after the incident, evidence emerged there was fratricide. Tillman's battalion commander (a lieutenant colonel three levels below the Combatant Commander), with the concurrence of his regimental commander, appointed a subordinate Army captain to investigate. That investigation, completed in about 2 weeks, determined CPL Tillman's death was fratricide caused by leadership failures and tactical errors. Dissatisfied with the thoroughness of that investigation, CPL Tillman's regimental commander (a colonel) ordered his own executive officer (a lieutenant colonel) to conduct a second investigation. That investigation, building on the first, was completed in 9 days, confirmed death by friendly fire, and provided expanded findings on the contributing tactical errors. The IG review finds,  "We concluded that the first two investigations, conducted by officers in CPL Tillman's battalion and regiment under Army Regulation (AR) 15-6, "Procedures for Investigating Officers and Boards of Officers," were tainted by the failure to preserve evidence, a lack of thoroughness, the failure to pursue logical investigative leads, and conclusions that were open to challenge based on the evidence provided. More significantly, neither investigator visited the site to visually reenact the incident, secure physical evidence, take photographs, or obtain accurate measurements. As a result, the first two investigations lacked credibility and contributed to perceptions that Army officials were purposefully withholding key information concerning CPL Tillman's death. In November 2004, because oflingering concerns regarding CPL Tillman's death, the Acting Secretary of the Army directed that Lieutenant General (LTG) Phillip R. Kensinger, Jr., Commander, U.S. Army Special Operations Command (Airborne) (USASOC), conduct a third investigation. LTG Kensinger appointed a subordinate, Brigadier General (BG) Gary M. Jones, Commander, U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne), to conduct the investigation. BG Jones' investigation was more thorough than the first two, included an on-site visit, and was pronounced legally sufficient by LTG Kensinger's Staff Judge Advocate in January 2005. Notwithstanding our conclusions with respect to these three investigations, we emphasize that all investigators established the basic facts of CPL Tillman's death -- that it was caused by friendly fire, that occupants of one vehicle in CPL Tillman's platoon were responsible, and that circumstances on the ground at the time caused those occupants to misidentify friendly forces as hostile. None of the investigations suggested that CPL Tillman's death was other than accidental. Our review, as well as the investigation recently completed by the Army CID, obtained no evidence contrary to those key findings.CPL Tillman's family members were not told of the investigations and subsequent fratricide determination until 35 days after CPL Tillman's death, despite Army regulations that require next of kin be advised of additional information concerning a Service member's death as that information becomes available. Because CPL Tillman's regimental commander desired to keep information concerning the death "close hold" until investigative results were finalized, no "supplemental reports" were issued to correct initial reports that CPL Tillman's death was caused by enemy fire. Although LTG Kensinger knew friendly fire was suspected and under investigation before he served as the Army representative at CPL Tillman's memorial service on May 3, 2004, he decided to withhold notification from family members until all facts concerning the incident could be verified."
  
  BG Jones testified that he determined Pat's friend destroyed his personal items because: (1) CPL Tillman's death had already been established as fratricide by Service members who performed the destruction and who, therefore, saw no need to retain evidence; (2) the retained items were
permeated with blood and posed a biological hazard." This, however, did go against DoD regulations on evidence prevervation—consequently, those Rangers were kicked out of the Military, among other punishments. Lastly, two independent forensic reviews concluded under CID, that the two deaths were accidental, and that tight groupings of the bullets are very much possible and common, especially when mounted.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/16/2001955054/-1/-1/1/TILLMAN_REDACTED_WEB_0307-1.PDF)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.c-span.org/video/?197332-1/findings-corporal-tillman-death)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/LLI/Ethics/Leadership%20Ethics%20LOW%20Discussion%20Guide%20Minus%20Hadith%202008.pdf?ver=2018-09-25-100015-853#page=126)</sup></sup>

- On April 8, 2003, an American tank fired a shell on the hotel, killing two journalists, Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk and José Couso of Telecinco Spanish television. Contrary to conspiracy theorists, this was not a war crime. Per the results of an independent investigation: By 7 April, Coalition forces had begun to encircle Baghdad and had initiated thrusts into the city. On 8 April, Coalition forces were pushing into Baghdad and being met with fierce enemy resistance. The enemy was operating throughout the civilian areas of the city, firing a spectrum of weapons at Coalition forces from the roofs and windows of surrounding buildings. The enemy was fighting without any regard to civilians or civilian structures. Coalition forces continued to fight their way toward the Tigris River, just across from the Palestine Hotel, an area of significant enemy contact. The eighth of April was a day of very intense fighting for A Company, 4-64 Armor. Their immediate mission was to secure an intersection and deny the enemy the use of the Jamurohora Bridge. On A Company's first attempt to secure the intersection they were met with heavy enemy direct and indirect fire from Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), mortars and small arms originating from prepared defensive positions (bunkers) and from within and atop surrounding buildings. As they approached the intersection, they suffered two Wounded in Action (WIA). The intersection was defended by almost a battalion of Iraqi Republican Guards. Fire was so intense that A Company pulled back and requested Close Air Support (CAS) and additional fire support. An A-1O aircraft dropped a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and strafed the enemy. A Company reattacked. The enemy continued to resist with much of their fire coming from the opposite bank of the Tigris River. Spot reports were continually arriving at A Company concerning increasing enemy movements and activities along the opposite side of the Tigris River. Additional reports disclosed the discovery of potent Anti-Tank missiles. At this point, A Company had been in heavy fighting for several hours. The Company Commander was then advised by his Task Force Headquarters that an enemy radio had been recovered and that enemy transmissions were being monitored. Those transmissions indicated that A Company was being observed by an enemy spotter who was located across the Tigris River and was directing enemy forces and fires in their direction. While still under heavy mortar, RPG, and missile fire, the A Company Commander directed his people to scan the surrounding buildings to try to find the enemy observer. A Company personnel observed what they believed to be a enemy hunter/killer team on the balcony of a room on the upper floors of a large tan colored building. They also witnessed flashes of light, consistent with enemy fire, coming from the same general location as the building.

  One 120mm tank round was fired at the suspected enemy observer position. Immediately following that, monitored transmissions indicated that the enemy observer was taking fire and coordinated enemy fire directed at A Company ceased. It was only some time after the incident that A Company became aware of the fact that the building they fired on was the Palestine Hotel and that journalists at the hotel had been killed or injured as a result. However, intelligence reports also indicated that the enemy used portions of the hotel as a base of operations and that heavy enemy activity was occurring in those areas in and immediately around the hotel. Conclusions: A Company was under heavy enemy attack. The company had positive intelligence that they were under direct observation from an enemy hunter/killer team. The activities on the balcony of the Palestine Hotel were consistent with that of an enemy combatant. They fired a single round in self-defense in full accordance with the Rules of Engagement. The enemy had repeatedly chosen to conduct its combat activities from throughout the civilian areas of Baghdad. These actions included utilizing the Palestine Hotel and the areas immediately around it as a platform for military operations. Baghdad was a high intensity combat area and some journalists had elected to remain there despite repeated warnings of the extreme danger of doing so."<sup>[[1]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2003/08/mil-030812-centcom02.htm)</sup></sup>

- On 30 June, 2002, in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan, recon and other coalition aircraft came under fire from a number of compounds by AAA batteries. An AC-130 was called in. There were people within this area of Oruzgan Province that regularly aimed and fired of variety of weapons at coalition aircraft. These weapons represented a real threat to coalition forces. As OFT commenced, AAA weapons were fired and, as a result, an AC-130 aircraft, acting properly and in accordance with the rules, engaged the locations of those weapons. Great care was taken to strike only those sites that were actively firing that night. While the coalition regrets the loss of innocent lives, the responsibility for that loss rests with those that knowingly directed hostile fire at coalition forces. The operators of those weapons elected to place them in civilian communities and elected to fire them at coalition forces at a time when they knew there were a significant number of civilians present.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207215250/http://www.centcom.mil/News/Reports/Investigation_Oruzgan_Province.htm)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists claim that after the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it stole money and gold from Saddam for unstated reasons. However, in reality these assets were used for reconstruction efforts, under what would eventually become known as the Commander’s Emergency Response Program (CERP). "In  March  2003,  in  the  initial  phases  of  U.S.  combat  operations  in  Baghdad,  a  large  quantity of  cash—more than $900 million in all—was discovered hidden behind  a villa belonging to one of Saddam Hussein’s key associates. In April,  President  George  W.  Bush  issued  a  memorandum  giving  DoD  the   authority to spend such cash to assist Iraqis and support reconstruction efforts. CERP, the name that would be given to this authority in June 2003, was born."<sup>[[1]](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1508.html)</sup></sup>

Another British review, in 2004, found much of the intelligence "well-founded".<sup>[[6]](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
  A Senate Intelligence Committee study found that all public statements by US officials were indeed supported by the intelligence at the time.<sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/110345)</sup></sup> Another study by the same committee found that no intelligence was fabricated, or skewed or that analysts were pressured to making an assessment—concluding, "The Committee was not presented with  any evidence that intelligence analysts changed their judgments  as a result of political pressure, altered or produced intelligence products to conform  with Administration policy, or that  anyone even attempted to coerce, influence  or pressure analysts to do so. When asked whether analysts were pressured in any way to alter their assessments  or make their judgments  conform  with Administration policies, not a single analyst answered yes."<sup>[[8]](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf#page=368)</sup></sup>

  It has been alleged in false press reports and political pundits that Rumsfeld, the Deputy Secretary, Doug Feith and others in the Defense Department distorted intelligence in order to argue that Iraq had a direct role in the 9/11 attacks, or that Iraq and al-Qaida had a stronger relationship than shown by facts known at the time, in order to propel the United States to war on false pretenses. This conspiracy theory was debunked by a 2007 DoD OIG report, management comments and a Congressional review. A seperate Congressional report found, "The analysts interviewed indicated that most of the OSD staffers' concerns had to do with the use of too many caveats to the reporting, and the "tone" of the document. Each analyst, as well as the meeting's chairman, indicated the OUSDP staffer 'played by IC rules' in terms of their participation. In other words, each point that was raised was discussed, debated, and incorporated only if there was agreement around the table."<sup>[[9]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/ousd011707.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://archive.org/details/pctegreview)</sup></sup> <sup>[[11]](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf#page=372)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://archive.org/details/osp-overview)</sup></sup>
  
  It's worthy to note the ISG uncovered information that the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) maintained throughout 1991 to 2003 a set of undeclared covert laboratories to research and test various chemicals and poisons, primarily for intelligence operations. The existence, function, and purpose of the laboratories were never declared to the UN. The IIS program included the use of human subjects for testing purposes. Chemical weapons continued to be located and destroyed from 2004 to 2011.<sup>[[13]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1307507-nytfoiarequest.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[14]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1307370/duelfer-report-volume-iii.pdf)</sup></sup> CIA's own retrospective series also concludes that Iraq's own actions, even when seemingly trying to become transparent, made them look suspicious. And of course, their often less than forthcoming on other areas raised concerns with many foreign intelligence services, not just the US and UN.<sup>[[15]](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=721802)</sup></sup>

## Interrogations/detentions 2002-2008
Due to considerable public confusion (thanks in large part to media/NGO pundits) on GWOT's detention activities, it's prudent to concisely clarify that there are 3 areas distinct from one another: 
   1) Abu Ghraib and Bagram: Had rare cases of unauthorised detainee abuse, only some of these led to death and GBH, all responsible were investigated, charged and convicted. This is where the famous photos come from. Over 60,000 total detainees were treated humanely and with respect.
   2) GTMO: had seen approved of techniques that closely followed FM 34-52, such as faked identity of interrogator, deception such as forged documents, and yelling, (though not in the ear). No enhanced techniques from CIA. 
   3) CIA blacksites: In Afghanistan, had several approved enhanced techniques that had undergone legal scrutiny from DOJ, WH and CIA. These techniques were designed to fall below the threshold of torture under US and International law.<sup>[[1]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-yoofinal.pdf#page=41)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-bybeefinal.pdf#page=52)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-margolis.pdf)</sup></sup>
    
  Neither GTMO or the CIA facilities saw cases of the abuses that were, themselves, rare at Abu and Bagram. The following entries below cover these 3 areas. It must also be noted, that while the Bush Administration found that AQ and the Taliban were not subject to the Geneva Convention as unlawful combatants, it was US Policy and its obligation under IHL to still treat detainees in accordance with the Conventions.<sup>[[4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201103234604/http://www.dia.mil/FOIA/FOIA-Electronic-Reading-Room/FOIA-Reading-Room-Detainee-Abuse/FileId/39858/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/26/items/sanchez-ig-report-pt-2/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt2.pdf#page=28)</sup></sup>
  
#### CIA Interrogations/detention (blacksites):
- Under the September 17, 2001 Memorandum of Notification, the CIA engaged in a covert program to capture, detain, and later interrogate senior AQ members. This program exampled effective oversight improvements over time, indeed, Congressional staffers notes that one CIA Black Site, "upon departing... compared the facility to both the US Military detention facility at Bagram and the facility at Guantanamo Bay. Both remarked that the facility "was markedly cleaner, healthier, more humane and better administered facility."<sup>[[6]](https://ia802305.us.archive.org/18/items/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program.pdf#page=14)</sup></sup> As found by an independent audit of CIA facilities notes, "Detainees at facilities operated by CTC/RDG are provided essentials of shelter, clothing, nourishment, and hygiene; medical and psychological examinations and treatment; limited [but high quality] dental and vision care; opportunities for physical exercise and intellectual, religious, and recreational pursuits; and daily contact with facility staff.<sup>[[7]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20887990-00000000-cia-hvd-program)</sup></sup> Detainees are held in solitary confinement in climate-controlled, lighted, aboveground, windowless cells that are equipped with a mattress, a sink, and a toilet. None of the detainees showed any apparent physical signs of mistreatment."<sup>[[8]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006541721.pdf)</sup></sup>

  The EITs used by the Agency were highly effective, thwarting a number of planned AQ attacks, contrary to the discredited SSCI majority report's allegation<sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/ssci-minoritystudy)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup> 
  
  Renditions are perfectly legal under international law.<sup>[[11]](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=luclj)</sup></sup>
  
  On January 2, 2008, Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed an Assistant United States Attorney to review prior CIA's interrogation of 101 detainees and their treatment. In his preliminary review which concluded in 2011, he found 99 cases above board with 0 abuse, mistreatment or torture under US and International law. In two cases, he found evidence warranted a full criminal investigation—that investigation closed in 2012, and found no evidence of violation of law.<sup>[[12]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-regarding-investigation-interrogation-certain-detainees)</sup></sup> <sup>[[13]](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-eric-holder-closure-investigation-interrogation-certain-detainees)</sup></sup>

  Even within CTC, any detainee reporting to be mistreated and use of unauthorised techniques were thoroughly, independently investigated. Indeed, CTC/Legal forwarded Mr. Hawsawi's complaints to the OIG. They, in turn, forwarded it to the DOJ, as the allegations as alleged, if true—would be in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. 2340A Torture.<sup>[[14]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120073426/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/0006541723.pdf)</sup></sup> All investigations found no evidence to support the allegations, however, still updated the DOJ on the matter in 2006. This, among others, shows the Agency is not afraid to self-report allegations even by detainees for investigation. It has also been falsely claimed that the CIA did "forced feeding" via the anal route as a humiliating, unauthorised technique. However, an independent review found, "Medical personnel who administered rectal rehydration did not do so as an interrogation technique or as a means to degrade a detainee but, instead, utilized the well-acknowledged medical technique to address pressing health issues." It also highlights two main points: The technique was deemed safer than using IV needles with noncompliant detainees and was considered more efficient than a naso-gastric tube; With respect to Majid Khan, in contrast to the Study's account, our records indicate Khan removed his naso-gastric tube, which posed the risk of injury and other complications. Given this dangerous behavior, rectal rehydration was considered the most appropriate means of addressing the potential harm Khan might inflict  on himself."<sup>[[15]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup>
  
- On November 2002, Gul Rahman died in CIA detention. An independent investigation found that he was not subject to torture or mistreated—that his own actions lead to his death. It reached the following conclusions: There is no evidence to suggest that Rahman's death was deliberate; There is no evidence to suggest Rahman was beaten, tortured, poisoned, strangled, or smothered; Gul Rahman's actions contributed to his own death. By throwing his last meal he was unable to provide his body with a source of fuel to keep warm. Additionally, his violent behavior resulted in his restraint which prevented him from generating body heat by moving around and brought him in direct contact with the concrete floor leading to the loss of body heat through conduction.<sup>[[16]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006555318.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
   This was also subject to an OIG investigation, and forwarded to DOJ for prosecutorial determination. DOJ notified it would not charge, but would include it in an ongoing special counsel review by the Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. An independent study of the RDI program found that in addition to OIG investigations and criminal prosecutions—including the extensive multi-year investigation of RDI activity by a DOJ special prosecutor, which reviewed more than 100 detainee cases—CIA convened six accountability proceedings, either at the directorate or higher level, from 2003 to 2012. These reviewed assessed the performance of 30 individuals (staff officers and contractors), and 16 were deemed accountable and sanctioned. OIG conducted two seperate major reviews and at least 29 seperate investigations of alleged misconduct. Some of these reviews were self-initiated by Agency components responsible for managing the program. CIA made numerous referrals to the OIG relating to the conduct of Agency officers and their treatment of detainees, during the life of the program as well as after. When actions appeared to violate criminal prohibitions, referrals were made to the DOJ. In total, OIG conducted nearly 60 investigations on RDI-related matters. In over 50, OIG found the allegations to be unsubstantiated or otherwise did not make findings calling for accountability review. Of the remaining cases, one resulted in a felony conviction, one resulted in termination of a contractor, and revocation of his security clearances, and six led to accountability reviews.<sup>[[17]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup>
  
- In 2003, the US detained Ammar al-Baluchi, an AQ operative, whose interrogation sessions provided key details on senior AQ members, disrupting plots, etc.<sup>[[18]](https://archive.org/details/ssci-minoritystudy)</sup></sup> When Ammar was transfered to GTMO, he alleged a number of various abuses against him, however, an independent IG investigation that resulted from those allegations, concluded: That he was not hit in the head with a bar or pipe; That he was not given a vaccination that made him crazy; That he was not hit on hise nose, causing it to bleed; That he was not kept in a freezing cell; That he was not threatened sexually. The review also notes that all blacksites providing a high quality care: Providing Halal meals, personal video games, books, movies, and religious items, etc. Each cell contained an in-room personal shower, gym, Koran and was climate-controlled (heater/aircon). The facilities were sterile, clean—efficient, modern–invoking a surreal feeling. During routine, monthly doctor checkups, Baluchi had two teeth fillings. In 2004, due to his fasting, fainted in his cell, causing a head injury—about half an inch long to the back side of the head.<sup>[[19]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21416908/exhibit-c-baluchi.pdf)</sup></sup>  
  
- Around January 2004, the CIA detained Khalid' Abd al-Razzaq al-Masri, a German citizen. This, however was an error. Not a case of mistaken identity, but a lack of intelligence to justify holding him. It was believed he was a known HVI, who goes by the alias, Khalid al-Masri. However, by mid March it was determined he should be released. The German Government was notified and he was sent back clandestinely, in May 2004. Post-release, he levied a number of accusations against the CIA. That he was sodomized, beaten, injected with drugs, and forced fed. These claims were investigated, among other things such as how he was wrongfully detained by an independent Inspector General review, which finds: "OIG's investigation found no credible information that al-Masri was subjected to physical abuse of any kind while in CIA custody. Evidence gathered during the investigation suggests that the experience that gave rise to al-Masri's allegation he was sodomized was, in fact, a routine rectal examination conducted by a physician's assistance during his initial medical examination. He ended his hunger strike when faced with the possibility of being force-fed. In keeping with standard practice for flight safety, al-Masri was restrained with flex cuffs, his eyes were covered, and he had noise suppression muffs over his ears. In consideration of CTC/RDG's request, however, al-Masri was not forced to wear a diaper (a sanitary measure for flight risks), and he was permitted to use the toilet and drink water. Al-Masri also did not wear the usual sweat clothes but wore civilian clothing specifically for him by CTC/RDG officers.<sup>[[20]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006541725.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Some conspiracy theorists try to suggest that the ECHR ruling on the matter is evidence of torture against al-Masri, however, it could be noted: The EU Court was a civil case—which uses lower standards of evidence. ECHR had no access to medical records from the period. The medical records (photos, scans, etc) that the IG report had access to, as well as physically seeing the detain themselves at the time, confirmed there was no abuse. The civil case relied only on testimony by Dr. Porterfield, who had only several phone calls with Khalid, and concluding that he had PTSD. However, Porterfield recommended seeing for a formal evaluation, in person. al-masri, of course declined. He didn't wan't to be caught in a lie. As for abuse/torture, 0 evidence was proffered nor examined by ECHR.

- On May 12, 2004, CIA Deputy Director McLaughlin, in closed testimony corrected the record to Congress that CIA was not involved in any of the photos seen that leaked to the media, of unauthorised detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. He said, "We are not authorised in the program to do anything like what you have seen in those photographs."<sup>[[21]](https://archive.org/details/may-12-2004-ddcia-testimony)</sup></sup> As noted by the Office of Medical Services (OMS) on the RDI program during their review, "The empirical record affirmed effectiveness and, through the presence of OMS, the safety of the program. Finally, critically and urgency  each received case-by-case analysis from CTC. Though imperfect this review nonetheless limited the application of EITs to less than a third of the detainees who came into Agency hands, and further limited the use of the most aggressive techniques to only 5 or 6 of the highest value detainees. A criterion  of"'necessity" also requires that no aggressive measure be used when a lesser measure would suffice."<sup>[[22]](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5301943/CIA-OMS-Summary.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Contrary to conspiracy theorists, it's a myth that Maher Arar was subject to CIA's rendition program to Syria. He was sent to Syria, as he was denied entry. Nothing more. En route from Zurich, Arar was identified in the Department of State's (DOS) "TIPOFF" system as a "special interest" alien who was suspected of affiliations to terrorist activity and was described as "armed and dangerous." The TIPOFF database, at the time of Arar's arrival in the United States, was the principal database containing names of known and suspected terrorists. If an INS inspector queried the TIPOFF system with passenger information from the Advance Passenger Information System and a match occurred, the INS inspector would receive a message that the alien was the subject of a lookout. A lookout is an entry in one of several immigration and security databases that lists previously deported aliens, criminal aliens, or other aliens who were of interest to law enforcement agencies. If an alien is the subject of a lookout, this is an indication that an alien might be inadmissible to the United States and requires additional review at a U.S. port of entry (POE). Before Arar arrived at JFK, a team from the New York Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) was dispatched to interview Arar upon his arrival at JFK.

  Arar was determined by INS to be inadmissible to the United States on the grounds that he was a member of a foreign terrorist organization. On Tuesday, October 8, 2002, Arar was transported by an INS "Special Response Team" to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, where he was flown by private aircraft to Dulles International Airport near Washington, DC. At Dulles, an INS "special removal unit" boarded the plane, then accompanied Arar to Amman, Jordan, where he arrived on Wednesday, October 9,2002. Arar was later transferred to the custody of Syrian officials. DHS's IG investigated the matter twice, as did DOJ's OPR. Courts also examined. All refuted allegations made by Arar that the Government sent him to be tortured for information, and that the CIA was involved. An independent panel, studying US transfers, concluded, "In the cases of U.S. transfers under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, the United States transfer policies to date have, to the Task Force's knowledge, met or exceeded the relevant U.S. treaty obligations."<sup>[[23]](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/PDFs/The%20Removal%20of%20a%20Canadian%20Citizen%20to%20Syria%20%28Redacted%29.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[24]](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mgmt/OIGa_08-18_Mar10.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[25]](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/2009_report_special_task_force_interrogation_and_transfer_policies/download)</sup></sup> 
  
- It has been alleged by several media outlets and NGOs that the CIA had several of the named individuals below in CIA custody, however, A review of FBI, CIA and DoD documents confirms none of these individuals were in CIA custody: Khalid Al-Zawahiri; Osama Bin Yousaf; Qari Saifullah Akhtar; Walid bin Azmi; Iban Al Yaquti al Sheikh al-Sufiyan; Amir Hussein Abdullah al-Misri; Safwan al-Hasham; Jawad al Bashar and Saif Al-Islam Al-Masri.<sup>[[26]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20392756-savage-nyt-foia-redacted-durham-report-to-holder-on-cia-detainees-not-in-cia-custody)</sup></sup>

- Political pundits allege that the CIA deliberately destroyed 92 interrogation tapes to hide from accountability, for supposedly showing torture. This makes no sense logically with timelines of various events. It has also been alleged that Gina Haspel played a role in their destruction, and ran a blacksite. Both are not true.  On 30 Nov, 2002, an independent attorney viewed the video tapes, they examined logbooks, notebooks and other materials, and all other relevant material and confirmed that the cable traffic accurately described the, interrogation methods employed and that the methods conformed to the applicable legal and policy guidance. Destruction for the tapes, out of concern the footage or stills from the video, would be leaked online, with the faces of CIA personnel, putting them in danger, was approved on 8 Nov, 2005. By this time, however, the CIA's IG had already reviewed the footage, in 2003, and all cables, notes and other material. The IG found only 12 tapes contained footage of EIT use. 82 uses of waterboarding were identified, most lasting no more than 10 seconds. 11 tapes were blank aside from two tapes for 1-2 minutes. A review of the episode found, "no fault with the performance of Ms. Haspel. I have concluded that she acted appropriately in her role as Mr. Rodriguez's Chief of Staff... she drafted the cable on the direct orders of Mr. Rodriguez; she did not release that cable. It was not her decision to destroy the tapes; it was Mr Rodriguez's." He said his reason for the decision to destroy the tapes was due to the world's reaction of the photos concerning the rare, unauthorised detainee abuse by a few Military personnel at Abu Ghraib and that, "... never denied making the decision to destroy the tapes nor did he ever attempt to cover up his decision in any way. On the contrary, from day one Mr. Rodriguez admitted his decision and has been consistent in his explanation." However, there were some that remained, in the discovery process in the EDVA, 4th Cir of Appeals, two video tapes and one audio tape were found. For the purpose of the litigation, DOJ reviewed the tapes and provided transcripts to the Court, Ex Parte. Moussaoui was not mentioned in the tapes at all—thus irrelevant to the case—however, critically, they also independently found the cables describing the interrogations, and intelligence from them, match the tapes accurately: "At our request, CIA also provided us with intelligence cables pertaining to the interviews recorded on the two tapes. Because we reviewed these cables during our discovery review, we wanted to ensure that the cables accurately captured the substance of the interrogations. Based on our comparison of the cables to the videotapes, and keeping in mind that the cables were prepared for the purpose of disseminating intelligence, we found that the intelligence cables accurately summarized the substance of the interrogations in question."<sup>[[27]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5673422-Gina-C-Haspel-CIA-Career-Timeline.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[28]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4414871/2011-02-15-Dkt-450-32-Exhibit-31.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[29]](https://ia902503.us.archive.org/28/items/AZinterrogation/Document-04-CIA-Interrogation-of-Abu-Zubaydah.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup> <sup>[[30]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4443609/Morell-Memo.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[31]](https://ia601406.us.archive.org/33/items/cia04special_review/cia_2004special_review.pdf#page=43)</sup></sup> <sup>[[32]](https://coop.vaed.uscourts.gov/moussaoui/dktsheets/docs/72587/0.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[33]](https://www.propublica.org/article/cia-cables-detail-its-new-deputy-directors-role-in-torture)</sup></sup>

- On the harshest technique, the waterboarding, it should be noted that the last use ended in March 2003, and only used on 3 detainees: KSM, Al Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah. Further, its use in reality and what mental pictures people develop when they hear of waterboarding are two very different things. The CIA crafted it carefully to fall well below the threshold of torture: the waterboard may be approved for use with a given detainee only during, at most, one single 30-day period, and that during that period, the waterboard technique may be used on no more than five days. In any 24-hour period, interrogators may use no more than two "sessions" of the waterboard on a subject—with a "session" defined to mean the time that the detainee is strapped to the waterboard—and that no session may last more than two hours. Moreover, during any session, the number of individual applications of water lasting 10 seconds or longer may not exceed six. As noted above the maximum length of any application of water is 40 seconds (this maximum has rarely been reached). Finally, the total cumulative time of all applications of whatever length in a 24-hour period may not exceed 12 minutes.<sup>[[34]](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/886271/download)</sup></sup>

- The EITs used by the Agency were highly effective, thwarting a number of planned AQ attacks, contrary to the discredited SSCI majority report's allegation. The following are examples of such:

  "The Study makes a number of claims related to the accuracy of the information provided by the CIA about Abu Zubaydah to OLC. First, the Study asserts that the OLC "relied on inaccurate CIA representations about Abu Zubaydah's status in al-Qa'ida and the interrogation team's 'certain|y' that Abu Zubaydah was withholding information about planned terrorist attacks." We found that the information relied upon by the Study to criticize the CIA's representations about Abu Zubaydah withholding information about planned terrorists attacks neglected to include important statements from within that same intelligence cable, which supported those representations by the CIA. Specifically, the Study cites an email from the CIA's interrogation team that included the sentence: "our assumption is the objective of this operation [the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah] is to achieve a high degree of confidence that [Abu Zubaydah] is not holding back actionable information concerning threats to the United States beyond that which [Abu Zubaydah] has already provided." However, this carefully chosen text omits critical statements from later in the same cable: "[t]here is information and analysis to indicate that subject has information on terrorist threats to the United States" and "he is an incredibly strong willed individual which is why he has resisted this long." Second, the Study asserts the CIA assessment that Abu Zubaydah was the "third or fourth man" in al-Qa'ida was "based on single-source reporting that was recanted prior to the August 1, 2002, OLC memorandum." The CIA was in possession of multiple threads of intelligence supporting Abu Zubaydah's prominent role in al-Qa' ida. However, the level of detail that had previously provided about Abu Zubaydah undermined his later attempts to retract his earlier admissions about his involvement in future terrorist attacks [redacted] and his denials about meeting with Abu Zubaydah. Moreover, Abu Zubaydah himself admitted to at least one meeting with [redacted] which undermines [redacted] denials about such meetings. Third, the Study incredibly claims that "[The CIA later concluded that Abu Zubaydah was not a member of al-Qa'ida." We found that the one document cited by the Study did not support this unbelievable and factually incorrect assertion. Specifically, a text box in this cited intelligence product makes the following assertions: A common misperception in outside articles is that Khaldan camp was run by al-qa'ida. Pre-911 September 2001 reporting miscast Abu Zubaydah as a "senior al-Qa' ida lieutenant," which led to the inference that the Khaldan camp he was administering was tied to Usama Bin Ladin  Al-Qa' ida rejected Abu Zubaydah's request in 1993 to join the group and that Khaldan was not overseen by Bin Ladin's organization.  The Study fails to state that the interrogation of this supposed "non-member" resulted in 766 sole-source disseminated intelligence reports by the Study's own count. Ironically, this intelligence product was written based on information from detainees and captured documents"—including from Abu Zubaydah.

  The Thwarting of the Dirty Bomb/Tall Buildings Plot and the Capture of Jose Padilla. "CIA records clearly indicate that sleep deprivation played a significant role in Abu Zubaydah's identification of Jose Padilla as an al-Qa'ida operative tasked to carry out an attack against the United States. Abu Zubaydah provided this information to FBI agents during an interrogation session that began late at night on April 20, 2002, and ended on April 21, 2002. Between April 15,2002 and April 21, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was deprived of sleep for a total of 126.5 hours (5.27 days) over a 136 hour (5.6 day) period—while only being permitted several brief sleep breaks between April 19, 2002 and April 21, 2002, which totaled 9.5 hours. This particular Study claim gives the false impression that enhanced interrogation techniques played no role in obtaining important threat information about Jose Padilla during the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah on April 20-21, 2002, and implies that such information was really just the result of the "rapport-building" techniques used by the FBI agents that evening. The CIA documentary record is clear that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to an extended period of sleep deprivation and other enhanced interrogation techniques during his interrogation between April 15, 2002 and April 21, 2002. Specifically, during this time period when FBI agents and CIA officers were working together in rotating, round-the-clock shifts, some of the interrogation techniques used on Abu Zubaydah included nudity,136 liquid diet, sensory deprivation, and extended sleep deprivation. The sleep deprivation of Abu Zubaydah began on April 15, 2002. By April 19, 2002, Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to 76 straight hours of sleep deprivation in the form of intensive interrogation sessions and his ability to focus on questions and provide coherent answers appeared to be compromised to a point where sleep was required. Abu Zubaydah was allowed three hours of sleep at that time. On April 20, 2002, the FBI began its late-night interrogation shift at approximately 10:30 p.m. with Abu Zubaydah and continued until about 7:00 a.m. the next morning. During that shift, Abu Zubaydah was given a two-hour sleep break; time for prayer, food, and water; and a medical check-up. By April 21, 2002, the day he identified Jose Padilla as a terrorist inside the United States, CIA records indicate that Abu Zubaydah had only been permitted several brief sleep breaks between April 19, 2002 and April 21, 2002, which only totaled 9.5 hours of sleep over a 136-hour period. That means Abu Zubaydah had been sleep deprived for a total of 126.5 hours (5.27 days) over a 136-hour (5.6 day) period by the time his FBI interrogators were finished with him at the end of that shift. A CIA chart, not included in the Study, which describes both the standard and enhanced techniques used on Abu Zubaydah, notes for April 21, 2002, "two sessions; sleep deprivation (136 hours)" under the heading "enhanced techniques " Moreover, the FBI interrogator, identified in the press as, who was questioning Zubaydah at the time he provided the Padilla information, told the OIG that "during the CIA interrogations Zubaydah 'gave up' Jose Padilla and identified several targets for future al-Qaeda attacks." In other words, while Special Agent obtained the information on Padilla, it was during a period that the FBI and CIA officers were using the CIA's techniques. 

  When the CIA and FBI interrogators entered the room late on the night of April 20, 2002, Abu Zubaydah was totally naked. He had been subjected to at least four days of dietary manipulation and had been deprived of 126.5 hours of sleep during the past 136 hours. According to FBI Special Agent Ali Soufan, they gave him a towel. They took some Coke and tea into the room and "started talking about different things." Sometime during the next morning, Abu Zubaydah "came back to his senses and he started cooperating again. And this is when he gave us Padilla." Rather than concede that Abu Zubaydah was being subjected to a combination of at least three enhanced interrogation techniques while the FBI agents were using an additional rapport-building technique, the Study includes this perplexing footnote text: While Abu Zubaydah was subjected to nudity and limited sleep deprivation prior to this date by the CIA, he had been allowed to sleep prior to being questioned by the FBI officers, who were exclusively using rapport-building interrogation techniques when the information was acquired." Like the claim in this case study, this footnote is simply at odds with what really happened. There is no reasonable way to reconcile these facts with the claim that enhanced interrogation techniques played "no role" in Abu Zubaydah's identification of Jose Padilla. Sleep deprivation for 126.5 hours over a 136-hour period-which was hardly "limited" —was an enhanced interrogation technique regardless of whether the Department of Justice formally labeled it as such a couple of months later. The Study cannot dismiss the use of these enhanced interrogation techniques simply because they were used before the Department of Justice eventually approved them. The Study's assertion that the FBI was "exclusively" using rapport-building techniques fails to recognize the reality that this interrogation technique was used in combination with at least three other enhanced interrogation techniques. In judging what caused Abu Zubaydah to give up valuable intelligence, including information on Jose Padilla, it is impossible to separate or disaggregate enhanced interrogation techniques from rapport-building techniques after enhanced techniques are applied. Enhanced interrogation techniques are designed to compel detainees to cooperate with questioning and are used in conjunction with traditional questioning methods or interrogation techniques. The simple fact is that Abu Zubaydah gave up Padilla during that interrogation, after being subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. It is simply not factually accurate for the Study to claim that Abu Zubaydah gave up the information on Padilla before he was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Nor is it factually accurate to claim that enhanced interrogation techniques played no role in identifying Padilla as a terrorist threat. The direct refutation of this Study claim illustrates the Study's flawed analytical methodology. As we detail in many of the case studies below, Zubaydah provided much of the key initial information that caused the Intelligence Community to recognize the significance of certain events, future threats, terrorist networks, and even potential assets. The Study repeatedly and incorrectly alleges that the FBI obtained this information prior to the application of CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. As a result, this mistaken allegation is taken as a settled premise in the Study's analysis of other case studies and related issues, which has the practical effect of undermining the Study's analyses of those matters. 

  Under its flawed methodology, the Study was able to disregard the significance of the large amount of information provided by Abu Zubaydah between April 15, 2002 and August 4, 2002, by incorrectly categorizing it as not being obtained from the use enhanced interrogation techniques. We now know that all of the information obtained from Abu Zubaydah on and after April 15, 2002, was provided after he had been subjected to enhanced interrogation. The practical result of this fact is that information obtained from Abu Zubaydah after April 15, 2002, can no longer be disregarded by the Study and must be factored into the assessment of the executive branch's effectiveness claims concerning the enhanced interrogation techniques along with the significant amount of important information obtained from Zubaydah following his second period of enhanced interrogation, which began on August 4, 2002. Given the breadth of the information provided by Abu Zubaydah after April 15, 2002, and its attendant impact on subsequent intelligence efforts by the United States government and its allies, we conclude that this information supports the CIA's specific representations about the effectiveness of its Detention and Interrogation Program, including the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, in relation to the thwarting of the Dirty Bomb/Tall Buildings plot and the capture of Jose Padilla.

  The Capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. "CIA records demonstrate that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques during two separate periods in April 2002 and August 2002. During these timeframes, Abu Zubaydah made several photographic identifications of Ramzi bin al-Shibh and provided information that bin al-Shibh had been in Kandahar at the end of 2001, but was then working with KSM in Karachi, Pakistan. More important, Abu Zubaydah provided information about how he would go about locating Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa'ida associates in Karachi. This information caused Pakistani authorities to intensify their efforts and helped lead them to capture Ramzi bin al-Shibh and other al-Qa'ida associates during the Karachi safe house raids conducted on September 10-11, 2002. On April 18, 2002, during Abu Zubaydah's first period of enhanced interrogation, an FBI interrogator showed him a photograph of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. According to the FBI, Abu Zubaydah said that he knew the man in the photograph as "Ramzi bin al-Shiba" and that he had seen him with a group of Arabs shortly after a missile strike in Kandahar, Afghanistan, on the house of Taib Agha, Mullah Omar's secretary. This information appears to place bin al-Shibh in Kandahar in the November 2001 timeframe, roughly five months prior to this interview with Abu Zubaydah. On June 2, 2002, the FBI again showed Abu Zubaydah a photograph of bin al-Shibh. This time Abu Zubaydah provided some additional information, stating that he knew this man as "Al-Sheeba," whom he saw with KSM in Kandahar around December 2001, near the end of Ramadan. He also noted that al-Shibh speaks Arabic like a Yemeni and that he had seen al-Shibh in the media after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On August 21, 2002, during his second period of enhanced interrogation, Abu Zubaydah "immediately recognized the photograph of Ramzi bin al Shibh" Abu Zubaydah mentioned that he had heard "that al-Shibh had stayed at the secret guest house in Qandahar that Mukhtar had established for the pilots and others destined to be involved in the 9/11 attacks." The Study's claim that it found "no connection" between Abu Zubaydah's reporting and Ramzi bin al-Shibh's capture is the result of poor analysis. On August 20, 2002, during his second period of enhanced interrogation, when asked how he would find his former al-Qa'ida associates if he were set free, Abu Zubaydah told CIA interrogators that he would contact the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, who could put him in touch with Hassan Ghul and other senior al-Qa' ida members. 5S The Study frames this interchange much more narrowly. It asserts that "Abu Zubaydah was asked specifically how he would find Hassan Ghul. In response, Abu Zubaydah provided corroborative reporting: that Hassan Ghul could possibly be located through a well-known associate. "This narrow framing of the question and response enables the Study to conclude incorrectly that the capture of bin al-Shibh was an "unexpected" result of the raids that failed to capture Hassan Ghul. The Study's approach fails to understand the causal link between Abu Zubaydah's information and the successful Karachi safe house raids of September 11, 2002, which resulted in the collection of important intelligence information and the capture of 11 al-Qa'ida associates, including Ramzi bin al-Shibh. About six weeks before Abu Zubaydah identified the significancef the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, Pakistani authorities [redacted] raided the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul's home [redacted] in early July 2002. The well-known associate of Hassan Ghul was interviewed on the spot and cooperated with Pakistani authorities [redacted] The well-known associate of Hassan Ghul even sent [redacted] with the Pakistani officers to identify a home where Hassan Ghul formerly resided. The CIA officers observed that the location was "extremely close to (if not an exact match)" to a location where KSM once resided, according to a June 18, 2002, report from the FBI. 

  The Study dismisses Abu Zubaydah's identification of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul as mere "corroborative reporting," and does not attach the appropriate significance to this information because of its rigid adherence to its flawed analytical methodology, which presumes that anything corroborative cannot be considered as "otherwise unavailable actionable intelligence." The facts tell a different story. Abu Zubaydah was a recognized senior member of al-Qa'ida who had direct ties to multiple high-ranking terrorists, including Usama Bin Ladin. The CIA was focused on Hassan Ghul, another well-connected senior member of al-Qa' ida, and "other" al-Qa' ida associates of Abu Zubaydah. Therefore, Abu Zubaydah's disclosures were deemed by the CIA as significant and actionable intelligence. When Abu Zubaydah identified the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul as the first person he would contact to reconnect with Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa'ida associates, it is very likely that collecting additional intelligence from the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul became a top operational priority for U.S. and Pakistani officials. It is not surprising that CIA Headquarters on August 29, 2002 reported that Pakistani officials had re-interviewed the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul an unknown number of times and that these officials noted that at times the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul contradicted himself. On September 9, 2002, Pakistani officials returned to the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul's home and interviewed another well-known associate of Hassan Ghul who had recently returned to The other well-known associate of Hassan Ghul cooperated and disclosed the location of Hassan Ghul's apartment, which was promptly raided but found to be empty. Pakistani authorities interviewed and learned that while Hassan Ghul had vacated the apartment, he was scheduled to return to the complex The Pakistani authorities subsequently placed the complex under surveillance in an effort to capture Hassan Ghul. On September 10, 2002, Pakistani authorities arrested two individuals believed to be Hassan Ghul and his driver outside of the apartment complex. These individuals turned out to be Muhammad Ahmad Ghulam Rabbani, a.k.a. Abu Badr and Muhammad Madni, Abu Badr's driver.  Information obtained from Madni led to a series of raids on Scptember 11, 2002, by Pakistani authorities of the identified safe house, resulting in the arrest of 11 individuals, including Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Abdul Rahim Gulam Rabbani, Hassan Muhammad Ali bin Attash, and other al-Qa' ida members. These raids also resulted in the collection of important al-Qaida operational documents, including financial records and the coded "perfume letter."

  The Study's claims with respect to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh do not hold up under a close examination of the CIA documentary record. There was a direct causal connection between the information provided by Abu Zubaydah during his second period of enhanced interrogation and bin al-Shibh's capture. Abu Zubaydah had informed his interrogators that bin al-Shibh was one of KSM's operatives in Karachi. Zubaydah confirmed the importance the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul to locate Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa' ida associates operating in Karachi, including bin al-Shibh. Since the Study's claims on this topic do not hold up to factual scrutiny, its criticisms of the CIA representations with respect to Ramzi bin al-Shibh and President Bush's references to bin al-Shibh in his September 6, 2006, speech on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program are not valid. The CIA said Abu Zubaydah's "knowledge of al-Qa'ida lower-level facilitators, modus operandi and safehouses ... played a key role in the ultimate capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh " Far from a "misrepresentation." that statement was completely accurate and consistent with the circumstances that led to bin al-Shibh's ultimate capture. Similarly, the text in President Bush's September 6, 2006, speech on the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program noting that "the information Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of Binalshibh" was also accurate.' The capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh and the other al-Qa'ida terrorists during raids of September 10-11, 2002, were stunning operational successes, made possible, in part, by the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program.

  The Capture of Khalid Shaykh Mohammad. "Information obtained from CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah was essential to furthering the CIA's understanding of KSM's role in the September 11,2001, terrorist attacks and helped lead to the capture of Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Interrogations of bin al-Shibh and DETAINEE R provided key insights about KSM. Information produced through detainee interrogation was pivotal to the retention of a key CIA asset whose cooperation led directly to the capture of KSM. The Study almost exclusively attributes the capture of KSM to a "unilateral ClA asset." We agree with the Study that this asset provided information that was crucial to KSM's capture in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on March 1, 2003. We also acknowledge that the CIA had met with the asset as early as fall 2001 and that the asset had provided good intelligence information related to KSM. However, the Study fails to acknowledge the cascading sequence of revelations that began with Abu Zubaydah's identification of the importance of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul and culminated in the information provided by the asset which led directly to the capture of KSM. Moreover, the Study does not recognize that, but for the fortuitous intervention of a CIA officer-who was aware of recently obtained detainee information which corroborated the asset's claims concerning KSM the asset would have been terminated as a CIA source prior to providing the crucial pre-capture information about KSM. 

  The Disruption of the Karachi Hotels Bombing Plot. "CIA documents show that key intelligence collected through the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, including information obtained after the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, played a major role in disrupting the Karachi hotels bombing plot. Our analysis will demonstrate that the intelligence collected through the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program, including information obtained after the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, played a key role in the disruption of the Karachi hotels bombing plot. The Study notes that the CIA had information regarding the Karachi terrorist plotting as early as September 11, 2002, in the form of the "perfume letter," which was obtained during a raid of a safe house in Karachi, Pakistan. What the Study fails to point out, however, is that Abu Zubaydah provided crucial information which played a big role in leading to the i raids of the al-Qa'ida safe houses on September 11, 2002 — the same raids that yielded the "perfume letter" and disrupted the Karachi hotels plot. Specifically, Pakistani raids were the direct result of information provided by Abu Zubaydah on August 20, 2002, during his second period of enhanced interrogation. When asked how he would go about finding his former al-Qa'ida associates if he were set free, Abu Zubaydah told CIA interrogators that he would contact a well-known associate of Hassan Ghul who could put him in touch with Ghul and other senior al-Qa'ida members. CIA officers then asked Pakistani officials to question the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, who on September 7, 2002, provided vague information the Pakistanis assessed was untruthful. The Pakistanis continued to watch the residence and, when another well-known associate of Hassan Ghul returned to the residence, questioned the other well-known associate of Hassan Ghul as well. The other well-known associate of Hassan Ghul cooperated and provided the location of Ghul's last apartment. This information led to the arrest, on September 9, 2002, of an individual thought to be Ghul, but who turned out to be another al-Qa'ida terrorist. Abu Zubaydah then positively identified this terrorist as Abu Badr, "KSM's driver and KSM's man in Karachi," facilitating the movement of al-Qa'ida operatives. Badr's driver, who was also arrested, identified information about several al-Qa'ida safehouses and residences in Karachi. Based on this information, on September 11, 2002, [redacted] conducted  raids, which resulted in the arrests of several terrorists and key documents, including one dubbed the "perfume letter" because the word "perfumes" was used as a codeword. In this May 2002 letter, KSM told Hamza Zubayr, a terrorist killed in the same raids, he would provide him with $30,000, with another $20,000 available upon request, and that "we have acquired the green light that is strong for the [hotels]" clearly indicating a plot of some kind." More troubling, the letter suggested "[increasing] the number to make it three instead of one." Were it not for Abu Zubaydah's original information about the significance of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul, which led to the Karachi safe house raids, it is unclear if the ''perfume letter" would ever have been found. Abu Zubaydah's value, however, did not end with providing the true significance of the well-known associate of Hassan Ghul. Zubaydah subsequently translated the "perfume letter" for the CIA, identified the key word in the letter—"hotels" —that had not been previously translated, and told the CIA that the reference to "Khallad" in the letter may be the "one legged Yemeni." A CIA analyst noted that the one-legged Yemeni was terrorist Khallad bin Attash, who was later arrested and admitted to his involvement in the plot. By early October 2002, the CIA had completed a search of the individuals identified in the "perfume letter" and concluded that most of those who had been assigned roles in support of the hotels operation had been arrested or killed by the Pakistani authorities during the September 11, 2002 raids. Although the Karachi hotels plot had been thwarted by these raids, at least one of the individuals identified by Abu Zubaydah in the letter, Khallad bin Artash, a known al-Qa' ida operative, remained at large.  Eventually, on April 28, 2003, [redacted] was able to capture several al-Qa' ida operatives, including Ammar al-Baluchi and bin Attash. [redacted] also successfully confiscated explosives, detonators, and ammunition as part of the capture operation. On May 17, 2003, Khallad bin Attash confirmed that Ammar al-Baluchi had intended to use the explosives stashed for that operation to target the U.S. Consulate. The next day, [redacted] indicated its clear understanding of how these interrelated Karachi plot events had improved the U.S. security posture in the area when it noted that although its options to enhance security: "we have seen over past months as an increased aggressiveness of local authorities have provided some protection from these threats. We point specifically to the 11 September 2002 raids in Karachi, the 1 March 2003 take-down of KSM, and to the recent arrests of al-Baluchi and ba Attash as examples of how [redacted] have thwarted attacks."

  The Identification of Bin Ladin's Courier. "CIA documents show that detainee information served as the "tip-off" and played a significant role in leading CIA analysts to the courier Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. While there was other information in CIA databases about al-Kuwaiti, this information was not recognized as important by analysts until after detainees provided information on him. In the days immediately after the Bin Ladin raid, CIA analysts and operators testified before the Committee about how they tracked down Bin Ladin. The CIA described the lead information as being provided by detainees in U.S. custody at CIA secret sites and the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and from detainees in the custody of foreign governments that helped the CIA recognize the importance of Bin Ladin's courier, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. CIA officers were clear that the information was from detainees, but never portrayed the information as originating solely from detainees held by the CIA. CIA documents show that even before the raid took place, CIA analysts prepared briefings and papers on their analysis of what led them to the courier. These briefings and papers clearly described the key role that detainee reporting played in this analytical and operational process. A CIA paper in November 2007 noted that "over twenty mid to high-value detainees have discussed Abu Ahmad's ties to senior al-Qa'ida leaders, including his role in delivering messages from Bin Ladin and his close association with former al-Qa'ida third-in-command Abu Faraj al-Libi. The report highlighted specific reporting from two detainees, Hassan Ghul and Ammar al-Baluchi, who both identified Abu Faraj al-Libi's role in communicating to Bin Ladin through Abu Ahmad. It was this and similar reporting from other detainees that helped analysts realize Abu Faraj's categorical denials that he even knew anyone named Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, "almost certainly were an attempt to protect Abu Ahmed," thus showing his importance. Additionally, a retrospective prepared by the CIA's Study for the Center of Intelligence after the raid also made clear in its report that detainee information was significant in the identification of the courier. The report noted that High-Value Terrorist analysts, targeters, and their managers told the Center that: "debriefing al-Qa' ida detainees provided them with unparalleled expertise and knowledge of the organization. The ability to cross-check detainee statements against one another-specifically Abu Faraj's with that of numerous other detainees ultimately led to the assessment that Abu Ahmad was directly serving as Bin Ladin's facilitator and possibly harboring him. In sum, 25 detainees provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, his al-Qa'ida membership, and his historic role as a courier for Bin Ladin. Nine of the 25 were held in non-CIA custody. Of the 16 held in CIA custody, all but three had given information after being subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs), although of the 13 only two (KSM and Abu Zubaydah) had been waterboarded. Even so, KSM gave false information about Abu Ahmad, as did Abu Faraj, who received lesser EITs. Ironically, the falsity of the information was itself important in establishing Abu Ahmad's significance." The Study—benefiting from the ability to search a database compiled of only information relevant to its specific task (something intelligence analysts are not able to do) with the advantage of hindsight to understand which names are now important—asserts that prior to receiving information from CIA detainees, the CIA had other critical reporting on the courier. The Study cites Abu Ahmad's phone number and e-mail address, a body of intelligence reporting linking him to KSM's operational planning, and reporting on Abu Ahmad's age, physical appearance, and family—including information the CIA would later cite as pivotal in identifying his true name.

  While it is true that the CIA was conducting technical intelligence collection linked to Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti in 2002, CIA fact-checking confirmed that this information was meaningless because: (1) it did not link Abu Ahmad to Bin Ladin; (2) Abu Ahmad had stopped using the phone number and e-mail address in 2002; and (3) Abu Ahmad was not linked to that email address in any of his subsequent correspondence. According to the CIA, "that intelligence was insufficient to distinguish Abu Ahmad from many other Bin Ladin associates until additional information from detainees put it into context and allowed us to better understand his true role and potential in the hunt for Bin Ladin." Further review of CIA records confirmed that the phone number at issue was an Inmarsat number associated with "Mukhtar" and "Ahmad 'al-Kuwahadi."According to Adam Robinson, the author of Bin Laden Behind the Mask of the Terrorist, "[a]fter a long period of use of the Inmarsat system, Osama learned that this system is open to interception, both for covert observation and possibly for homing in on the signal. After he became aware of this, he used the system only periodically for calling his mother." If this claim about Bin Ladin's belief is accurate and al-Qa'ida leadership believed that phones were vulnerable, it may explain why this particular phone number was abandoned by KSM and Abu Ahmad. The information providing Kuwaiti's physical description and family details was critical to ultimately identifying al-Kuwaiti's true name, but not until years later—2007 to be exact-after detainee reporting provided enough information about the courier that a search of old records illuminated key information in that reporting. The CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence said such information was "an unnoticed needle in the haystack on an unending plain of haystacks" until that time. One of the lead CiA analysts called similar information that later turned out to be important "meaningless" until years later when detainee reporting illuminated its importance. Thus, this information really only became critical to the CIA after detainee reporting provided enough information about the courier that a search of old records illuminated key information in that reporting. 

  Detainees who provided useful and accurate information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti and Bin Ladin had undergone enhanced interrogation prior to providing the information. For example, Hassan Ghul provided more specificity about Abu Ahmad after being transferred from COBALT and receiving enhanced interrogation techniques. The Study disputes statements from current and former CIA officials that information from detainees in CIA's enhanced interrogation program provided valuable information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. For example, then-CIA Director Leon Panetta told ABC News in May 2011, soon after the Bin Ladin raid, that enhanced interrogation techniques were used to extract information that led to the mission's success.Former Director Hayden said in an interview that '"the original lead information—and frankly it was incomplete identity information on the couriers—began with information from CIA detainees at the black sites. Both of these statements are accurate. While numerous detainees at CIA black sites provided information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, as noted above, two detainees, Hassan Ghul and Ammar al-Baluchi, in particular were cited by the lead CIA analyst as leading her to search old intelligence files. Ammar al-Baluchi, who appears to be the first detainee to mention Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti's role as a Bin Ladin courier and a possible connection with Abu Faraj al-Libi, provided this information at a CIA black site during a period of enhanced interrogation."

  CIA continues to assess that Khalid Shaykh Muhammad's (KSM) identification of Pakistani businessman Saifullah Paracha, an al-Qa'ida contact whom KSM was trying to use to smuggle explosives into the United States, was a success resulting from detainee reporting. KSM's information spurred FBI action against Paracha; prompted FBI to question his son, Uzhair; and allowed analysts to focus on the right Saifullah Paracha. Reporting from interrogations of KSM was directly and uniquely responsible for the arrests of Saifullah Paracha and his son Uzhair Paracha, both of whom KSM claimed had agreed to facilitate an al-Qa/ida plan to smuggle explosives into the United States. 198 In a 26 March 2003 cable, the FBI stated that it had taken action with regard to Saifullah and Uzhair based on KSM's debriefing disseminated 25 March. he FBI immediately watchlisted Saifullah and Uzhair and searched domestic immigration and law enforcement databases for details on their locations and activities. The FBI determined Saifullah was located in Pakistan but was able to arrest Uzhair in New York on 31 March. The StudyJs finding that CIA possessed sufficient information to identify and detain Saifullah Paracha without reporting from KSM is incorrect. We had fragmentary information suggesting that someone by the name of Saifullah Paracha might be of interest to us as a possible accomplice in an al-Qa/ida overseas financial scheme. However, we did not know which among the many people who have that name around the world to focus upon. We did not know he was involved in a potential attack on the US until KSM told us Saifullah and his son agreed to smuggle explosives into the US. The FBI found the son in New York, in their words, "based on this reporting."

  The Study says that Saifullah Paracha was already Uwell-known to the IC prior to the capture of KSM" but the only clear link the Study cites between Paracha and terrorist plotting is actually a reference to a different Saifullah Paracha.  All other references are either too vague or indirect to have been meaningful without detainee reporting, refer to a nascent investigation of terrorist use of a Paracha-affiliated business to mask financial transfers, or in many cases, also refer to a different Saifullah Paracha. The Study refers to a Saifullah Paracha who had links to Mir Aimal Kansi, the terrorist who killed two people outside CIA Headquarters in 1993. However, the Saifullah Paracha KSM reported on was more than 25 years younger and not connected to Mir Aimal Kansi. The Study cites a ulink" between Paracha and Abu Zubaydah, because Paracha's name appeared among hundreds of other names in documents confiscated in the Abu Zubaydah raid. While the CIA passed Paracha's name and information on his ties to a Karachi, Pakistan-based company with a New York office to the FBI, the Bureau did not report any further information of Interest concerning Paracha until after KSM's debriefing. The Study cites two other pieces of information on Paracha that it claims are representative of reporting available independent of the CIA detention and interrogation program. Neither report was noteworthy without KSM's information. One is an indirect connection to Paracha's business in Pakistan that Committee staff found in an undisseminated FBI case file. It was not available to CIA at the time and would not have linked Paracha to an al-Qaida operation independent of KSM's information in any case. The other report is [redacted] of Majid Khan before he was rendered [redacted] to US custody, but the report included few details and was disseminated just after KSM provided the information that allowed us to identify Paracha.

  CIA continues to assess that information from detainees in CIA custody-specifically Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM) and Abu Zubaydah-that was obtained after they were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques was important to identifying Ja'far al-Tayyar. The "key contextual facts" that the Study claims CIA omitted are incorrect: "The Intelligence Community was interested in the Florida-based Adnan al-Shukrijumah prior to the detention of the CIA Js first detainee." The only reference to Shukrijumah in CIA holdings prior to 2003 was a request for traces from FBI and a CIA response that stated, "A search of our Agency's records found no identifiable information on  Adnan Gulshair el-Shukri Jumah To support its claim, the Study cites a US District Court case file-which was not in CIA databases-that mentions Shukrijumah due to his association with a Florida-based extremist. Abu Zubaydah's information in May 2002 came after being subjected to sleep deprivation. Although sleep deprivation was not officially designated an enhanced technique in 2002, it was classified as such in 2005. This information was an initial step toward identifying the right Ja'far al-Tayyar, but we were not able to do so until KSM provided more detailed reporting. The Study implies that CIA had substantial information on Ja'far al-Tayyar by noting that we produced "a targeting study" on him in January 2003, prior to KSM's detention. However, that study was titled, "Targeting Study: Finding the Right Ja'far al-Tayyar,,,226 and the first paragraph stated, "Unfortunately, many extremists use the name of Ja'far al-Tayyar, which can be translated as 'Jafar the Pilot.' Headquarters research has identified several distinct Ja'far al-Tayyars. We very much want to confirm the locations of each of these Jafars."

  The Heathrow and Canary Wharf Plots. The CIA interrogation program played a key role in disrupting the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plotting. Despite its claim that information acquired during or after the use of enhanced interrogation techniques played "no role" in the disruption of the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plots, the Study twice concedes these plots were "fully disrupted" with the detentions of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, KSM, Ammar al-Baluchi, and Khallad bin Attash. The Study then incorrectly asserts that "It]here are no CIA records to indicate that any of the detainees was captured as a result of CIA detainee reporting."As we have previously demonstrated, information obtained from the CIA interrogation program played a key role in the capture of al-Shibh and KSM.222 Also, Ramzi bin al-Shibh provided information about Ammar al-Baluchi and Abu Zubaydah provided information about Khallad bin Attash prior to their arrests. The same detainee information that helped lead to the capture of these terrorists also played a key role in fully disrupting the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plots. Thus far, the following analytical dominoes have fallen in relation to the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plots: (1) "There is considerable evidence that the information Abu Zubaydah provided identifying KSM as "Mukhtar" and the mastermind of 9/11 was significant to CIA analysts, operators, and FBI interrogators"; (2) "Abu Zubaydah provided information about how he would go about locating Hassan Ghul and other al-Qa'ida associates in Karachi. This information caused [redacted] Pakistani authorities to intensify their efforts and helped lead them to capture Ramzi bin al-Shibh and other al-Qa' ida associates during the Karachi safe house raids conducted on September 10-11, 2002,225 (3) "Information produced through detainee interrogation was pivotal to the retention of a key CIA asset whose cooperation led directly to the capture of KSM":226 (4) Zubaydah told the CIA that the reference to "Khallad" in the letter may be the "one legged Yemeni".227 and (5) Pakistan's arrest of al-Qa'ida terrorists Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad Bin Attash disrupted the al-Qa'ida plot to attack the U.S. Consulate in Karachi.228 Taken together, these significant operational accomplishments, most of them resulting from information obtained from CIA detainees, also had the added bonus of disrupting the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plots.

  The Study undercuts its own argument that the CIA interrogation program played no role in the disruption of the Heathrow and Canary Wharf plotting almost immediately after its narrative on the plots begins. The Study says "records indicate the Heathrow Airport plotting had not progressed beyond the initial planning stages when the operation was fully disrupted with the detention of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (detained on September 11, 2002), KSM (detained on March 1, 2003), Ammar al-Baluchi (detained on April 29, 2003), and Khallad bin Attash (detained on April 29, 2003)."229 As we explained previously, Ramzi bin al-Shibh was detained as a result of information provided by Abu Zubaydah during a period of enhanced interrogation.230 By asserting that the detention of Ramzi bin al-Shibh played a role in the disruption of the plot, certainly the detainee information that led to his detention also played a role in the plot's disruption.

  The Thwarting of the Second Wave Plots and Discovery of the Al-Ghuraba Group. The CIA interrogation program played a key role in disrupting the "Second Wave" plot and led to the capture of the 17-member al-Ghuraba group. The Study asserts that because Hambali's brother, Gun Gun Ruswan Gunawan, first identified a group of 17 Malaysian and Indonesian Jemaah Islamiya (JI) affiliated students in Karachi, "the use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Hambali did not result in the 'discovery' of "the Ghuraba Cell' that was 'tasked with executing the 'Second Wave' plotting."264 While Gunawan did identify the group of JI students in Karachi, the Study ignores that KSM; who had also been subjected to the ClA's enhanced interrogation techniques, provided information months earlier on this same group of JI students and their location in Karachi —information that had helped lead to the capture of Gunawan himself. The Study also ignores information provided by other detainees in CIA's interrogation program. In April 2003, KSM provided information about Gunawan's role in Karachi as a communications conduit between Hambali and al-Qa'ida and reported that he was living in the dormitory where he was enrolled at Abu Bakr-Sadeeq University. KSM also drew a map with the location of a house he called "Colony Gate" where he met Gunawan, where he said a group of JI students would meet.266 According to CIA information, while the CIA was already aware of Gunawan, "KSM's identification of his role as Hambali's potential successor prioritized his capture. Information from multiple detainees, including KSM, narrowed down [Gunawan's] location and enabled his capture in September 2003." This information was excluded from the Study. Hambali provided very similar information after his capture in August 2003. On August 20, 2003, CIA headquarters provided information on Gunawan [redacted] "which solidly ties Rusman Gunawan to al-Qa'ida and al-Qa' ida's terrorist attacks" [redacted] The information provided was largely from interrogations of KSM, including information about Gunawan working as a communications conduit for Hambali and al-Qa'ida, his location in Karachi, a description of Gunawan, but also provided information from another detainee in CIA custody, Ammar al-Baluchi. Gunawan was arrested on [redacted] at the Abu Bakr Madrassa, locational information first provided by KSM, along with most of JI student group. After Gunawan's arrest he was caught trying to send a coded message which he admitted was intended to warn the group of Jl-affiliated students about his arrest. [redacted] participating in the interrogation recognized Gunawan's information about this group of mostly Malaysian students as similar to intelligence reporting provided previously by KSM that he was planning to recruit Malaysians in a "next wave of attacks." The officers asked that Hambali be questioned about the reporting.

  During a ClA interrogation of Hambali days later, Hambali, now in ClA custody and undergoing enhanced interrogation, provided more information about the group, identifying them as the "al-Ghuraba" group and describing how they were set up by Hambali and sent to Karachi because of its "proximity to Afghanistan and the availability of military-style training facilities there." He said the Program was designed to "give a select few the opportunity for military-style training to prepare them for jihad" and identified two who were ready for operations.276 Hambali provided information about the identities and backgrounds of several of the al-Ghuraba group members and described conversations he had with KSM about possible future attacks on the United States. In a subsequent interrogation, Hambali said the group was not yet ready for operations, but may be in 2003-2004 (it was already late 2003 when he provided this information) and he named individuals who were being groomed as suicide and other operatives. [redacted] arrested the members of the al-Ghuraba group during raids on [redacted] A cable describing the arrests said, "[We] captured this cell based on the debriefings of captured senior al-Qa'ida operatives, who stated that some members of this cell were to be part of senior al-Qal'lida leader Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM)['s] second wave operation to attack the United States using the same modus operandi as was used in the September 11, 2001 attacks."

  In a seeming effort to suggest CIA's assessment of the threat posed by the al-Ghuraba group had diminished over time, the Study identified an October 27, 2006, CIA cable that stated, "All of the members of the former al-Ghuraba cell have now been released.It also cited an April 18, 2008, CIA intelligence report focusing on the Jemaah Islamiya and referencing the al-Ghuraba group that makes no reference to the group serving as potential operatives for KSM's 'Second Wave' plotting." These statements are misleading in several ways. The April 18, 2008 intelligence report was about Jemaah Islamiya in Pakistan, not the al-Ghuraba group, and provided only a minor description of the "al-Ghuraba cell in Karachi," but did mention that its leader was in direct contact with Hambali and "al-Qa'ida external operations chief Khalid Shaykh Muhammad." The Study omitted a report focused on Jemaah Fslamiya's al-Ghuraba group published five months later diat said "members of the cell had also been identified by Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, the mastermind of the attacks of 11 September 2001, and senior al-Qa ida and Jl operative Hambali as candidates for post-11 September attacks against the U.S. Homeland," including for "second wave suicide hijacking operations in the Unites States and Europe." Far from suggesting the CIA was unconcerned about the al-Ghuraba group, this report devoted 20 pages to describing the threat from its members including their "jihad activities and the caution that "as this group of radicalized militants reconnects and mingles with other young Southeast Asian Muslims, it poses a revived threat to US and Western interests.<sup>[[35]](https://archive.org/details/ssci-minoritystudy)</sup></sup> <sup>[[36]](https://archive.org/details/review-of-senate-report)</sup></sup> 

- OLC opinions and the law—the OLC opinions on EITs ended up being completely and resoundingly correct—both with international and domestic law. The following will quote on analysis of specific intent, severe pain,  US Judicial Interpretation, and international decisions—debunking the discredited OPR report. DOJ reached similar conclusions:

  A. Specific Intent
Exhibit number one in OPR's catalogue of supposed "errors, omissions, misstatements, and illogical conclusions," F.R. at 159, in the Bybee Memo is that nemorandum's treatment of "specific intent." In examining the elements of "torture" under 18 U.S.C. § 2340A, the Bybee Memo correctly noted that the statute requires that "severe pain and suffering must be inflicted with specific intent," which it interpreted as an intent "to achieve the forbidden act." Bybee Memo at 3. Citing and quoting from the Supreme Court's then-recent decision in Carter 1. United States, 530 U.S. 255 (2000), which examined the distinction between "general" and "specific" intent in the context of the federal bank-robbery statute, the Bybee Memo then explained that Congress's use of "specific intent" in the torture statute meant that the infliction of "severe pain ... must be the defendant's precise objective.". Bybee Memo at 3. By contrast, "[i]f the defendant acted knowing that severe pain or suffering was reasonably likely to result from his actions, but no more, he would have acted only with general intent." Id. at 3-4. Thus, even if a person knows that severe pain will result from his actions, he lacks the requisite specific intent "if causing such harm is not his objective." Id. at 4. The Bybee Memo concluded by noting that "good faith" is recognized as a defense to "specific intent" crimes, but cautioned that, as a practical matter, a jury was unlikely to credit such a defendant lacked a reasonable basis for his beliefs. Id. at 4-5. This analysis does not simply vault the professional-conduct bar, it is manifestly correct. As we told OPR in our response to its Draft Report, two recent cases in the Third Circuit (one of them en banc) have adopted the Bybee Memo's analysis of specific intent. In those cases, the Third Circuit construed the definition of "torture" pursuant to regulations issued by the Department of Justice to implement the Convention Against Torture. Those regulations provide, in accordance with the United States' reservations at the time of ratification, that "[i]n order to constitute torture, an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering. An act that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and suffering is not torture." 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(5) (emphasis added). In Auguste v. Ridge, 395 F.3d 123 (3d Cir. 2005), a distinguished panel of the Third Circuit (composed of Judge Fuentes, the late Judge Becker and then-Judge Alito) concluded that the phrase "specific intent" has an "ordinary meaning" in American criminal law," and for that reason it must be construed to have that meaning, despite the immigration context in which the torture question had arisen in that case. Id. at 145. Relying, like the Bybee Memo, on Carter, Auguste then discussed the issue as follows: "The specific intent standard is a term of art that is well-known in American jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has explained that in order for an individual to have acted with specific intent, he must expressly intend to achieve the forbidden act." Id. (emphasis added). After quoting at length the same example from Carter that the Bybee Memo quoted, the Court concluded that "to constitute torture, there must be a showing that the actor had the intent to commit the act as well as the intent to achieve ... the infliction of the severe pain and suffering." Id. at 145-46 n.23 (emphasis added). That is precisely the analysis set forth in the Bybee Memo. See Bybee Memo at 4 ("a defendant is guilty of torture only if he acts with the express purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering"). Notwithstanding years of investigation and research, OPR's Draft Report completely failed to mention this case.

  In Pierre v. Attorney General, 528 F.3d 180 (3d Cir. 2008) (en banc), another torture case that somehow also had completely escaped OPR's notice in the Draft Report, the Third Circuit sat en banc to consider whether the "specific intent" requirement under the Convention Against Torture is satisfied by a mere showing that an official "knows" that it is "practically certain that [the victim] will suffer severe pain." 528 F.3d at 182-83. By a lopsided vote of 10 to 3, the court answered that question in the negative. As it had in Auguste, the Court again adverted to the ratification history, including the fact that "[both the President and the Senate indicated their understanding" that the Convention "contains a specific intent requirement." Id at 187. That "understanding," the Court noted, "has domestic legal effect." Id. The Court also reaffirmed Auguste's reliance on Carter, as well as Auguste's conclusion that specific intent to torture requires both the intent to do the act and the intent to "achieve the consequences of the act, namely the infliction of the severe pain and suffering" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 189-90 (discussing Carter and noting that "an actor who knowingly commits an act but does not intend the illegal outcome of that act, can only be held liable for a general, not specific, intent crime"). Accordingly, the court concluded, "a petitioner cannot obtain relief under the CAT unless ... [the] prospective torturer will have the goal or purpose of inflicting severe pain or suffering." Id. at 190 (emphasis added). The Court addressed the question of a defendant's knowledge as follows: We disagree that proof of knowledge on the part of government officials that severe pain or suffering will be the practically certain result ... satisfies the specific intent requirement of the CAT. Rather, we are persuaded ... that the specific intent requirement ... requires a petitioner to show that his prospective torturer will have the motive or purpose to cause him pain or suffering... Mere knowledge that a result is substantially certain to follow from one's actions is not sufficient to form the specific intent to torture. Knowledge that pain and suffering will be the certain outcome of conduct may be sufficient for a finding of general intent but it is not enough for a finding of specific intent. Id. at 189 (emphasis added).

  It would appear that an understanding similar to the Third Circuit's has prevailed in "[e]very other circuit to consider the question" under the Convention Against Torture. Villegas v. Mukasey, 523 F.3d 984, 988 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing, inter alia, Auguste); see also Pierre v. Gonzales, 502 F.3d 109, 118 (2d Cir. 2007) (noting, in another CAT case, that "the phrase 'specifically intended' incorporates a criminal 'specific intent' standard .... The President and Senate knew full well that they were construing a treaty designed to stop criminal conduct. We cannot ignore the word 'specifically' in the ratification understanding ... and we decline to give it a counter-intuitive spin."). The Bybee Memo therefore correctly interpreted the specific intent requirement of the torture statute-without the benefit of the subsequently developed body of case law addressing intent specifically in the context of torture. Its conclusions have been ratified by every court of appeals to consider the question. OPR nevertheless makes this undisputedly correct analysis the centerpiece of its argument that Professor Yoo committed professional misconduct—a telling barometer of the Final Report's overall strength. OPR's critique, the substance of which appears to be wholly lifted from secondary sources, not only is riddled with errors, but would be equally applicable to the sitting federal judges who have now adopted the Bybee Memo's interpretation of the torture statute.

  First, OPR concludes that the Bybee Memo "failed to note the ambiguity and complexity in this area of the law." F.R. at 160. To support that critique, OPR quotes snippets from decades-old Supreme Court opinions stating that distinctions between "general" and "specific" intent can be "elusive" or "difficult]." F.R. at 169-70 (citing and quoting from United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422 (1978), and United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394 (1980)). Bizarrely, OPR also notes that in Bailey the Court suggested that conventional analyses of intent might be replaced by the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, which would adopt a "hierarchy of culpable states of mind.., commonly identified, in descending order of culpability, as purpose, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence,"' F.R. at 170 (quoting Bailey, 444 U.S. at 403-04) (alteration in original), and quotes Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419 (1985), for the proposition that a "more useful instruction might relate specifically to the mental state required under [the statute in question) and eschew use of difficult legal concepts like 'specific intent' and 'general intent.'' F.R. at 170 (alteration in original). OPR cannot be serious, and if it is, cannot be taken seriously. How could anyone find fault with Professor Yoo's analysis on the theory that he should have "eschew[ed]" the "difficult legal concept" of "specific intent" in favor of the "mental state required" under the torture statute, when "specific intent" is the mental state expressly required by the statute? Analysis of this quality calls into question whether anyone at OPR has read the federal torture statute. No sane client would be interested in learning that the Supreme Court—at least as it was constituted 29 years ago-might have preferred that Congress write its laws using the terminology of the Model Penal Code when Congress, in the particular statute actually at issue, quite obviously did not do so."' Indeed, had Professor Yoo undertaken the analysis that OPR suggests, he might have been justifiably criticized for providing confusing, incompetent, and useless legal advice. The Bybee Memo was not alone in failing to ponder the potential ambiguity in "specific intent"; neither did the Third Circuit opinions in Auguste and Pierre. The en banc Court in Pierre, for example, stated succinctly that [s]pecific intent requires not simply the general intent to accomplish an act with no particular end in mind, but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose of accomplishing a specific and prohibited result." 528 F.3d at 189. Auguste treated the issue as an easy one: "specific intent" is a term of art that has a well-known meaning in American law—and it treated as self-evident the proposition that anyone would know from Carter what that meaning is. Nowhere did these cases or similar others from other circuits discuss the difficulty of interpreting "specific intent"; the en banc Third Circuit even cited Bailey as supporting the point that "'"purpose" corresponds loosely with the common-law concept of specific intent," without noting Bailey's dicta about the "difficulty" of the concept, id. at 190 (quoting Bailey, 444 U.S. at 405). Surely OPR does not mean to suggest that the federal judges writing and joining those decisions, including a current Supreme Court Justice, are guilty of professional misconduct for failing to ruminate on the supposed ambiguity in the phrase "specific intent."

  OPR's response in the Final Report to the fact that federal courts have confirmed Professor Yoo's analysis case law that OPR did not even bother to cite in its Draft Report—is that "Pierre [and the other cases were] decided long after the Bybee Memo was issued, and [have] no bearing on whether its authors presented a thorough view of the law at that time."" F.R. at 175 & n.132. In typical fashion, OPR misses the point, which is this: If Professor Yoo is guilty of misconduct for surveying the legal landscape and finding the meaning of "specific intent" in the torture statute relatively clear, why is the same not true for the federal judges who looked at the exact same precedent and conducted the exact same analysis? Our argument is not that Professor Yoo was sufficiently thorough merely because his conclusion was validated by subsequent courts, but that Professor Yoo was sufficiently thorough because his reasoning and methodology were replicated by the later judicial opinions that reached the same conclusion based on the same authorities. It appears that in OPR's world, Department of Justice attorneys must be clairvoyant enough to abide by the subjective standards of conduct promulgated by their political opponents and critics years after the event (e.g., they should have followed Johnsen's and Dellinger's "Principles Memo"), but they are to be given no credit for using the traditional tools of the legal craft to analyze a relevant legal issue, without the benefit of squarely applicable precedent in the torture context, in a manner that is subsequently vindicated by the unanimous judgment of courts of appeals that have considered the question. Indeed, although OPR does not acknowledged it, at the time the Bybee Memo issued, it was already clear that "torture can occur... only when the production of pain is purposive," that "torture requires acts both intentional and malicious," and that the defendant "must impose suffering cruelly and deliberately, rather than as the unforeseen or unavoidable incident of some legitimate end." Price v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2002).

  Here, again, OPR scours the transcripts of Professor Yoo's voluntary interviews with OPR in search of statements that it believes buttress its case. It highlights, in particular, Professor Yoo's statement that he had found the law on "intent" "confusing." F.R. at 166. Professor Yoo, of course, is not a criminal-law specialist, either as a practitioner or as an academic. There is no reason for him to have any specialized antecedent understanding of the issue. What OPR does not highlight, indeed it goes out of its way to minimize, is that this prompted Professor Yoo to seek specialized help of the highest conceivable quality-not only by ordering another lawyer to research the issue thoroughly, but also by vetting the memo's analysis with Michael Chertoff, the head of the Criminal Division, who was a former federal prosecutor (and future federal appellate judge).32 Whatever the degree of criminal-law expertise that he himself brought to the table—and however derisively OPR may now seek to characterize it—it is abundantly clear that Professor Yoo availed himself of the tools of a lawyer's craft to produce an analysis that was, and remains, impeccably correct. There is in fact a good reason that Professor Yoo's final memorandum did not note the "uncertainty or ambiguity" in the meaning of "specific intent": There was none. In June 2000, shortly before Professor Yoo sat down to write the Bybee Memo, the United States Supreme Court had issued Carter, which concluded that one subsection of the bank-robbery statute created a "general intent" crime while the other required a showing of "specific intent" to steal, and offered examples to "help to make the distinction between 'general' and 'specific' intent less esoteric." 530 U.S. at 268-70. In explaining the precise and straightforward distinctions between "general" and "specific" intent, the Court cited the LaFave treatise, id. at 268-69, the same authority that OPR now cites for the proposition that "specific intent" has not been used consistently by the courts, see F.R. at 169. This supposed inconsistency did not trouble the Supreme Court, presumably because the LaFave treatise also states, and demonstrates through numerous examples, that specific intent actually has one most common meaning in American law. 1  Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 5.2(e) (2d ed. 2003) (*the most common usage of 'specific intent' is to designate a special mental element which is required above and beyond any mental state required with respect to the actus reus of the crime[s]").

  Unlike the Bybee Memo, the Draft Report did not even cite the Supreme Court's decision in Carter, let alone discuss it. And the Final Report mentions Carter only in passing, making no effort to explain how Professor Yoo's reliance on the most recent Supreme Court opinion on specific intent could remotely suggest that Professor Yoo's analysis was not thorough, much less incompetent. OPR evidently believes that Professor Yoo should have emphasized for the client that older Supreme Court cases had found the concept of specific intent difficult or elusive, though the more recent (and binding) decision. in Carter had not. As a basis for professional discipline, this analysis borders on the frivolous. It may be that OPR attorneys do not believe in the ameliorative influence of the Supreme Court's opinions on the uncertainties and difficulties that attend most areas of law, but the rest of the legal profession (including judges and disciplinary boards) is generally required to work on the assumption that more recent, definitive rulings from that Court reflect a mature consideration and resolution of earlier-expressed uncertainties. Second, OPR concludes that "OLC's advice erroneously suggested that an interrogator who inflicted severe physical or mental pain or suffering on an individual would not violate the torture statute if he acted with the goal or purpose of obtaining information." F.R. at 160-61. But OPR is unable to point to any statement in the Bybee Memo that says or even implies this, instead relying on the following sentence: "'Thus, even if the defendant knows that severe pain will result from his actions, if causing such harm is not his objective, he lacks the requisite specific intent even though the defendant did not act in good faith." Id. at 167 (quoting Bybee Memo at 4). This criticism appears lifted from the Levin Memo. See F.R. at 168 (quoting Levin Memo at 17). Whatever Mr. Levin may have thought, every jot and tittle of the statement quoted by OPR is an entirely accurate statement of the law. Indeed, it precisely echoes the holding of the en banc Third Circuit in Pierre: "We disagree that proof of knowledge ... that severe pain or suffering will be the practically certain result ... satisfies the specific intent requirement in the CAT. Rather, we are persuaded ... that the specific intent requirement, included in the ratification history of the CAT, requires a petitioner to show that his prospective torturer will have the motive or purpose to cause him pain or suffering." 528 F.3d at 189. Under OPR's view, the ten judges in the Third Circuit majority have now committed professional misconduct by creating the impression—at least to OPR and Mr. Levin that a torturer acting with the purpose of obtaining information is immune from prosecution. But this is an unfounded criticism. In fact, when the minority in Pierre expressed the same concern, id. at 196, the ten-judge majority had little difficulty in explaining why this criticism is wrong and unjustified. Id. at 190 n.7. Significantly, it was obvious to all thirteen judges that the issue they were debating had arisen in the context of the Bybee Memos; the minority noted that "Jay Bybee... set forth an interpretation of 'specific intent' that is similar to that espoused by the majority," id. at 193, and the three judges who disagreed with the majority's analysis issued an opinion that was largely a pages-long quotation of the Levin Memo. OPR cannot credibly assert, merely because it finds the minority's views more persuasive, that the analysis that rather decisively carried the day in Pierre is sanctionable.

  Moreover, a moment's thought would have revealed to OPR why Congress believed the specific-intent requirement so important for the torture statute and why Professor Yoo properly stated that knowledge alone is insufficient. In the absence of a specific-intent requirement, a general-intent statute criminalizing "torture" could, for example, reach a surgeon who performs open heart surgery in an Army base in Germany, or a physician who must amputate a leg in the field of battle in order to save a soldier's life. Both "know" to a certainty that their conduct will inflict "severe pain or suffering," but neither, of course, is guilty of "torture," because "causing such harm is not his objective." The surgeon, in other words, would save the man's life painlessly if he could. But nowhere does the Bybee Memo state or imply that a defendant's actual intent to cause severe pain is absolved by an ultimate motive to obtain information.33 And critically, OPR does not cite any evidence-because there is none-suggesting that the CIA believed it could lawfully "torture" a detainee so long as it was trying to elicit information. Third, OPR concludes that "[s]ome of the Bybee Memo's analysis was oversimplified to the point of being misleading," F.R. at 171, because it "suggested that, in order to violate the torture statute, a defendant would have to act with a 'purpose to disobey the law,'" F.R. at 173. OPR's criticism is premised on a gross distortion of the memo's two-sentence discussion of Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135 (1994). The Bybee Memo cited Ratzlaf as an "example" of the application of a specific-intent requirement. The memo explained that because the statute at issue in Ratzlaf required "'specific intent to commit the crime,'' the defendant in that case had to act with the express "purpose to disobey the law.' Bybee Memo at 3 (quoting Ratzlaf, 510 U.S. at 141). OPR evidently believes that because the specific intent required in Ratzlaf was a specific intent to violate the law—a form of specific intent that statutes typically signal with the term "willful"-Professor Yoo was suggesting that the same type of specific intent was required under the torture statute.

  No reasonable person could think that, given the Bybee Memo's very next sentence: "Here, because Section 2340 requires that a defendant act with the specific intent to inflict severe pain, the infliction of such pain must be the defendant's precise objective." Bybee Memo at 3. Nowhere does the Bybee Memo suggest that intent to violate the law is required under the torture statute, and no one reading the memo's Ratzlaf discussion could take that away from it. In fact, if the memo even remotely was intended to suggest that intent to violate the law was required, one would expect to see this purported requirement used or even alluded to in the Classified Bybee Memo which was issued on the same day for the purpose of analyzing the specific techniques proposed by the CIA under the standards outlined in the Bybee Memo. But nothing there, of course, supports OPR's strained reading.

  Fourth, OPR claims that the good-faith defense to a specific-intent crime "is generally limited to fraud or tax prosecutions." F.R. at 174. OPR cites no authority for this, relying only on a quotation trom a jury-instructions treatise that does not support the assertion. In fact, two paragraphs later OPR actually cites a case that stands for the opposite proposition: In United States v. Goings, 313 F.3d 423: (8th Cir. 2002), the court found in a theft case that "[t]he district court properly gave the Eighth Circuit stock instruction on good faith." Id. at 427 (emphasis added). OPR thus manages, for once, to successfully refute an argument. Fifth, OPR argues that "[t]he availability of good faith as a defense to torture is not a foregone conclusion" because a 1983 Fourth Circuit decision did not allow a defendant to invoke the good-faith defense when prosecuted under a statute criminalizing the export of firearms. F.R. at 174 (citing United States v. Wilson, 721 F.2d 967 (4th Cir. 1983)). OPR's argument here is misleading. In Wilson, like in Ratzlaf (but unlike here), the statute had a willfulness requirement-i.e., a requirement that the defendant act with the specific intent to violate the law. See 721 F.2d at 970 n.1, 971. The defendant argued that he had believed his actions were lawful because they had been authorized by government officials, and therefore that he did not have the requisite specific intent to violate the law. See 721 F.2d at 974-75 & n.10. The Fourth Circuit found "insufficient evidence to justify" an instruction on the good-faith defense, however, because "none of th[e] evidence show[ed] that Wilson was still working for the government, or impliedly authorized by government officials to export firearms illegally." Id. at 975 (emphasis added). In other words, the defendant's good-faith defense had a factual predicate—that government officials had authorized his actions-for which the defendant had put forward no evidence. That holding casts no doubt on the Bybee Memo's discussion of specific intent.

  Relatedly, OPR says that the Bybee Memo was deficient in "failing] to advise the client that under some circumstances, a prosecutor can challenge a good faith defense by alleging willful blindness." F.R. at 174. The en banc Third Circuit in Pierre, however, had no trouble concluding that "willful blindness" is not relevant to an analysis of specific intent to torture. 528 F.3d at 188, 190. "Willful blindness," the Court explained, "can be used to establish knowledge but it does not satisfy the specific intent requirement in the CAT." Id. at 190. The Second Circuit reached the same conclusion in its own Pierre decision (involving a different petitioner with the same surname), explaining that it could "not see how" either "willful blindness" or "deliberate indifference," "which may bear on knowledge to the extent they establish conscious avoidance, can without more demonstrate specific intent, which requires that the actor intend the actual consequences of his conduct." 502 F.3d at 118. Willful blindness can be sufficient for knowledge (and thus general intent), but not specific intent.

  OPR attempts to counter Pierre's willful-blindness holding by arguing that its Draft Report "did not assert that the government could establish a defendant's specific intent through a willful blindness theory," but rather that "a willful blindness instruction might be granted under some circumstances to counter a defendant's claim that he held a good faith belief—based on knowledge obtained from the CIA-that the use of EIT's would not result in the infliction of severe mental or physical pain or suffering." F.R. at 175. In other words, OPR conceives of a hypothetical defendant who might be deemed to "know" (based on willful blindness) that a particular interrogation would result in the infliction of pain and suffering, despite what the CIA might have told him. Apart from being contrived and arcane, this feat of contortionism still misses the point: As Pierre holds, "knowledge" or awareness of the "result," even if it "could" be severe pain, does not meet the statutory standard, which requires the purposeful infliction of such pain. And, as in its Draft Report, OPR continues to rely solely on older cases that did not involve torture for its contentions that "the availability of good faith as a defense is not a foregone conclusion" and that "a prosecutor can challenge" an intent defense based on willful blindness "under some circumstances," and to criticize the Bybee Memo's failure to discuss "the possibility that a court might refuse to extend the good faith defense to a crime of violence such as torture" as rendering the analysis "incomplete." F.R. at 173-74 (emphases added). Of course, the Bybee Memo did caution that "as a matter of practice in the federal criminal justice system" a defendant who acted "unreasonably]" but in good faith was "unlikely" to be acquitted. Bybee Memo at 5. OPR's contrivances notwithstanding, the Bybee Memo is simply not subject to criticism in this regard. OPR dismisses as "cursory" the Bybee Memo's significant qualifying language, which made clear that a good-faith defense was unlikely to be successful if not reasonable. F.R. at 175. As OPR concedes, the memo "included qualifying language that made it clear that notwithstanding legal theory, as a practical matter a jury could infer specific intent from a defendant's actions." F.R. at 167. As a matter of fact, despite that the specific-intent discussion is only two pages long, the Bybee Memo notes in several places that much of the discussion is "theoretical," and that juries might well find specific intent notwithstanding the theory. See, e.g., Bybee Memo at 4 ("While as a theoretical matter such knowledge [that severe pain or suffering will result] does not constitute specific intent, juries are permitted to infer from the factual circumstances that such intent is present. Therefore, when a defendant knows that his actions will produce the prohibited result, a jury will in all likelihood conclude that the defendant acted with specific intent.") (internal citations omitted); id. at 5 (noting that "as a matter of practice in the federal criminal justice system" a defendant who acted "unreasonably]" but in good faith is "unlikely" to be acquitted.). It cannot be credibly said that these repeated qualifications are only cursory, nor can Professor Yoo and Judge Bybee be condemned for accurately describing the law while conveying real-world limitations on the legal doctrine. A fair reading of these two pages reveals that OPR's assertion is baseless.

  No doubt recognizing the highly qualified (and manifestly correct) specific-intent analysis provided in the Bybee Memo, OPR is forced to point to other sources to support its theory that the advice was insufficient. OPR states, for example, that "OLC's advice to the CIA on specific intent and good faith was not limited to the Bybee Memo. In the Yoo Letter, the Classified Bybee Memo, and the CIA Bullet Points, OLC presented an unqualified, oversimplified view of the law without acknowledging potential problems.' F.R. at 175-76; see also F.R. at 227 ("Yoo provided the CIA with an unqualified, permissive statement regarding specific intent in his July 13, 2002 letter"). But OPR's reliance on these documents merely demonstrates the lengths it is willing to go to present its entirely one-sided view. The Yoo Letter and the Classified Bybee Memo were delivered to the client along with the Bybee Memo on August 1, 2002, and were clearly meant to be read in conjunction with it. It is unreasonable to suggest that each of the documents should have re-plowed all of the ground covered in the Bybee Memo, much less that the failure to do so amounts to sanctionable conduct. The so-called Bullet Points, a CIA document providing an overview of OLC's analysis, would not be expected to provide the same detailed analysis as the Bybee Memo, and OPR does not allege that the specific-intent summary, see F.R. at 103, 165, incorrectly states the law.35 The July 13, 2002 letter, moreover, was clearly tentative, summary advice superseded by the more detailed analysis provided in the Bybee Memo. See F.R. at 162 & n.126 (noting the closing statement of the July 13, 2002 letter, "[a]s you know, our office is in the course of finalizing a more detailed memorandum opinion analyzing section 2340,'" and stating that "[w]hen the Bybee Memo was issued a few weeks later, it included a more extensive discussion of the specific intent element.").

  Sixth and finally, OPR cites the Levin Memo approvingly for the proposition that it would not be "useful to try to define the precise meaning of 'specific intent'" in the torture statute, because "it would not be appropriate to rely on parsing the specific intent element of the statute to approve as lawful conduct that might otherwise amount to torture." F.R. at 169. OPR appears to be suggesting that Professor Yoo should have omitted the clearly correct legal analysis of specific intent and instead ducked the issue altogether-declining to interpret one of the elements of the criminal statute that he was tasked with analyzing. But this is wrong under elementary principles of criminal law. A person does not violate a criminal statute unless his conduct meets each of the elements; and no competent lawyer could offer advice on whether conduct violates a criminal proscription without examining each element of the relevant statute. In other words, a complete and competent analysis could not conclude that "conduct that might otherwise amount to torture" actually is torture under this statute without first defining specific intent. OPR's inability to understand this simple point is inexplicable.

  B. Severe Pain.
  One of the most challenging tasks that the authors of the Bybee Memo faced was to give concrete meaning to the torture statute's ambiguous term "severe. pain" so that it could be applied to real-world interrogations of terrorists with information about future attacks. They first looked to dictionaries, which said that pain or suffering is "severe" if it is "of such a high level of intensity that the pain is difficult for the subject to endure." Bybee Memo at 5. As any competent lawyer would do, the authors then examined other statutes that used the term "severe pain" to determine whether Congress's use of the word "severe" in those statutes "shed more light on its meaning" in §2340(1). Id. Their research disclosed that Congress used the term "severe pain" in six different provisions (relating to health benefits) when defining an emergency medical condition. Under those statutes, an emergency medical condition is one:manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in(i) placing the health of the individual... in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww-22(d)(3)(B) (2003). The Bybee Memo expressly acknowledged that "these statutes address a substantially different subject from Section 2340," but, after citing West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83 (1991), found them "nonetheless helpful for understanding what constitutes severe physical pain." Bybee Memo at 6. The memo concluded that these health benefits statutes "suggest" that for pain to be sufficiently "severe" under Section 2340 such pain must rise to a "similarly high level-the level that would ordinarily be associated with a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury such as death, organ failure, or serious impairment of body functions." Id. at 6 (emphases added). OLC deemed those statutes relevant because they confirmed the ordinary meaning of the statutory language: "[T]his view of the criminal act of torture is consistent with the term's common meaning. Torture is generally understood to involve "intense pain' or 'excruciating pain,' or put another way, 'extreme anguish of body or mind."" Id. at 13 (quoting dictionaries).

  The Draft Report gave the Bybee Memo's consideration of the medical-benefits statutes top billing in OPR's catalogue of supposed analytical failings, emphatically asserting that citation to those statutes clearly was unconventional legal analysis amounting to professional misconduct. By OPR's lights, a lawyer could reasonably cite. other statutes in construing statutory language if those statutes were sufficiently related in subject matter as to be considered "in pari materia," but it was obvious incompetence for any trained lawyer to consider unrelated statutes in advising a client. And this should have been obvious to Professor Yoo, the Draft Report asserted, because Casey "was premised upon the in pari materia doctrine." D.R. 139. "We know of no authority," OPR said, "in support of the proposition that identical words or phrases in two unrelated statutes are relevant in interpreting an ambiguous term." D.R. at 138. Indeed, Professor Yoo easily could have discovered this obvious interpretive no-no, OPR sarcastically noted, because the Sutherland treatise on statutory interpretation "was available in the main DOJ library when the Bybee Memo was written." D.R. at 137-38 & n.121. We responded to the Draft Report by listing numerous cases—including Casey in which the Supreme Court of the United States has cited unrelated statutes in statutory interpretation.36 We also noted that this commonplace technique —for which OPR could find "no authority" after four years of research—is also discussed in the Sutherland treatise itself, which to devotes an entire chapter to "interpretation by reference to statutes on other subjects," with a section entitled "interpretive relevance of unrelated statutes." See 2B NORMAN J. SINGER, SUTHERLAND ON STATUTES & STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION ch. 53 (6th ed. 2000) (emphasis added). It is worth noting, again, that OPR was prepared to issue its Draft Report as final in January 2009, after years of supposedly exhaustive investigation and drafting had resulted is astoundingly incompetent legal work. At this point, even Emily Litella would have had the sense to say "never mind," and call it a day.37 But not OPR. Without acknowledging its previous errors, OPR now says that examining the language of unrelated statutes "is a recognized technique of statutory interpretation." F.R. at 182 (emphasis added). But OPR contends that for a lawyer to do so the statutes must be "similar in purpose or subject matter" or that there must "generally" be "a logical basis" for "courts [to] look to unrelated statutes for guidance." F.R. at 182-83. Here, OPR contends, the "medical benefits statutes were neither related, similar, nor analogous to the torture statute," and this, "coupled with the fact that they did not in fact define, explain or interpret the meaning of 'severe pain' led us to conclude that the Bybee Memo's reliance on those statutes was unreasonable." F.R. at 184. Unsurprisingly, however, OPR's newest set of fabricated rules of statutory interpretation once again fail to support the predetermined outcome to which OPR so relentlessly clings.

  The fundamental flaw in OPR's analysis lies in its failure (or unwillingness) to recognize why the Supreme Court so often consults unrelated statutes that contain language similar to the language under review. Unrelated statutes are relevant evidence of the ordinary meaning of the disputed language. See, e.g., Carcieri v. Salazar, 129 S. Ct. 1058, 1064 (2009) (usage in unrelated statutes confirmed the "ordinary meaning" of statutory language as set forth in dictionaries). As Sutherland explains, in a passage that OPR again declines to mention, one reason that looking to unrelated statutes is such a common technique of statutory interpretation-albeit one not as persuasive as looking to statutes in pari materia—is that the way Congress has used a particular phrase in the past, "even among statutes on different and dissimilar subjects," can reveal "common idioms and customary language usage." 2B SINGER § 53:01. Because of that, "[t]he difference between statutes which are closely enough related to be regarded as in pari materia and those which are not is ... only one of degree." Id. § 53:02. Moreover, as Casey noted in the passage that was cited in the Bybee Memo, the Supreme Court construes new statutory language "to contain that permissible meaning which fits most logically and. comfortably into the body of both previously and subsequently enacted law," because "it is our role to make sense rather than nonsense out of the corpus juris." 499 U.S. at 100-01. That is, the entire "body of the law" (the corpus juris) provides a fundamental backdrop for consistent interpretation of like statutory terms, at least when the text of the new statute does not itself affirmatively "prevent] such accommodation." Id. at 101; see, e.g., Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 448 n.3 (2006) (court's "natural reading" was "confirmed" by the use of the same word "elsewhere in the United States Code" - not just those parts of the Code that were "similar" or had a supposed "logical connection" with the subject matter). OPR does not contend that the torture statute by its terms foreclosed reliance on the medical-benefits statutes; nor could it, given that those statutes were cited solely because they appeared to confirm the ordinary meaning suggested by dictionary definitions and even OPR does not contend that a lawyer commits misconduct by consulting standard English dictionaries.

  OPR does not address the reasoning of these cases, but it simply announces that unrelated statutes may not be consulted at all unless there is a "logical basis" for doing so. OPR does not explain what exactly are the contours of this requirement (much less whence it comes), but the examples it cites make clear that this "test" is either trivial (in the sense that every unrelated statute meets it) or meaningless, or both. For example, OPR first says that it makes some difference that the word or phrase in the unrelated statute "has been interpreted by the courts." F.R. at 183. This point appears designed solely to distinguish Carcieri v. Salazar, supra, which interpreted the word "now" in the Indian Reorganization Act in part by looking to how the Court had previously interpreted the word in a federal criminal statute and a citizenship statute. 129 S. Ct. at 1064. Of course, when Congress uses a phrase that has previously acquired a well-settled meaning in judicial rulings courts will presume that the same meaning is intended in the new statute. But that is not remotely what happened in Carcieri, where the Court made clear that one of the interpretations on which it relied post-dated the Indian Reorganization Act. Id. What was at issue instead was the policy identified by the Supreme Court in Casey-viz., construing like terms similarly in order to "make sense rather than nonsense" out of the entire United States Code. (Indeed, Casey expressly noted that, absent this policy, it would not make sense to consult "both previously and subsequently enacted law," because "how could an earlier Congress know what a later Congress would enact?" 499 U.S. at 100-01).

  In any event, OPR does not explain why it should make any difference that the particular unrelated statute has received a judicial construction; if, by OPR's lights, the underlying statute lacks a "logical connection" to the statute being construed, then presumably any judicial interpretation of that unrelated statute would be just as logically unconnected to the problem at hand.

  OPR distinguishes Buckeye Check Cashing, supra, by claiming there was "some logical basis" for referring "to language in completely dissimilar statutes" throughout the United States Code in that the term at issue was used elsewhere consistently with the meaning that the Court had already derived by consulting other sources, and "the Court did not rely solely upon similar language in dissimilar statutes." F.R. at 183-84 & n. 138 (emphasis added). If this distinction is not wholly question-begging (i.e., there is a "logical" connection only if OPR subjectively believes the citation supports the point at issue), the same could be said about the Bybee Memo, which used the medical-benefits statutes in conjunction with dictionary sources. Finally, OPR's distinction of Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U.S. 607 (1992), not only is unhelpful to OPR's case but also shows its "logical connection" test to be utterly trivial. According to OPR, the "logical basis" for the Court's use of unrelated statutes in DOE was that the unrelated statutes showed "usage of [the] term in other contexts." F.R. at 183. But of course any inclusion of a term in another statute gives context to the term. That was the reason that the Bybee Memo looked to the use of "severe pain" in the medical-benefits statute—to infer from its context the level of pain that the ordinary meaning of the term connoted. 38 OPR's "logical basis" requirement is thus a meaningless distinction drawn to salvage a fatally flawed argument, akin to the last-minute scribbling on a law-school bluebook when the student realizes that the entire premise of his answer is mistaken.

  OPR's remaining criticisms are similarly misdirected, and none provides a basis for professional discipline. OPR contends that the Bybee Memo paraphrased the language of the medical-benefits statutes in a way that heightened the standard for severe pain. According to OPR, for instance, the Memo equated the medical-benefits statutes' phrase "serious jeopardy" with the word "death." F.R. at 178. It did not. What the Memo said was that the statutes treat "severe pain as an indicator of ailments that are likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage .... Such damage must rise to the level of death, organ failure, or the permanent impairment of a significant bodily function." Bybee Memo at 6 (emphases added). The import of these sentences is that the pain must be such that accompanies conditions likely to result in death or other serious conditions-in other words, pain that accompanies conditions that put a person's health in "serious jeopardy." OPR's other claims of a "heightened standard" rely on an absurdly narrow parsing of the medical-benefits statutes' language. OPR believes that "serious dysfunction of any bodily organ," for example, may not be paraphrased as "organ failure," and that "serious impairment to bodily functions" may not be paraphrased as "permanent damage." F.R. at 178. OPR gives no explanation for why it thinks these phrases are not equivalent, and many reasonable English speakers would surely think that they are. It is curious that OPR finds it acceptable to paraphrase D.C. Rule 2.I's "honest assessment" requirement as a duty of "thoroughness, objectivity, and candor," but considers it sanctionable for the Bybee Memo to have paraphrased "serious dysfunction of a bodily organ" as "organ failure." OPR also contends that the Bybee Memo's analysis was "illogical" because "the intensity of pain that accompanies organ failure or death has no commonly understood meaning." F.R. at 178. But this is a most debatable proposition. The medical-benefits statutes themselves, after all, call for a judgment about whether a "prudent lay person" would think a level of pain is sufficiently severe as to indicate a serious jeopardy to health or bodily functions. And it is certainly not unheard-of to describe the severity of the pain that is required under the torture statute as "agony," even though "agony" can literally precede, and often does precede, death. For example, in interpreting the definition of "torture" in the Torture Victim Protection Act, the D.C. Circuit explained with respect to the meaning of "severe" that "(t]he more intense, lasting, or heinous the agony, the more likely it is to be torture." Price, 294 F.3d at 93; see also id. at 95 ("excruciating and agonizing"); id. at 92 ("The severity requirement is crucial to ensuring that the conduct proscribed... is sufficiently extreme and outrageous to warrant the universal condemnation that the term 'torture' both connotes and invokes"). The court provided no more detailed explanation than that. Just as with the Bybee Memo's description of "severe pain," there is no "readily identifiable level of pain" associated with "agony" that is "intense, lasting, or heinous." But surely OPR would not contend that Judges Edwards, Silberman and Sentelle committed professional misconduct by describing the severity of the pain associated with torture in such terms." OPR's related contention that there are some forms of death or organ failure "not associated with pain" is beside the point. The Bybee Memo's bottom line was that the pain must be "pain or suffering of the kind that is equivalent to the pain that would be associated with serious physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body function will likely result." Bybee Memo at 13 (emphases added). Anyone reading that in context would understand that the Memo is talking about pain from an "injury," i.e., a trauma of the sort that could be inflicted in an enhanced interrogation, not dying in your sleep.

  Perhaps most unfairly, OPR alleges that "[t]he Bybee Memo's definition could be interpreted as advising interrogators that they may legally inflict pain up to the point of organ failure, death, or serious physical injury." F.R. at 180. It could not. The Memo says that the pain must rise to the level that "would ordinarily be associated with a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury such as death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions." Bybee Memo at 6. There is no way to interpret this sentence other than that if the pain is equivalent to the pain that accompanies those conditions, the infliction qualifies as torture, whether or not it actually does result in those conditions. It certainly would not be so misinterpreted by the sophisticated legal audience at which the Bybee Memo was directed-especially given the analysis in the Classified Bybee Memo, which carefully examined the level of physical pain caused by the individual interrogation techniques even though none of those techniques cause death, organ failure, or serious impairment of bodily functions. See Classified Bybee Memo at 9-10 ("With respect to physical pain, we previously concluded that 'severe pain' within the meaning of Section 2340 is pain that is difficult for the individual to endure and is of an intensity akin to the pain accompanying serious physical injury.").Finally, OPR appears to suggest that the phrase "severe pain" is not ambiguous, because "any difficulty in interpreting the term 'severe pain' is more properly attributable to the subjective nature of physical pain, rather than ambiguous language." F.R. at 181 n.135 (quoting Levin Memo at 8 n.18). But pure linguistic ambiguity—i.e., ambiguity arising out of multiple dictionary definitions of the same worddoes not exhaust the realm of statutory ambiguity. The classic cases of ambiguous phrases in the administrative-law context have no linguistic ambiguity at all-think, for example, of "just and reasonable" in the rate-setting statutes-but rather ambiguity arising out of the "subjective nature" of the assessment called for by the term. And the Supreme Court would no doubt be surprised to learn that the terms "due process" or "cruel and unusual" are entirely free from ambiguity, or that the phrase "serious potential risk of physical injury to another" in the Armed Career Criminal Act is clear just because its dictionary definition is undisputed, compare, e.g., James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 209-12 (2007), with id. at 227-28 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Moreover, it would be passing strange, to say the least, for OPR to maintain that the phrase "severe pain" is somehow used in a completely different way in the medical-benefits statutes but that the phrase itself is not ambiguous—and thus necessarily to be given the same interpretation in all contexts in which it appears.

  C. US Judicial Interpretations.
  OPR concedes that there were no reported criminal prosecutions under the torture statute for the Bybee Memo to discuss, but faults the memo's treatment of related decisions under (1) immigration regulations implementing CAT Article 3, and (2) the Torture Victim Protection Act. OPR's basic complaint here is that Professor Yoo "ignored" the immigration decisions, which were a "relevant body of case law," and that Professor Yoo's "discussion of the TVPA cases focused on the more brutal examples." F.R. at 186. Since the Bybee Memo did in fact discuss the "body of case law" dealing with torture in the immigration context, and the since leading cases before and after the Bybee Memo was issued have affirmed that torture encompasses only "extreme and outrageous acts," Price, 294 F.3d at 92, OPR's assertions illustrate nothing so much as the contortions that OPR is willing to undertake to sustain its relentless smear. First, after grandly asserting that Professor Yoo "ignored a relevant body of case law that has applied the CAT definition of torture in the context of removal proceedings against aliens," F.R. at 186, OPR quickly must concede that immigration cases were discussed in the Appendix to the Bybee Memo (making it difficult to understand how anyone could claim that they were "ignored"). But OPR still finds fault with the fact that the underlying immigration regulations were not cited or discussed, and suggests that it was somehow improper to fail to cite two additional Ninth Circuit cases that "provid[ed] additional examples of how courts have distinguished between torture and less severe conduct." F.R. at 187 (citing Al-Saher v. INS, 268 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2001), Cornejo-Barreto v. Seifert, 218 F.3d 1004, 1016 (9th Cir. 2000), and Khanuja v. IN.S., 11 Fed. App'x 824 (9th Cir. 2001)) (emphasis added).

  It should be apparent to any impartial observer that an attorney's failure to apprise his client of "additional examples" of any legal proposition is a rather novel theory of professional irresponsibility. After all, as OPR is ultimately forced to concede, F.R. at 187 n.140, the Bybee Memo did discuss cases interpreting the relevant regulations. For example, Al-Saher, one of the cases OPR identifies in support of its argument, is included in the Appendix with a description of the conduct that the court found to be torture. The decision quoted 8 C.F.R. 208.18 and found that the conduct at issue met the regulatory definition. The Bybee Memo cited the case with the parenthetical that it was a "deportation case," clearly marking it as involving immigration. This is far more extensive treatment than OPR itself provides for that case in its Final Report, which cites the case without noting, stating, or discussing anything whatsoever about it beyond the fact that it involved an (undescribed) torture claim. The Appendix to the Bybee Memo also summarized a second case interpreting 8 C.F.R. 208, Bi Zhu Lin v. Ashcroft, 183 F. Supp. 2d 551 (D. Conn. 2002). Nor does OPR explain why it believes that the Bybee Memo should have undertaken a completely tangential and immaterial discussion of the immigration regulations themselves as opposed to the case-law under them—it does not identify a single solitary aspect of the immigration regulations that it believes merited particular mention or discussion. OPR's theory is unexplained and inexplicable. OPR likewise does not discuss the particulars of either Cornejo-Barreto or Khanuja, which it believes should have been cited as "additional examples." Both are inapposite. Cornejo-Barreto considered whether judicial review could extend, via habeas, to decisions by the Secretary of State to extradite fugitives who claim they will be tortured in the foreign country. The Court held that it could so exercise judicial review. It did not interpret the substantive meaning of the regulation, federal laws defining torture, or the Convention Against Torture. It found only that a fugitive could raise in habeas a claim that torture would occur-but it explicitly declared that it would not reach the merits of the petitioner's claim. Id. at 1017. Khanuja, an unpublished and non-precedential decision, denied a petition for asylum on the ground of religious persecution, not torture, and explained only that religious persecution would not state a claim, by itself, to prevent removal on the grounds of possible torture. For good measure, as Deputy Attorney General Filip informed OPR, a citation to Khanuja, an unpublished decision, would have been sanctionable under the rules of the Ninth Circuit. R. at 187 n.141; Mukasey Letter at 6 & n.4 (citing cases in which the Ninth Circuit issued orders to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for citing unpublished decisions). This does not detain OPR, which believes that although citing that case would be grounds for discipline in the court that issued it (i.e., the court one would think most likely to find its intrinsic reasoning impressive), nothing expressly "forbids" citing the case "in executive branch legal memoranda or reports." F.R. at 187 n.141.

  The best that could be said for this extraordinarily strained argument is that it might conceivably persuade a singularly inattentive reader of the notion that citing Khanuja is only arguably sanctionable, not indubitably so. It does not remotely show that Professor Yoo departed from professional norms by failing to cite this irrelevant unpublished case in the Bybee Memo. In the end, even OPR understands that its arguments about the immigration cases not only are picayune to the point of absurdity but also cannot overcome the fact that the Bybee Memo correctly assessed the relevance of those cases to the inquiry at hand. This is in stark contrast to OPR's own Draft Report, which wholly ignored Pierre and Auguste in its discussion of intent where they were incontestably relevant. As OPR puts it: The Bybee Memo's failure to discuss the CAT regulations was a relatively minor omission, and we note that the case law and CAT regulations are generally consistent with the Bybee Memo's uncontroversial conclusion that torture is an aggravated from of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. We note the omission here because of our determination that OLC's interpretation of the torture statute in the context of the CIA interrogation program demanded the highest level of thoroughness, objectivity, and candor. Id. at 187 (emphasis added). This paragraph highlights OPR's consistent approach: making pedantic and strained criticisms that do not call into question the analysis or ultimate conclusions of the memo, but that supposedly are relevant to OPR's "just for this case" heightened standard of professional responsibility. Second, OPR also criticizes the Bybee Memo's treatment of decisions under the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), concluding that the discussion "focused on the more brutal examples of conduct courts have found to be torture, and downplayed less severe examples in the reported decisions." F.R. at 186. OPR is particularly critical of the fact that that the Bybee Memo included an extended discussion of Mehinovic v. Vuckovic, 198 F. Supp. 2d 1322 (N.D. Ga. 2002), because it believes that two other cases— Daliberti v. Republic of Iraq, 146 F. Supp. 2d 19 (D.D.C. 2001), and Simpson v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 180 F. Supp. 2d 78 (D.D.C. 2001)-stand for the proposition that acts "less extreme" than the court confronted in Mehinovic could also amount to torture. F.R. at 188-89. OPR also complains that the Bybee Memo was wrong to say that a single blow and its attendant pain, considered in isolation, could not amount to torture, and that if Mehinovic were read to stand for that proposition it would be wrong. This is yet another instance of OPR faulting Professor Yoo for giving clearly correct legal advice.

  The Bybee Memo made clear that Mehinovic was cited because, while most cases provide "limited analysis" of the torture question, Mehinovic was a "recent" case that "provide[d] some assistance in predicting how future courts might address this issue." Bybee Memo at 24. Nothing about providing "some assistance" in "predicting" how courts "might" rule in future cases would suggest to a reasonable reader that the case was being proffered as exemplifying the minimum quantum of abuse required to meet the statutory definition of torture. Indeed, the immediately preceding paragraph summarized the extreme types of abusive conduct that had been the subject of judicial rulings but expressly cautioned that "we cannot say with certainty that acts falling short of these. would not constitute torture under Section 2340 ...." Id. (emphasis in original). And the memo's discussion of the case concluded by emphasizing "that Mehinovic presents, with the exception of the single blow to [one of the victims], facts that are well over the line of what constitutes torture" Id. at 27." The case was nonetheless useful, the Bybee Memo concluded, in illustrating that TVPA cases "generally ... are in keeping with the general notion that the term 'torture' is reserved for acts of the most extreme nature." Moreover, both Daliberti and Simpson were cited and summarized in the Appendix to the Bybee Memo as relevant authorities, so OPR's complaint—an ethical complaint, no less is—is that Professor Yoo cited and discussed all the TVPA authorities that OPR believes were relevant but his judgments about appropriate emphasis (and on which cases would be most informative for the client) does not accord with OPR's. Moreover, OPR's contention that both cases were obviously "less extreme" than Mehinovic is also rather subjective. In Daliberti, Iraqi guards attempted to execute one of the plaintiffs and threatened another with undeniable acts of torture, 146 F. Supp. 2d at 22-23, while Simpson also involved death threats and interrogation during prolonged incommunicado detention, 180 F. Supp. 2d at 81. Indeed, even if the Bybee Memo were read as asserting that the conduct in Simpson was not torture, it would be correct: the district court's opinion was unanimously reversed by the D.C. Circuit after the issuance of the Bybee Memo upon a finding that the acts in question did not amount to torture. The D.C. Circuit explained that "[a]lthough these alleged acts certainly reflect a bent toward cruelty on the part of their perpetrators, they are not in themselves so unusually cruel or sufficiently extreme and outrageous as to constitute torture within the meaning of the Act." Simpson v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 326 F.3d 230, 234 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (per Sentelle, J., joined by Henderson and Tatel, JJ).

  OPR devotes almost an entire page of its Final Report to discussing the district court's decision in Simpson but notes only in the briefest of footnotes that the decision was reversed. F.R. at 189 & n.144. If the placement of authority in footnotes or appendices, as opposed to text, or the extensiveness of the discussion given to one versus the other were an ethical issue that calls for bar discipline, it is doubtful that the authors of the Final Report would ever again be permitted to leave the office of the bar's disciplinary counsel. But OPR's reasons that the D.C. Circuit opinion is simply not relevant to the analysis because it was "issued ... after the Bybee and Yoo Memos had been issued." Id. The country's leading ethics experts disagree with OPR on its rather counterintuitive position that decisions that clearly prove the Bybee Memo correct must be wholly disregarded in assessing the adequacy of the advice given merely because they were not yet available at the time the memo was written. See Rotunda Letter at 3; Hazard Letter at 3. In any event, the advice was clearly correct under the law as it existed even when the memo was written: The D.C. Circuit's decision in Simpson applied and quoted extensively from its earlier decision in Price, which preceded the Bybee Memo by a month. As Simpson noted, Price had already held that "[t]orture does not automatically result whenever individuals in official custody are subjected even to direct physical assault.'* Simpson, 326 F.3d at 234 (quoting Price, 294 F.3d at 93). The allegations that Price had held insufficient to state a claim for torture included the facts that the plaintiffs were "kicked, clubbed and beaten," "interrogated and subjected to physical, mental and verbal abuse," and "held in deplorable conditions while incarcerated, including urine-soaked mattresses, a cramped cell with substandard plumbing that they were forced to share with seven other inmates, a lack of medical care, and inadequate food." Price, 294 F.3d at 86. Price emphasized that there is an important distinction between "actual torture" and "mere police brutality," and concluded that the facts pleaded did not "reasonably support a finding that the physical abuse allegedly inflicted by Libya evinced the degree of cruelty necessary to reach a level of torture." Id. at 93, 94. Never once in its report does OPR mention the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Price. Not once. In sum, OPR goes to great lengths to manufacture criticisms that ignore the numerous caveats expressed by the Bybee Memo about how courts were likely to deal with claims of torture under the TVPA, and never comes anywhere close to impugning the Bybee Memo's basic conclusion that cases under the TVPA "are in keeping with the general notion that "torture" is reserved for acts of the most extreme nature." Bybee Memo at 27. That statement of the law was, and remains, wholly and unquestionably correct.

  D. International Decisions.
OPR objects to the Bybee Memo's discussion of two decisions from foreign tribunals: Ireland v. United Kingdom, a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, and Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v. Israel, a decision of the Israeli Supreme Court. F.R. at 190. Although OPR apparently reads this section as an incomplete effort to assess "international opinion" and comprehensively survey international law, id., the Bybee Memo makes clear at the outset that these decisions were being discussed simply to illustrate how other Western countries have understood the distinction between "torture" on the one hand and "cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment" on the other: "International decisions can prove of some value in assessing what conduct might rise to the level of severe mental pain or suffering. ... As this Part will discuss, other Western nations have generally used a high standard in determining whether interrogation techniques violate the international prohibition on torture." Bybee Memo at 27 (also noting that while international decisions "can prove of some value," they are "in no way binding authority upon the United States"). OPR does not argue that this conclusion is mistaken, nor does it explain why consultation of these opinions in this way violated professional norms. Perhaps more significantly, OPR condemns Judge Bybee and Professor Yoo for discussing these cases, but fails to grapple with its own factual finding that the limited discussion was included in response to a direct request by the CIA: "The CIA personnel at the meeting asked Yoo for guidance on the legality of their plan under the torture statute, the CAT, and European and Israeli case low." F.R. at 41 & n.45 (noting that "the reference was clearly to the two cases referenced above - Ireland v. United Kingdom and PCATI v. Israel) (emphasis added). OPR's indictment of Professor Yoo and Judge Bybee for including a discussion of these particular cases, when the ClA had made a specific request for their inclusion, is simply baffling. 

  OPR's quibbling critiques of the section are similarly misdirected. For example, OPR compiles a list of five "important facts" related to Ireland v. U.K. that the Bybee Memo "ignored" and that OPR contends would have been included in a "thorough, objective, and candid examination" of the case. F.R. at 191-92. But OPR's first three facts-that an investigating commission found the techniques to be torture and the U.K. did not contest the finding, that an internal U.K. review found the techniques to be prohibited by domestic law, and that the U.K. renounced further use of the techniques— are utterly irrelevant to the court's determination that the methods did not constitute torture within the meaning of the law. And the fourth and fifth items on OPR's list, which fault the Bybee Memo for not describing the dissenting opinions in the European Court of Human Rights and for not stating that the majority held that Great Britain's interrogation methods violated the European Convention on Human Rights, are similarly without merit. Whether to mention a dissent or not is a matter of judgment; American lawyers and judicial opinions regularly discuss precedent without delving into the dissents. And OPR's claim that the Bybee Memo did not disclose that the European Court had found Great Britain's methods to violate the European Convention is simply mistaken. The Bybee Memo says that the European Convention prohibits both torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, Bybee Memo at 27-28, and it states clearly that the "European Court of Human Rights concluded that these techniques used in combination, and applied for hours at a time, were inhuman and degrading but did not amount to torture." Id. at 29.

  OPR additionally faults the Bybee Memo for not including a discussion of every subsequent European Court case considering Ireland v. U.K. But OPR does not contest the Bybee Memo's conclusion that Ireland is the "leading" European Court of Human Rights Case, see Bybee Memo at 28, and OPR admits (albeit in a footnote) that "[m]uch of that case law in fact supports the uncontroversial conclusion that the term 'torture' should be applied to more severe forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment." F.R. at 192 & n.147 (emphasis added). Although OPR suggests that a subsequent case "raised questions about the continuing validity" of Ireland, F.R. at 193 (citing Selmouni v. France), a review of that case reveals that it repeatedly cites the Ireland case favorably. That it included some general language (not tied to Ireland) about the European Convention being a "living document" that might be interpreted differently over time does nothing to undermine the Bybee Memo's discussion of Ireland. In any event, failure to discuss such vague dicta does not even remotely suggest professional misconduct. OPR's criticisms are inexplicably trifling. OPR's treatment of the Israeli case is similarly tendentious. OPR takes issue with the Bybee Memo's statement that the Israeli case is best read as finding that the five Israeli interrogation techniques challenged therein did not amount to torture, calling this conclusion "misleading." F.R. at 194. But the Bybee Memo concedes that "[t]o be sure, such a conclusion [regarding whether the techniques at issue amounted only to torture] was unnecessary [to the court's decision] because even if the acts only amounted to cruel and inhuman treatment the GSS lacked authority to use the five methods." Bybee Memo at 30. Rather, the memo relied, inter alia, on the fact that "the court carefully avoided describing any of these acts as having the severity of pain or suffering indicative of torture" in reaching its conclusion. Id. Indeed, OPR points to nothing in the Israeli opinion that describes any of the interrogation methods as rising to the level of torture, and the language used in the opinion in fact supports the Bybee Memo's conclusion. See, e.g., PCATI at 1| 25 (concluding that stress position technique is "degrading"); | 30 (favorably citing Ireland for the proposition that a "similar" combination of interrogation methods were "inhuman and degrading"). Of course, the case was also relevant in light of the Israeli Supreme Court's observation that otherwise impermissible interrogation methods can be justified by necessity in appropriate circumstances. In the end, while OPR's convoluted criticisms would be the envy of a professional contortionist, they add nothing of substance to OPR's claim that Professor Yoo violated ethical norms.<sup>[[37]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-yoofinal.pdf#page=41)</sup></sup> <sup>[[38]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-bybeefinal.pdf#page=52)</sup></sup> <sup>[[39]](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-margolis.pdf)</sup></sup>

  #### Military Interrogations/detention, Guantanamo Bay:

- After interrogations under FM 34-52 failed, Major General Michael Dunlavey requested a number of counter-resistant techniques not within FM 34-52.<sup>[[40]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090714112912/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=7487)</sup></sup> These were broken down into 3 categories. After extensive legal review, Cat 1 and 2 were approved. Only one Cat 3 was approved: Mild, non-injurious physical contact such as grabbing, poking in the chest with a finger, and light pushing. However, not even this was put into practice. Cat 2 approvals were rescinded before they could be used.<sup>[[41]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090724080341/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jun2004/d20040622doc3.pdf)</sup></sup> Upon further legal review by an independent panel, only techniques that closely followed FM 34-52 were approved. Waterboarding didn't make it through the panel's review early on.<sup>[[42]](https://ia802504.us.archive.org/27/items/IG-Church-detainee-report/ChurchReport_text.pdf#page=11)</sup></sup> Some will be tempted to regurgitate the old talking-point that many former detainees at GTMO were never charged by the US—this is correct, however, that doesn't imply they weren't connected to terrorism, or otherwise involved in hostilities. The vast majority of GTMO's entire population were sent back to countries they were citizens of, to face their Courts at home. Many have been charged, and convicted in US Courts and Military Commissions with several before the SCOTUS.<sup>[[43]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Guantanamo_Bay_Unclasssified_List_FINAL.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[44]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[45]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2010/06/02/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf#page=28)</sup></sup>

- An authoritative paper found that, "The mental health providers at GTMO provide care in accordance with both the APA and American Psychiatric Association ethical guidelines. The standards set forth by the Geneva Conventions for both medical and mental health care are exceeded by the medical personnel at GTMO."<sup>[[46]](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-01792-001)</sup></sup>

- In October 2006, Sgt Heather Cerveny alleged that while drinking, 4 Sailors admitted to detainee abuse at GTMO. This was refuted by consistent testimony of the 4 individuals, among others, and particular allegations she made of where these people claimed to have worked at the facility, etc. Some areas were not yet built, or their station no where near detainees. In sum, she knew she made a fictitious story.<sup>[[47]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/09-F-0049_BassettReport.pdf)</sup></sup>

- A 2005 meta-analysis found, "Intelligence operations at GTMO are conducted in a highly-structured, well-disciplined environment that is conducive to intelligence collection.... much of the credit for the structure and discipline at GTMO is due to specific policies and procedures that have developed at GTMO over time, or what we refer to in shorthand as the GTMO "model." And, "As noted above, the first 19 techniques in the current policy were virtually identical to the techniques found in FM 34-54. Of the remaining remaining techniques, dietary manipulation simply consisted of feeding detainees military field rations; sleep adjustment did not entail depriving detainees of sleep, but rather adjusting their sleep cycles from night to day; and false flag involved the sort of nonviolent trickery or ruse that is inherent in many FM 34-52 techniques." It adds, "recent media reports have fuelled controversy over detainee treatment at GTMO, as several detainees (or their lawyers). have made claims of violent physical abuse and torture. For example: Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal, Rhuhel Ahmed, Moazzam Begg, a former chauffer for Usama Bin Ladin, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib made widely-publicized claims of torture. Our review of medical records found no evidence to support allegations of torture or violent physical abuse of detainees. In fact, detainees were more likely to suffer injury from playing soccer or volleyball during recreational periods than they were from interactions with interrogators or guards. Almost without exception, therefore, detainees at GTMO have been treated humanely." Lastly, We think it bears emphasis that the military leadership at GTMO has been and is making vigorous efforts to investigate all allegations of detainee abuse, whether the allegations come from DoD personnel, contractors, the ICRC, or the detainees themselves. Detainees have numerous channels available to report allegations of abuse: they can report allegations to military police, interrogators, linguists, medical personnel and chaplains. They also have opportunities to bring any concerns to the attention of the ICRC, which is a regular presence at GTMO that advocates on the detainees' behalf. In our view, the extremely low rate of abuse [3 minor infractions] at GTMO is largely due to strong command oversight, effective leadership, and adequate training on detainee handling and treatment. Additionally, those aspects of the GTMO "model" already discussed above—namely, a command organization that placed detention and intelligence operations under the command of a single entity, JTF-GTMO; effective coordination between interrogators and military police; adequate detention and interrogation resources; and well-developed standard operating procedures—have clearly played a role in keeping detainee abuse to a minimum. All of the closed, substantiated abuse cases are relatively minor in nature, and none bears any resemblance to the abuses depicted in the Abu Ghraib photographs. Almost without exception, therefore, detainees at GTMO have been treated humanely."<sup>[[48]](https://archive.org/details/IG-Church-detainee-report/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  
- On June 9, 2005, an investigation into FBI allegations of detainee abuse concluded. After reviewing a _three-year_ period covering more than _24,000 interrogations_, Furlow and Schmidt identified _three_ interrogation acts that were never approved for use by the government. The investigation revealed no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at Guantanamo Bay. Interrogations were assessed, separately, to fall within bounds of US and International law, even those not approved, or were approved and never implemented.<sup>[[49]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/report/2005/d20050714report.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In early January of 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Order ordering the Secretary of Defense to "immediately undertake a review of the conditions of detention at Guantanamo to ensure full compliance with this directive." This report, submitted on 2/23/09, conforms with that order by setting out the conditions and conclusions: The Secretary of Defense tasked a special DoD team to review the conditions of confinement at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, to ensure all detainees there are being held “in conformity with all applicable laws governing the conditions of confinement, including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions,” pursuant to the President’s Executive Order on Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities, dated January 22, 2009. The Review Team conducted 13 days of investigation on site that included more than 100 interviews with JTF-Guantánamo leadership, support staff, interrogators, and guards, multiple announced and unannounced inspections of all camps during daylight and night operations, reviewed numerous reports, video, discipline records, and observed many aspects of daily operations. Collectively, we talked to a number of detainees and observed detainee activities, including enteral feedings and interrogations. The review Team also solicited a sampling of opinion, studies, and published works, which reflected the perspective of detainees and other concerned interest groups, many with recommendations to improve detention conditions. This included our request for additional views from four organizations who wrote to the President concerning Guantánamo on January 30, 2009: Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International. These organizations responded to that request on February 6, 2009, and their submissions were carefully considered. After considerable deliberation and a comprehensive review, it is our judgment that the conditions of confinement in Guantánamo are in conformity with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.<sup>[[50]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2918343/Review-of-Department-Compliance-With-Presidents.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
  It is worth noting as well that even the least compliant detainees at Guantanamo Bay are provided with two to eight hours a day of recreation, quarterly meetings with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), ICRC messages, mail, skype, and phone access, Halal meals with several menu choices, prayer beads, prayer rugs, and other religious accommodations, as well as a library, 178 satellite TV stations, 79 satellite radio stations, classes, movies, and video games.<sup>[[51]](https://www.lawfareblog.com/federal-prosecution-viable-option-enemy-combatants)</sup></sup> Where hunger strike was concerned, the SOP was the following:

  A JMG medical provider will counsel the detainee who is on hunger strike as to the medical hazards of a prolonged period without food and/or water. The medical staff shall explain the medical risks faced by the detainee and make a reasonable effort to convince the detainee to resume eating food and drinking water.<sup>[[52]](https://www.aele.org/law/gitmo-force-feed.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- GTMO handling of the Koran. To respect the cultural and respect to Islam, GTMO issued SOPs that mitigated the likelihood of guards ever touching the Koran. "To ensure the safety of the detainees and guards while respecting the cultural dignity of the Korans thereby reducing the friction over the searching the Korans. JTF-GTMO personnel directly working with detainees will avoid handling or touching the detainee’s Koran whenever possible. When military necessity does require the Koran to be searched, the subsequent procedures will be followed: (1) The guard informs the detainee that the Chaplain or a Muslim interpreter will inspect Koran. If the detainee refuses the inspection at any time, the noncompliance is reported to the DOC and logged appropriately by the Block NCO. (2) The Koran will not be touched or handled by the guard. (3) The Chaplain or Muslim interpreter will give instructions to the detainee who will handle the Koran. He may or may not require a language specific interpreter. (4) The inspector is examining to notice unauthorized items, markings, or any indicators that raises suspicion about the contents of the Koran. (5) The inspector will instruct the detainee to first open the one cover with one hand while holding the Koran in the other thus exposing the inside cover completely. (6) The inspector instructs the detainee to open pages in an upright manner (as if reading the Koran). This is a random page search and not every page is to be turned. Pages will be turned slowly enough to clearly see the pages. (7) The inspector has the detainee show the inside of the back cover of the Koran. (8) The detainee is instructed to show both ends of the Koran while the book is closed so that inspector can note the binding while closed paying attention to abnormal contours or protrusions associated with the binding. The intent is to deduce if anything may be in the binding without forcing the detainee to expose the binding, which may be construed as culturally insensitive or offensive given the significance of the Koran. (9) How the detainee reacted, observation by other detainees, and other potentially relevant observations will be annotated in DIMS. 
  
  Handling. (1) Clean gloves will be put on in full view of the detainees prior to handling. (2) Two hands will be used at all times when handling the Koran in manner signaling respect and reverence. Care should be used so that the right hand is the primary one used to manipulateany part of the Koran due to the cultural association with the left hand. Handle the Koran as if it were a fragile piece of delicate art. (3) Ensure that the Koran is not placed in offensive areas such as the floor, near the toilet or sink, near the feet, or dirty/wet areas. Removal. (1) Korans must be transported by the detainee, in the event the detainee is moved to another cell or block. (2) If a Koran must be removed at the direction the CJDOG, the detainee library personnel, Muslim interpreter, or Chaplain will be contacted to retrieve and properly store the Koran in the detainee library. The request for the librarian, interpreter, or Chaplain, as well as the retrieval itself, will be logged in DIMS. (3) If the Chaplain, librarian, or Muslim interpreter, within the needs of the situation, cannot remove the Koran, then the guard may remove the Koran after approved by the DOC (who notes this in the DIMS) IAW the following procedures: (a) Clean gloves will be put on in full view of the detainees prior to handling. (b) Two hands will be used at all times when handling the Koran in manner signaling respect and reverence. (c) Place a clean, dry, detainee towel on the detainee bed and then place the Koran on top of the clean towel in a manner, which allows it to be wrapped without turning the Koran over at any time in a reverent manner. Ensure that the Koran is not placed in offensive areas such as the floor, near the toilet or sink, near the feet, or dirty/wet area when doing this activity. (4) How the detainee reacted, observation by other detainees, and other potentially relevant observations will be annotated appropriately in the DIMS significant activities menu. (5) The Koran shall be returned to the librarian, Chaplain, or DOC (in that order). (6) Korans are the property of the U.S. Government and as such will remain in the cells only to be removed at the CJDOG’s decision. (7) If a Koran is damaged or destroyed by a detainee, the chaplain in conjunction with a Muslim interpreter will take the Koran from the detainee for a minimum of ten days noted in DIMS. At that point, the chaplain can reissue the Koran to the detainee. The chaplain must ensure the block knows the Koran is being taken to protect the Koran, not punish the detainee.<sup>[[53]](https://web.archive.org/web/20080530003553/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603-b.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
- In 2005, allegations that guards at GTMO mishandled/disrespected the Koran (Quran) were independently investigated by Jay Hood. The inquiry reviewed over three years worth of records, totalling 31,000 documents, both electronic and hard copy, including: sixty-three Habeas petitions, thirty-eight press articles, etc. While only 4 of these were confirmed, there were 15 confirmed cases of detainees mishandling the Quran. Further, contrary to allegations, the inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Koran down a toilet. However, a detainee did flush another detainee's in the toilet.<sup>[[54]](https://web.archive.org/web/20050611060110/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603a.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[55]](https://web.archive.org/web/20080530003534/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603.pdf)</sup></sup>

#### Military Interrogations/detention, Abu Ghraib/Bagram:
- Unauthorised detainee abuse were already subject to independent investigations at Abu Ghraib and Bagram. It should be noted: That this was rare, done by a "small group of morally corrupt soldiers and civilians". Accountability was swift when thoroughly investigated. As noted in a comprehensive examination of detainee handling even as early as July 2004, there was no systemic abuse, or causes of abuse. The vast majority were in compliance with DoD standards for humane treatment and care. Some may be tempted to quote the Taguba report as evidence of "systemic abuse". However, this is folly. As used in the Taguba investigation, the term "systemic" deals with a subset of the security and interrogation operations at only one interment/resettlement facility and is not theater-wide. Further, MG Taguba testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on 11 May 04, narrowing the extent of the term “systemic” by stating that these particular abuses were individual actions not committed at the direction of the chain of command and that the resulting photos were taken with personal cameras. As an IG report independently finds, "Based on our review and analysis  of reports and case summaries of Investigations and our observations and interviews conducted throughout this inspection, we could not identify a systemic cause for the abuse incidents."<sup>[[58]](https://archive.org/details/detainee-operations-inspection)</sup></sup> <sup>[[59]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nationi/documents/fay_report_8-25-04.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
  As for the leadership of Abu Ghraib, during the brief period of the rare, unauthorised detainee abuse, two independent investigations were conducted in 2005: One by the Army IG, the other by the Army's JAG Office. They examined 5 senior officers: Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski, Maj. Gen. Barbara G. Fast, Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, and Col. Marc Warren. To this end, the DAIG examined previously completed investigations, while conducting its own, more thorough review—it examined allegations of dereliction in the performance of duties pertaining to detention and interrogation operations, and improperly communicating interrogation policies. The DAIG found all these allegations unfounded, aside from two in the case of Karpinski. Allegation of shoplifting and dereliction were found substantiated. Though Karpinski’s performance of duty was found to be lacking in niche areas, the investigation determined that no action or lack of action on her part contributed specifically to the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib. The probe also found the allegation she did not punish those under her command unfounded, and that she strived to do so, when allegations arose. President Bush approved the recommendation to demote Karpinski to Colonel, and honourably discharged from service. The JAG's PSI cleared Col. Marc Warren.<sup>[[60]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413065842/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[61]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413195544/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt2.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[62]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/fast_ig_report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[63]](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309165139/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Wojdakowski_IG_Report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[64]](https://archive.org/details/karpinski-daig)</sup></sup> <sup>[[65]](https://web.archive.org/web/20050510232110/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=7293)</sup></sup>

- On September 23, 2009, an independent investigation found that allegations that the DoD, between September 2001 to April 2008 was using "mind-altering drugs" on detainees to be unsubstantiated.

Immediately after the death—the CID and CIA conducted independent, and thorough investigations—CIA made a criminal referral to DOJ, who prosecuted David Passaro. Passaro was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months in prison and three years of supervised release. This was over double what federal sentencing guidelines usually recommend for assault charges. Passaro was also the first American charged under the U.S. Patriot Act, which extended the jurisdiction of U.S. federal courts to include certain violations of the law committed by military contractors overseas.<sup>[[70]](https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nce/press/2004/2004-Jun-17.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[71]](https://archive.org/details/passaro-oig)</sup></sup> <sup>[[72]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016180137/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-2006/pr08172006.htm)</sup></sup>

- On December 10, 2002, a number of US Military personnel (20) were involved in detainee abuse that resulted in the death of two men, one of whom was Dilawar. CIA had no involvement in this matter. All men were convicted.<sup>[[73]](https://archive.org/details/doddoacid-011770)</sup></sup>

- By mid-2004, 155 investigations into detainee abuse allegations had been completed, resulting in 66 substantiated cases. An independent panel concluded, "No approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuses that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."<sup>[[74]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/d20040824finalreport.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Lastly, the previously mentioned September 2005 Navy Inspector General, also known as the Church report conducted a meta-study of all previous reviews, investigations of GTMO, Abu Ghraib, and elsewhere—as well as its own fresh investigation: "we examined the 187 DoD investigations of alleged detainee abuse that had been closed as of September 30, 2004. Of these investigations, 71 (or 38%) had resulted in a finding of substantiated detainee abuse, including six cases involving detainee deaths. 8 of the 71 cases occurred at GTMO, all of which were relatively minor in their physical nature. Additionally, 130 cases remained open, with investigations ongoing. Finally, our investigation indicated that commanders are making vigorous efforts to investigate every allegation of abuse—regardless of whether the allegations are made by DoD personnel, civilian contractors, detainees, the ICRC, the local populace, or any other source." One case was removed from this statistical report leaving it to just 70 substantiated. Of the 70, there were only 121 victims. Disciplinary action was taken against a total of 115 personnel. The investigation found no link between approved interrogation techniques and detainee abuse." The report also finds, "An early focus of our investigation was to determine whether DoD had promulgated interrogation policies or guidance that directed, sanctioned or encouraged the abuse of detainees. We found that this was not the case. While no universally accepted definition of "torture" or "abuse" exists, the theme that runs throughout the Geneva Conventions, international law and US military doctrine is that detainees must be treated "humanely." Moreover, the President, in his February 7, 2002 memorandum that determined that al Qaeda and the Taliban are not entitled to EPW protections under the Geneva Convention, reiterated the standard of "humane" treatment. We found, without exception, that the DoD officials and senior military commanders responsible for the formulation of interrogation policy evidenced the intent to treat detainees humanely, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion that such officials or commanders ever  accepted that detainee abuse would be permissible. Even in the absence of precise definition of "humane" treatment, it is clear that none of the pictured abuse at Abu Ghraib bear any resemblance to approved policies at any level, in any theater. We note, therefore, that our conclusion is consistent with the Independent Panel, which in its August 2004 report determined that "no approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuse that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."<sup>[[75]](https://archive.org/details/IG-Church-detainee-report)</sup></sup>

- Claims that the United States invaded Afghanistan to control the poppy fields and protect the market have proven time and time again to be false, ignoring the US-led effort to destroy, disrupt and phase out poppy cultivation in the land, working with the Afghanistan Government and ISAF to reach this goal. This goal has had its ups and downs, and did work overall. While poppy production increased over the years; it stemmed from Taliban/AQ-controlled regions—not those controlled by the Government. Prior to the presense of US personnel in Afghanistan, 2001, poppy and other drugs skyrocketed under the Taliban regime.<sup>[[1]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/inl/rls/other/102214.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/90671.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/counternarcotics/index.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20171213_RL30588_0a51c51635f5c5fcd227fe6dc9d4dda135ef1aa4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://media.defense.gov/2007/Jul/01/2001712995/-1/-1/1/Counternarcotics_Pgr_Afghan%20_Final%20Rpt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/testimonies/witnesses/attachments/2016/02/02/01-15-14_dea_capra_testimony_re_future_us_counternarcotics_efforts_in_afghanistan_web_ready.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/drug-trade-flourish-under-taliban)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://archive.org/details/taliban-support-drugs)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/nie-may-2001-report )</sup></sup>

- After the terrorist attack on 9/11, the US responded by sending in small CIA/Special Forces teams into Afghanistan. They knew their enemy. "In CTC/SO, we operated on the understanding that the enemy was not Afghanistan, not the Afghan people, and not even the Taliban as a government institution. The enemy was al-Qaida, particularly the terrorists' command and control network and their specific Taliban leadership allies."<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf)</sup></sup>

- A 2003 international group of experts, by the IAEA, reviewed sites in Kuwait in which Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions were used in the First Gulf War. The report finds: "On the basis of the measurements carried out at the sites investigated in the IAEA’s study and summarized in this report, DU does not pose a radiological hazard to the population of Kuwait... Annual radiation doses that could arise from exposure to DU residues would be very low and of little radiological concern. Annual radiation doses in the areas where residues do exist would be of the order of a few microsieverts, well below the annual doses received by the population of Kuwait from the natural sources of radiation in the environment and far below the reference level recommended by the IAEA as a criterion to help establish whether remedial actions are necessary."<sup>[[1]](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1164_web.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On June 26, 1993, the United States launched a cruise missile attack against a building housing the IIS in Baghdad in retaliation for the assassination attempt on former President Bush. Former President George Bush visited Kuwait between April 14 and April 16, 1993, to commemorate the allied victory in the Persian Gulf War. In late-April 1993, the United States learned that terrorists had attempted to assassinate Bush during his visit to Kuwait. The Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 persons suspected in the plot to kill Bush using explosives hidden in a Toyota Landcruiser. The Kuwaitis recovered the Landcruiser, which contained between 80 and 90 kilograms of plastic explosives connected to a detonator (the Bush device or Bush explosive device ). The Kuwaitis also recovered ten cube-shaped plastic explosive devices with detonators (the cube-bombs) from the Landcruiser.

  On April 29, 1993, CIA bomb technicians compared the Bush explosive device to two known Iraqi explosive devices found in different Middle-Eastern countries in 1990 and 1991 (the Middle-East devices ) . The technicians reported that the remote control firing mechanism in the Bush device was identical to those in the Middle-East devices. Additionally, the technicians reported that blasting caps from the Bush device appeared to be identical to those found in one of the Middle-East devices. The technicians later concluded that the circuit board from the Bush device also closely resembled circuit boards from the Middle-East devices. In early-May 1993, the FBI sent personnel to Kuwait to interview the suspects and examine the physical evidence. FBI Special Agents, along with representatives of the Secret Service and State Department, interviewed 16 suspects, some more than once. Two of the suspects, Wali 'Abd Al-Hadi 'Abd Al-Hasan Al-Ghazali ( Al-Ghazali ) and Ra'd 'Abd Al-Amir 'Abbud Al-Asadi (Al-Asadi ), admitted during the FBI interviews that they had participated in the plot at the direction of the IIS.

  Explosives examiner Jordan also traveled to Kuwait in May 1993 to examine the Bush device. Jordan examined the main charge, which was hidden in three panels in the Landcruiser and was capable of being detonated by remote control, a timing device, or a push-pull suicide switch. Jordan compared the Bush device to photographs of the Middle-East devices, as well as other devices, and concluded that the same person or persons manufactured the Bush device and one of the Middle-East devices, and that a connection existed between persons responsible for the Bush device and several other devices, including the other Middle-East device. Jordan reported these conclusions in a May 11, 1993 Laboratory report. Jordan then returned to Washington, D.C., and delivered samples of the explosives from the Bush device to Whitehurst. Whitehurst analyzed the explosive from the main charge and concluded that the substance was approximately 96% RDX, 3% polyvinyl-isobutyl ether binder, and 1% hydrocarbon oil. As for samples from the cube-bombs, Whitehurst concluded that the explosive was consistent with an explosive containing RDX bound with a cross-linked phenoxy or epoxy binder containing Sudan I dye. Whitehurst reported these findings in his June 7, 1993, dictation.

  Shortly thereafter, Jordan returned to the Middle-East to conduct further examinations of the Bush device and the Middle-East devices. Based on these examinations, Jordan reported significant consistencies in the selection of individual components and alterations to manufactured items in all of the devices. Jordan concluded that the similarities represented signature characteristics. He further reported that the same person or persons of close association constructed the remote control fuzing systems and electronic timing mechanisms used in all of these devices. Jordan also reported that a second person or persons of close association were responsible for adding wiring and components to the Bush device and one of the Middle-East devices, enabling those devices to be incorporated in vehicles. Jordan reported these conclusions in his June 18, 1993, Laboratory report, in which he also summarized parts of Whitehurst's June 7, 1993, dictation.

  On June 2, 1993, representatives of the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and others in the Department of Justice (DOJ) discussed the results of their investigations with representatives of the Clinton Administration. Three weeks later, the DOJ and CIA reported their conclusions. The DOJ and CIA reported that it was highly likely that the Iraqi Government originated the plot and more than likely that Bush was the target. Additionally, based on past Iraqi methods and other sources of intelligence, the CIA independently reported that there was a strong case that Saddam Hussein directed the plot against Bush.

  Whitehurst claims that Ronay may have purposely misinterpreted his results in order to suggest involvement by Iraq and support the missile strike by the United States. Contrary to Whitehurst's suggestion, the decision to launch the missile strike did not turn on reports that the Bush and Southeast Asia explosives contained PE-4A. The FBI and CIA assembled extensive evidence of Iraqi involvement, including admissions from two key suspects, forensic examinations of relevant explosive devices, and intelligence from various sources. Our investigation showed that reports that the Laboratory had found PE-4A in the Bush matter and Southeast Asia cases were not a significant part of the overall evidence against the Iraqi Government. Additionally, before the missile strike, the CIA obtained various intelligence reports indicating involvement by the Iraqi Government. The CIA learned that the IIS was planning to assassinate Bush now that he had returned to private life and that the assassination attempt would occur only with authorization from Saddam Hussein. The CIA also received information suggesting that Saddam Hussein had authorized the assassination attempt to obtain personal revenge and intimidate Kuwait and other Arab states.

  In conclusion, the evidence does not support Whitehurst's claim that Ronay purposely changed or misinterpreted Whitehurst's results, either in the Laboratory reports or during discussions of those results. Nor does the evidence support Whitehurst's suggestion that the United States launched the missile strike against the IIS building in Baghdad based on a misinterpretation of Whitehurst's results.<sup>[[1]](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/publications/fbi%20crime%20lab%20doj%20ig%20report%201997.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The First Gulf War, the US liberated Kuwait from Iraq's illegal occupation, which was devastatingly effective, and in full compliance with international law,<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=638&skin=2021)</sup></sup> as emphasis was placed on reducing civilian casualties and collateral damage to infrastructure as much as possible this includes the "highway of death". As the final report to Congress notes: "In the early hours of 27 February, CENTCOM received a report that a concentration of vehicles was forming in Kuwait City. It was surmised that Iraqi forces were preparing to depart under the cover of darkness. CINCCENT was concerned about the redeployment of Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, fearing they could join with and provide reinforcements for Republican Guard units west of Kuwait City in an effort to stop the Coalition advance or otherwise endanger Coalition forces. The concentration of Iraqi military personnel and vehicles, including tanks, invited attack. CINCCENT decided against attack of the Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, since it could lead to substantial collateral damage to Kuwaiti civilian property and could cause surviving Iraqi units to decide to mount a defense from Kuwait City rather than depart. Iraqi units remaining in Kuwait City would cause the Coalition to engage in military operations in urban terrain, a form of fighting that is costly to attacker, defender, innocent civilians, and civilian objects.The decision was made to permit Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait City and engage them in the unpopulated area to the north. In the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm, some questions were raised regarding this attack, apparently on the supposition that the Iraqi force was retreating. The attack was entirely consistent with military doctrine and the law of war. The law of war permits the attack of enemy combatants and enemy equipment at any time, wherever located, whether advancing, retreating, or standing still. Retreat does not prevent further attack. At the small-unit level, for example, once an objective has been seized and the position consolidated, an attacking force is trained to fire upon the retreating enemy to discourage or prevent a counterattack."<sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=664&skin=2021)</sup></sup>
 
   It has also been alleged by conspiracy theorists that the US secretly gave the "greenlight" for Saddam to invade. This is a hoax. An examination of the record indicates the exact opposite: "The common assertion that Saddam perceived a 'green light' from Ambassador April Glaspie or other officials in the months prior to the invasion does not withstand serious scrutiny. In Glaspie’s July 25 meeting with Saddam, she assured her interlocutor of Washington’s desire for friendship and that the United States took no position on the merits of any of the (many) Arab-Arab border demarcation disputes. Taking a legal position on the proper border, Glaspie cabled Washington, would have “change[d] radically our policy.” Yet she also warned Saddam against trying to settle any dispute with Kuwait by force and told the Iraqi leader that the United States would “never excuse settlement of disputes by other than peaceful means”. Moreover, even if Glaspie had given Saddam a “green light” during this meeting, he would almost certainly not have taken this statement at face value given his abiding fear of American perfidy. Saddam smelled an American trap in nearly every initiative launched by Washington and nearly every geopolitical event affecting Iraq. Why would he have now believed that the United States would allow him to dominate the Gulf when it had so assiduously worked to prevent either Iraq or Iran from doing so during the 1980s? We have found nothing in the captured Iraqi documents or recordings indicating that Saddam or his principal advisers perceived a “green light” to invade Kuwait. In fact, the captured documents point in the opposite direction. In the period preceding the invasion, Iraqi officials regularly stated that invading Kuwait would entail a military confrontation with the United States. In 1989, the GMID assessed that Schwarzkopf’s recent visit to Kuwait revealed that 'America has pledged to defend the Gulf States, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to protect them from any aggression they might encounter.' In July 1990, the same agency concluded that, in the event of an Iraqi invasion, Kuwait would receive military support from the United States and potentially from other countries as well. Saddam apparently agreed with this assessment. In a conversation with his advisers shortly after the invasion, he claimed that before invading Kuwait, the Iraqi leadership had taken into account that the United States might retaliate with “a complete boycott” and 'strike us in the air, land, and sea—everywhere.' Saddam did not expect forbearance from a country he considered an aggressive imperial power; he expected conflict." Lastly as Brands points out, "There is one piece of evidence that merits special mention in this regard – a memo written by President Reagan’s first secretary of state, Alexander Haig, following a trip to the Middle East in April 1981. Summarising his conversations in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, Haig wrote, ‘It was also interesting to confirm that President Carter gave the Iraqis a green light to launch the war against Iran through [Crown Prince] Fahd [of Saudi Arabia].’ Although this document is often taken as confirmation of the green light thesis, the actual meaning of the Haig memo remains murky. As the full context of the document indicates, Haig’s comment about a ‘green light’ was not made as an admission by a US official with direct knowledge of any such scheme – Haig had not been in government in September 1980 – but rather as his characterisation of information reported to him by one of his Arab interlocutors (which interlocutor is not clear). The Haig memo therefore provides hard evidence only of the fact that one of the secretary’s sources believed the green light thesis to be true. Haig himself does not seem to have attached a great deal of importance to this assertion – his memo mentions the seemingly explosive issue only once, in a single sentence, before proceeding to other matters."<sup>[[3]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7709.2012.01045.x)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14682745.2011.564612)</sup></sup>

- During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), U.S. military planners identified Al Firdos C3 Bunker (Amiriyah shelter), as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters. The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths. Was there a violation of the LOAC? Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces. Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective. Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made. A review of the targeting policies at the time were determined to be proper.<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=649&skin=2021&q1=Al%20Firdus%20bunker)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://tjaglcs.army.mil/documents/35956/56931/2022+Operational+Law+Handbook.pdf/4e10836e-2399-eb81-768f-7de8f6e03dc5?t=1652119179075)</sup></sup>

- January 1991, it was alleged that USS Nicholas engaged Iraqis on oil platforms who were showing white flags to surrender. This was the case for only a handful of Iraqi personnel who were next to others brandishing weapons at recon helicopters, who were also armed with Surface-to-air missiles and AA Guns. The following day, when the helicopters returned, no white flags were seen, and the demonstrated hostile intent was clear. The USS Nicholas engaged under strict Rules of Engagement and applicable international law.<sup>[[1]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44642452.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35a8f6a42d0569530172e517dcbd6724)</sup></sup>

- In 1991, the United States and allied countries under UNSCR resolution & strict Rules of Engagement, imposed 3 no-fly zone operations to secure the Kurdish people from slaughter at the hands of the brutal Iraqi regime. This measure allowed the Allied nations to also provide humanitarian aid.<sup>[[1]](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1459&context=ils)</sup></sup>

- In August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s army invaded Kuwait and consequently the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Saddam lied about the effect of these sanctions, by manipulating census data. A study published in BMJ Global Health confirms, "Since 2003, however, several more surveys dealing with child mortality have been undertaken. Their results show no sign of a huge and enduring rise in the under-5 death rate starting in 1991. It is therefore clear that Saddam Hussein’s government successfully manipulated the 1999 survey in order to convey a very false impression—something that is surely deserving of greater recognition."<sup>[[1]](https://gh.bmj.com/content/2/2/e000311)</sup></sup>

- In 1988, a US Navy ship accidentally shot down civilian airline flight 655. An independent investigation determined that Iran was at fault for the tragedy. Its actions that day led to the incident. "On the morning of 3 July, MONTGOMERY observed seven IRGC small boats approaching a Pakistani vessel. The number shortly thereafter grew to 13 and they began to challenge nearby merchantmen. VINCENNES was ordered to the area to support MONTGOMERY and launched a helicopter to reconnoiter the scene. In the progress the helicopter was fired upon. VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY closed the general areas of the small boats. Two of the boats turned toward  VINCENNES  and MONTGOMERY while the others began to manoeuvre erratically. These actions were interpreted as manifesting hostile intent and both ships, after being given permission, engaged. This action, involving high speed course changes and gunfire at close range, was still in progress when Air Bus 655 took off from the joint military/civilian airfield at Bandar Abbas and headed toward Dubai. It is hard to overemphasize the fact that Bandar Abbas is also a military airfield. The Air Bus was probable not informed of the surface action taking place in the Strait. Informed or not, Flight 655 logically appeared to have a direct relationship to the ongoing surface engagement. During the critical seven minutes that Flight 655 was airborne, Captain Rogers and his CIC Watch team were integrating a multitude of ongoing events. Specifically, VINCENNES was engaged in a high-speed surface battle with at least two groups of Iranian small boasts—all of which had the capability to inflict serious damage. At the same time, she was monitoring one of her helos which was airborne and had already come under attack.  CIC was also tracking an Iranian P-3 military aircraft airborne approximately 60 nautical miles to the northwest which was presenting a classic  targeting profile. (i.e., furnishing information to an attack aircraft.) In the midst of this highly charged environment, an unknown aircraft took off from a joint military/civilian airport on a flight path headed directly toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. This was the same airfield from which Iran had launched F-4s in support of an attack on US naval forces on 18 April. This unknown aircraft was 27 minutes behind any scheduled commercial airline departure from Bandar Abbas airport. Although it was flying within a known commercial air corridor, it was off centerline some 3 or 4 miles, which was not the usual centerline profile for commercial air traffic previously monitored by VINCENNES. Moreover, its mid-range altitude was consistent with either a hostile or commerical aircraft. VINCENNES could detect no radar emanations from the contact which might identify it, but was reading a Mode III IFF squawk. This situation was confused somewhat when a Mode II IFF squawk was detected and the aircraft was identified as an F-14. Complicating the picture was an Iranian P-3 to the west which was in excellent position to furnish targeting information to an attacking aircraft. More importantly, the unknown contact continued at a gradually increasing speed on a course headed toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. It failed to respond to repeated challenges from VINCENNES over both military and international emergency distress frequencies.<sup>[[1]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6660400-1988-Iran-Plane-Crash-Fp.html#document/p1)</sup></sup>
  
- It has been alleged, that through "Operation Cyclone", the US funded/trained terrorist groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, under the umbrella of the Mujahidin—thus also, creating Bin Laden—to combat the illegal Soviet invasion and occupation on Afghanistan. This is a distortion of reality, and is often misunderstood. While it is true the CIA did aid the Mujahidin, they did so only to moderate factions, under strict vetting for human rights compliance & religious views. These moderates, would be known as the Northern Alliance after the Soviet invasion ended. They fought against AQ and Taliban extremists in the 90s, with US assistance. Ultimately, the US reached out again to the Northern Alliance after the events of 9/11, to go after the terrorist groups. CIA had 0 contact or relationship of Bin Laden during the 80s. Indeed, it is the Soviet's illegal invasion of Afghanistan that created Bin Laden. He used his wealth to fund and supply the Afghan Arabs in the Mujahidin. To quote, "Numerous comments in the media recently have reiterated a widely circulated but incorrect notion that the CIA once had a relationship with Usama Bin Laden. For the record, you should know that the CIA never employed, paid, or maintained any relationship whatsoever with Bin Laden."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/static/c40e6e16c1183e0bed3777f048f41d98/Devotion-to-Duty.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20191101205458/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/cia-the-war-on-terrorism/terrorism-faqs.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/static/9fa9520134e1c2f3068001de69c9964b/Curator-Pocket-History-CIA.pdf#page=86)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf)</sup></sup> At the cost of millions of lives and billions of dollars.

- In May 1985, a Washington Post article alleged CIA had an indirect role of a car bombing incident in Lebanon in March of that same year. 
 CIA reviewed the matter after examining all files and personnel, and concluded no such connection or foreknowledge existed. This was independently verified by a House Intel Committee investigation. "The Committee's review has uncovered no evidence that any US Intelligence Agency — any US Government Agency — has encouraged or participated in any terrorist activity in Lebanon. Further, the Committee was able to discover no evidence that any US Intelligence agency had foreknowledge of the March 8 bombing outside the residence of Sheik Hussein Fadlallah. Its review of relevant documents and files and its interview of appropriate government officials leads to the conclusion that no US Government complicity, direct or indirect, can be established with respect to the March 8 bombing in Beirut."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91-00587R000100720055-4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000807590013-2.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1980s, US had no involvement in the Turkish coup. According to the list's own wiki citation, the alleged source for the claim clarified in a June 2003 interview, "I did not say to Carter "Our boys did it." It is totally a tale, a myth, It is something Birand fabricated. He knows it, too. I talked to him about it." And, "General Kenan Evren said 'the US did not have pre-knowledge of the coup but we informed them of the coup 2 hours in advance due to our soldiers coinciding with the American community JUSMAT that is in Ankara.'" 

- Political pundits and conspiracy theorists claim that the CIA was meddling in Afghanistan prior to the Soviets, in 1979. However, declassified documents in the landmark series, 'Foreign Relations of the United States, 1977–1980, Volume XII, Afghanistan' confirms this to be a still-believed case of Kremlin fake news from the period. While the US did get involved, technically, before the illegal, imperialistic invasion, these actions were only in response to Soviet's covert actions, that were preparing for the invasion. These actions were only intelligence collection and assistance such as food, water, clothing, medical supplies, and propaganda were provided. "U.S. policy in response to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, a process that began with Moscow’s growing involvement in Afghan politics following the Communist revolution in April 1978 and culminating with the mass influx of Soviet military forces in December 1979. Until the Communist coup that overthrew President Mohammed Daoud Khan, U.S. diplomatic and strategic interest in Afghanistan was minor, and focused largely on stanching the flow of illegal narcotics through that country. Prior to 1978, Washington viewed Afghanistan as a relatively stable and non-aligned country that did not figure prominently in the global Cold War competition. Accordingly, Afghanistan was not a major focal point for the first year and a half of the Carter administration. By 1978, at the first sign that Afghanistan may fall into the Soviet orbit, Washington’s interest in Afghanistan increased dramatically." It goes on to detail how the US Government responded to the Kremlin's propaganda, that projected its actions onto the US, "On March 30, 1979, the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs, Zbigniew Brzezinski, informed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that he had sent memoranda to the International Communication Agency (ICA) and the CIA relaying how President Jimmy Carter wanted to respond to Soviet allegations that the United States was meddling in Afghan affairs. (See Document 43.) Brzezinski’s memorandum to Director of Central Intelligence Stansfield Turner, March 30, transmitted Carter’s request to strongly rebuke the Soviet allegation of U.S. involvement in overthrowing the Afghan Government. Brzezinski went on: “All information available to us in recent days has tended to indicate quite the contrary: that the Soviet Union is preparing to intervene in Afghanistan to prop up an unpopular leftist regime and is, in fact, already doing most of the things it is accusing the United States and other countries of doing or preparing to do.” Brzezinski requested a status report by April 6 in response to Carter’s directive." Other documents note, "CIA representatives have been instructed not to delve too deeply with Afghan sources into the theoretical possibility of clandestine support for the rebels, for fear of giving them false signals regarding U.S. intentions."<sup>[[1]](https://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1977-80v12/pdf/frus1977-80v12.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3093334?origin=crossref)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210928211944/https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000278538.pdf)</sup></sup>

  It is further alleged, that the Carter administration tricked, and trapped Moscow in a Vietnam-style quagmire. The often cited "smoking-gun" evidence for this claim, comes from an interview with French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur in January 1998, former U.S. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. However, a careful, thorough, and incisive 2020 study reveals this is nothing more than a myth, contradicted by declassified documents, and other critical source examination. "The French interview has had a major impact on the historiography, being used as the almost sole basis to prove the existence of a concerted effort to lure Moscow into the “Afghan trap.” There are, however, significant problems with it as an historical source. First, the title is deceptive. It reads (in translation): “The revelations of a former adviser to Carter: ‘Yes, the CIA came into Afghanistan before the Russians . . .’” Quotation marks and ellipsis indicate that this is a direct quote from Brzezinski and implies CIA operations inside Afghanistan before December 1979, which does not fit with the historical record. Although insisting on the accuracy of the interview, the journalist has since conceded that the quote in the title was not actually from Brzezinski but was “invented” by the editors, which casts doubt on the subsequent text.6 Secondly, the published remarks were heavily edited and Brzezinski has denied the article’s accuracy on numerous occasions, asserting that it was “not an interview, but excerpts from an interview that was originally supposed to be published in full but which they never checked with me for approval in the form that it did appear.”7 It is also likely a casualty of translation—being conducted in English, translated and printed in French, and reconverted to English—with the original statements becoming skewed and distorted in their edited and translated form. Additionally, many of the interview’s claims are unsupported by documentary evidence. For example, Brzezinski has denied he ever sent a note claiming the covert aid would “lead to a Soviet military intervention,” and no such note, nor references to it, has ever been found. Nowhere else has Brzezinski ever referred to a systematic plan for the “Afghan trap” and neither in his subsequent actions, writings, interviews, or public remarks on the topic has he shown any satisfaction that his strategy had worked. It is highly questionable that Brzezinski would attempt to bolster his reputation and disclose information on a secret plan to ensnare Moscow in an Afghan quagmire in just one foreign interview and then subsequently and repeatedly deny it. The editing, translation, inventions, and lack of final approval and corroborating documentation generates doubts on the accuracy of the words attributed to Brzezinski and, ultimately, if this one unreliable interview is discounted there is very little legitimate evidence to back up the “trap” thesis. The nascent covert program was a consequence of the Soviets’ “creeping intervention,” not its cause, and carefully calibrated to avoid provoking an invasion. Brzezinski’s actions through 1979 demonstrated an effort to dissuade intervention through publicizing the growing Soviet presence and warning directly of the consequences of intervention, and his post-invasion actions belie the argument that bogging down the Soviets in an unrelenting insurgency was his objective. The limited pre-invasion covert program is wholly insignificant to charge the Carter administration with actively attempting to induce an invasion, and thus causing the subsequent decades of destabilization in Afghanistan. It is, as Mondale wrote, “a huge, unwarranted leap to conclude that the CIA plan was designed to provoke a Soviet intervention when we were, in fact, trying to discourage one."<sup>[[4]](https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/44/2/237/5699276?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the US Government sold out, and abandoned the Kurds in 1975. However, a critical review of the declassified records finds no basis in this charge. As one world-renowned scholar Bryan Gibson, "Despite the widely held view that the United States sold the Kurds out in March 1975, the decision was presented as a fait accompli. While Kissinger had known that the Shah was considering abandoning the Kurds, he believed that he had talked him out of it. At least, this was the thrust of Kissinger’s letter to Barzani in February 1975, when he agreed to meet with a Kurdish emissary. Nevertheless, Kissinger saw the Kurdish intervention as a valuable means of advancing US Middle Eastern strategy. After all, the Kurdish intervention had tied down Iraq’s army during the October War, allowed Kissinger to secure Israel’s disengagement from Syria, and prevented the formation of a strong Iraqi government. In the end, Kissinger’s frustration upon learning that the Shah had ignored his advice and had reached agreement with Saddam Hussein in Algiers is explained by his belief that the Kurds were a valuable Cold War card, to be used to advance US interests, while denying the Soviet Union a strong base of influence. This study shows that both the Pike Report and William Safire’s highly critical articles have had a distorting effect on the historiographical discourse on the Kurdish War. The primary objective of the US operation was to increase the Kurds’ bargaining power with Baghdad in order to help them secure reasonable terms on autonomy. Nevertheless, both the Pike Report and Safire’s articles do not represent an objective assessment of the Ford administration’s handling of the Kurdish intervention. This study has shown that the Pike Report ignored inconvenient truths; manipulated evidence; misattributed quotes; falsely accused the United States of not providing the Kurds with any humanitarian assistance;  and, finally, claimed that Kissinger had not responded to Barzani’s tragic plea,  when in fact he had. None of these claims appeared to be substantiated. As Gerald Haines argues, the Pike Report’s real purpose was to expose the CIA as a “rogue elephant” and scale back the White House’s control over foreign policy.11 In other words, this was not the “textbook case of betrayal and skullduggery” that the Pike Report had led many people to believe."<sup>[[1]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137517159)</sup></sup>

- During the 1974 Cyprus crisis, Nixon issued a last-ditch diplomatic effort via a stern warning letter to the Turkish Government to prevent an invasion of Cyprus. This letter reflected that of the Lyndon B. Johnson letter that prevented the invasion in 1964. However, the Ambassador to Turkey did not transmit the letter to Turkey. A study finds, "In his own approach to Turkey, though, Kissinger wanted to appeal to reason rather than fear. He mainly sought to deconstruct the Turkish assumption that the military solution would leave Turkey better off in Cyprus."<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2021.1935293)</sup></sup>

- Despite many allegations, no evidence exists that the US supported either or both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict. It is confirmed that the USSR was a major supplier for chemical agents and other gear to Iraq.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170124020754/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90T01298R000300670001-8.pdf)</sup></sup> The US led the global embargo effort against Iraq to prevent it from acquiring chemical weapons. CIA only, naturally, monitored the conflict—it is after all—the _Central Intelligence Agency_.<sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81B00401R000500030002-5.pdf)</sup></sup> Some conspiracy theorists and their historical revisionist supporters, suggest that there was indeed evidence: Edward A. Johnson was convicted of crimes which focused on sales between 1982 and 1987 to Chilean purchasers of zirconium which was made into cluster bombs sold to Iraq. Although the export of the zirconium for this purpose was prohibited by laws of the United States, Johnson sought to defend the charges against him by establishing that the United States — in particular, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the Central Intelligence Agency and high ranking members of the military — encouraged the Teledyne companies, Johnson's employers, to export the zirconium, knowing the purchasers would use it to manufacture cluster bombs for Iraq, because at that time the United States was secretly supporting Iraq in its war with Iran.

  However, the Courts carefully and fully examined the classified record—finding no such thing ever happened. "The court carefully reviewed classified government documents and found no evidence supporting Johnson's theory that the CIA had secretly arranged to supply Cardoen with zirconium. After our own review of these classified materials, we agree with the district court that the government did not withhold any evidence supporting Johnson's "CIA" theory."<sup>[[3]](https://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/19955021.OPN.pdf)</sup></sup>

- CIA had no involvement in Saddam's rise to power. According to the world's most authoritative examination, "New documentary revelations have helped clear up various claims made about the CIA’s operations inside Iraq during 1961–62. It has been suggested, for instance, that the CIA urged the Kurds to rebel against Baghdad in this period; however, documents reveal that US diplomats and intelligence officers in the field had warned Washington of an impending war and were ignored. Furthermore, evidence from Soviet archives suggests that Soviet intelligence officers might have urged Barzani to fight in 1961. It has also been alleged that the CIA tried to “incapacitate” Qasim in 1961–62 by mailing him a poisoned handkerchief, but again the evidence suggests that Mahdawi, the pro-communist head of the People’s Court, would have been a more likely target. Finally, it has been widely believed that the CIA was behind the Ba’thist coup that overthrew Qasim in February 1963. The CIA was indeed plotting against Qasim in the 1962–63 period; nonetheless, it has also been uncovered that the CIA was also engaged in a major intelligence gathering operation, which was primarily aimed at gaining information about Soviet antiaircraft weaponry. With access to a virtual “intelligence bonanza” at stake, the Kennedy administration showed great reluctance about aggravating Qasim. Such a bold move, like overthrowing the Iraqi government, would have probably been deemed too risky at the time. Moreover, a high-level CIA official, who claimed to have helped plot Qasim’s demise, has divulged that the CIA’s plans to overthrow Qasim had not yet been finalized when the Ba’th Party seized power. In sum, barring the release of new information, the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA not behind the February 1963 Ba’thist coup." Gibson continues, "the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA was not behind the February 1963 Ba’thist coup.... While it has been suggested that the United States instigated the revolt to undermine the Qasim regime, evidence shows the opposite. The Shelepin memo suggests that the Soviets had hoped to use Iraq’s Kurdish minority to distract the United States and its allies from the Berlin Crisis by threatening America’s regional allies, Iran and Turkey, both of which had large Kurdish minorities. In reality, the origins of the revolt were largely indigenous, relating mostly to Qasim’s failed land reforms and his divide-and-rule tactics." Other scholars like Peter Hahn observes that "no declassified US documents support this claim."

  It is also alleged that the CIA provided lists of communists and leftists to the Ba’th Party in the early 60s. Hanna Batatu, a Palestinian Marxist historian finds the Ba’th had “ample opportunity to gather such particulars in 1958–59, when the Communists came wholly into the open." Gibson and others concur, "This explanation actually makes perfect sense and is supported by documents that suggest the Ba’th Party had created its own lists during 1958–59. For instance, an INR analysis from February 15 stated, '[Communist] party members [are being] rounded up on the basis of lists prepared by the now-dominant Ba’th Party.' A separate INR analysis from February 21 pointed out that during the 1958–59 period, the communists had “exposed virtually all its assets” whom the Ba’th had “carefully spotted and listed.”<sup>[[1]](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137517159)</sup></sup>

- 1953, Iran. The list [claims](https://imgur.com/a/ZckJs0s) that the CIA "replaced" Mossadeq with the Shah. It should be obviously clear why this is a display of full ignorance: Who appointed him? Due to many myths and sensational headlines, great detail is needed to provide background, context and clarify actual events as they actually happened. Furher, yes, the CIA did admit involvement—however, it would be a stretch to call it a coup. It was "an exercise of the Shah's constitutional prerogative and authority. Mossadeq's failure to abide by the firmans would make his tenure as Prime Minister illegal." Since conspiracy theorists and pundits like to reference headlines on what the "CIA admits", the following will be direct quotes from two authoritative documents only:

  "An Islamic fundamentalist assassinated Iranian Prime Minister General Ali Razmara on 7 March 1951. Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi—who had become Shah when his father, Reza Shah, abdicated in 1941-appointed Mossadeq as Prime Minister on 29 April1 951. Shah's initial choice to succeed Razmam, Hussein Ala, had resigned after only a few weeks. Severe economic and political problems awaited the Mossndeq, and it was not obvious that he had the skill to solve them. Mossadeq's immediate concern was a struggle for control of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). By 1950 the British oil concession in Iran, which the Shah had renewed in 1949, was a sore point in relations between the two countries. In March 1951, when Mossadeq was a member of the Majlis (the Iranian Parliament), he submitted a bill, which the Majlis quickly passed, nationalizing AIOC. He signed the bill into law on 1 May 1951, just three days after the Shah appointed him Prime Minister. Nationalization went into effect on 2 May 1951 and was made retroactive to 20 March 1951. AIOC's nationalization brought Mossadeq and Iran into immediate conflict with Britain. The British government owned half of AIOC's stock and did not intend to let Mossadeq nationalize its assets without adequate compensation as required under international law. 

  The flash point came in July 1952, when Mossadeq resigned during a dispute over whether the Shah or the Prime Minister should appoint the war minister. During the elections for the 17th Majlis earlier in the year, vote-tampering by the Iranian Royal Court had convinced Mossadeq that the government's survival depended on control of the military. On 16 July he demanded the right to appoint himself (unconstituonally) minister of war. The Shah refused and Mossadeq resigned. Mossadeq's resignation initially appeared to be a shrewd political move that underscored his mastery of Iranian politics and his ability to gauge and exploit public opinion. The Shah appointed Ahmad Qavam, Prime Minister during the Azeri crisis with the Soviet Union in 1947, to succeed Mossadeq. Tn response, the National Front, a broad coalition fonned in 1949, organized mass demonstrations in Tehran demanding Mossadeq's return. The demonstrations turned violent-69 people died and more than 750 were injured-but the Shah refused to use the police or the military to restore order. Qavam lacked broad support and was unable to organize counter-demonstrations. For five days the National Front controlled the streets of Tehran and other cities. On 21 July 1952 the Shah bowed to the pressure and replaced Qavam with Mossadeq. Once back in power, Mossadeq struck back at the Shah and the military. He transferred Reza Shah's lands back to the State, appointed himself Minister of War, forced the Shah's twin sister Princess Ashraf to leave the country, and forbade Mohammed Reza Pahlavi from communicating directly with foreign diplomats. By May 1953, according to Iranian specialist Ervand Abrahamian, "the shah had been stripped of all the powers he had fought for and recovered since August 1941." The Prime Minister also seized the opportunity to purge the Iranian officer corps. He forcibly retired many Royalist officers, and cut the military budget 15%. To add to the insult, Mossadeq transferred 15,000 men from the military to the Gendarmerie, the military's bureaucratic rival. These acts fueled smoldering resentment among the dismissed officers and those few royalists escaping Mossadeq's purge.  Mossadeq's apparent political triumph rapidly turned sour. The National Front began to unravel in late 1952 and early 1953 as the Prime Minister grew increasingly dictatorial. By November 1952, Ayatollah Abul Quasscm Kashani, a key Islamic cleric in the National Front, had turned against Mossadeq and quit the Front, as had Mozaffar Baqai's Toilers' Party. Kashani's defection was a particularly hard blow because his group, the Warriors of Islam, included the bazaar merchants of Tehran and many mullahs (Islamic clerics). Support from these two groups historically has been critical to Iranian governments.

  The reasons for the defections were complex. Although 30 of the 79 deputies of the 17th Majlis, convened in February 1952, belonged to or identified with the National Front, they represented different constituencies and interests were united only in their opposition to the British. In addition, nationalization of the AIOC did not produce the bonanza for Iran that Mossadeq had hoped it would. He began to demand more and more power from the Majlis, and when the legislature granted the Prime Minister what amounted to dictatorial powers, Ayatollah Kashani resigned as Majlis speaker. Toilers' Party leader Mozaffar Baqai compared Mossadeq to Hitler and praised the army as a bulwark against Communism. As support for Mossndeq narrowed, the Tudeh would soon be the only group willing to take to the streets on his behalf. Ayatollah Kashani's defection and increased squabbling among the deputies effectively paralyzed the Majlis. Opposition politicians-including fonner Mossadeq allies like Kashani-blocked the Prime Minister's legislation. In early June 1953, fistfights broke out in the Majlis. The Prime Minister won a temporary victory when Abdullah Moazemi, a Mossadeq supporter, succeeded Kashani as speaker in a close Majlis vote (41 to 31) on 1 July 1953. Mossadeq recognized, however, that the Majlis was hopelessly deadlocked and that dissolution and new elections were necessary to break the stalemate. Under the Iranian constitution only the Shah could dissolve the Majlis. The government could request him to do so. Mossadeq knew the Shah would not agree to such a proposal, so he devised a plan to achieve the same end. He asked all National Front members and supporters to resign, which they did, and simultaneously announced the dissolution of the Majlis. The Iranian people, he held, could ratify or reject his decision in a referendum on the theory that popular will superseded the constitution. Iranian scholar Ervand Abrahamian has noted the irony in Mossadeq's rationale. "Mossadeq, the constitutional lawyer who had meticulously quoted the fundamental laws against the shah," Abrahamian wrote, "was now bypassing the same laws and resorting to the theory of the general will." From 3 to 10 August 1953, Iranians voted on Mossadeq's bold and unconstitutional act. The results of the rigged election were never in doubt. Mossadeq purposely ex.cluded rural areas from the balloting, ostensibly because it would take too long to count the votes from remote areas. The ballot was not secret, and there were separate polling places for "yes" and "no ." In the end, Mossadeq claimed victory, gaining "over 2,043,300 of the 2,044,600 ballots cast throughout the country and 101,396 of the 101,463 ballots cast in the capital." The dissolution of the Majlis and the tainted referendum alienated Iranian liberals and conservatives alike. Jamal Imami, a pro-British member of the Majlis, warned that Mossadeq was leading the country toward anarchy. Ayatollah Kashani declared the referendum illegal under Islamic religious law.

  A US Embassy assessment cabled to Washington shortly after the referendum stated that the dissolution of the Majlis "will graphically demonstrate truism of [Mossadeq's] regime that as opposition and discontent have mounted, Mossadeq has moved steadily in authoritarian direction using technique of mobocracy to maintain his hold on power and to eliminate influence Shah." Nonetheless, the Embassy thought Mossadeq's continued appeals to the street could boomerang because he lacked "any real authoritarian organization aside from armed forces." To compensate. according to the Embassy. he would be forced to rely increasingly on the Tudeh. thereby alienating the non-Communist followers of his Government.

  US perspective: 

  Mossadeq Looks for American Support: Secretary of State Acheson thought that the British were overly preoccupied with their oil interests and that London did not fully understand the broader Communist threat. He saw Mossadeq as a potentially important part of the solution to the problem of Soviet influence in the Middle East. In Acheson's view, the Iranian Prime Minister would in time become an effective bulwark against Soviet penetration into Iran. To that end, Washington consistently urged London to reach an equitable settlement with Tehran. Acheson apparently was convinced that an agreement would strengthen the Iranian government and promote regional stability. The suggestion that British forces might occupy the port city of Abadan or launch some other military action against Iran set off alarms in ONE. In an April 1951 memorandum to DCI Lt. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, ONE chief Dr. William Langer warned that the appearance of British troops in Iran might result in Soviet occupation of the norther part of the country under the terms of the 1921 treaty of friendship between Persia and Soviet Russia. Neither Langer nor any of the Iran specialists in CIA's clandestine service the Office of Special Operations (OSO), and the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) thought the Tudeh was strong enough by itself to topple Mossadeq. As long as the central government remained able to deal with events, Langer and others saw the danger of a Tudeh coup as negligible. "Tudeh represents a serious threat in view of the opportunities awaiting it," OSO and OPC specialists agreed in January 1952, "but does not yet have the intention or the ability to gain actual control of the government at this time either by force or political means." CIA's operators thought that the Tudeh would come to power only through chaos and impotent central authority. Although the documents in CIA's files do not indicate that Smith relayed Langer's concerns to President Truman, he evidently did so because the administration subsequently let London know that the US Government disapproved of any military action against Iran. At a British cabinet meeting in September 1951, the government of Prime Minister Clement Attlee decided that it "could not afford to break with the United States on an issue of this kind." As of 30 July 1952, the State Department and CIA were committed to supporting Mossadeq. That evening, CIA representatives met at the State Department with Secretary of State Acheson, Under Secretary of State David K.E. Bruce, Charles Bohlen, Henry Byroade, John Jemegan, and Robert Joyce, all of the State Department.40 The participants decided that "It is the policy of the Department of State to maintain the present government in Iran so long as this government has the authority to govern, or until it appears certain that the government will be taken over by the Communists."


  As the foregoing indicates, Washington and London had fundamentally different perspectives on the events in Iran and on their consequences worldwide. These differences complicated the State Department's and Foreign Office's search for a common policy. At times the problems must have appeared insolvable. In January 1952 an internal memorandum in the State Department's Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs identified two areas of disagreement. The United States and the United Kingdom had differing views on the strength of nationalism in Iran (and therefore on Mossadeg's political strength), and on the global consequences of Tehran's failure to reach an oil settlement with London. The State Department recognized that Iranian nationalism was a potent and growing force, making an oil settlement on British terms unattainable even if Mossadeg fell. In contrast, the British disparaged Iranian nationalism as merely a "passing storm." It had no roots and would "pass and its leaders fall as soon as it is demonstrated that their policies have brought Iran to the brink of ruin." More specifically, American officials feared that a British failure to compromise with Mossadeq would enable him to whip up Iran's virulent nationalism further, with potentially disastrous results. The West might well lose so much of its influence that it could not stop Tehran from moving the Soviet orbit. Or the Iranian political situation could simply descend into chaos, in which case the Soviet-backed Tudeh-Iran's best organized, best financed, and most effective political organization- would be ready to fill the vacuum. In the State Department's view, such developments would jeopardize the security and stability of the entire Middle East, would serve notice that the West could not preserve the independence of important Third World states, and could deprive the West not only of Iran's oil but ultimately that of its Arab neighbors as well. 

  The only suggestion for resolving these differences offered in the State Department's internal memorandum further consultation to determine the "political, military, economic, and psychological effects of the loss of Iran to the west as balanced against the political and economic effects of an agreement with the Iranians on the oil situation which might prejudice other concessions elsewhere and diminish British prestige throughout the world." The memorandum concluded that unless the US and United Kingdom agreed on the importance to the West of an independent Iran, there was little chance the two would be able to forge a common policy. Eleven months later the National Security Council set forth basic US policy toward Iran. NSC 136/1 emphasized that the United States was committed to preventing Iran from falling under communist control and that Iran's strategic position, its oil, and its vulnerability to Soviet political subversion or military attack made it a tempting target for Soviet expansion. If the Tudeh Party seized or attempted to seize control of the Iranian goverment, the document argued, the United States should, in conjunction with the British, be ready to support a non-communist Iranian government militarily, economically, diplomatically, and psychologically. The collapse of the Anglo-Iranian oil negotiations had changed the Americans' attitude; Washington now considered Mossadcq a source of instability and feared that his continued tenure invited a Tudeh coup. The United States suspected the Soviets of trying to take advantage of the deteriorating situation in Iran. In the US view, Soviet leaders undoubtedly saw Mossadeq's troubles as a diplomatic opening, and if he wanted to try to play Moscow against Washington, the Soviets would let him. The Kremlin would help him. The potential benefits to the Soviets of cultivating Mossadcq were great: a docile southern neighbor at a minimum, and beyond that, a chance to draw a strategically important country into the Soviet sphere of influence.

  TPAJAX:

  Initial plans involved a military coup that would, because of the Shah's participation, be fundamentally legal. The Shah's role would be to sign 3 documents: a royal decree (firman, in Farsi) naming Zahedi as Army Chief of Staff; another firman appealing to all ranks of the army to carry out the orders of the new Chief of Staff; and, an open letter calling on army officers to support the bearer, General Zahedi. The letter would be used by Zahedi to recruit the coup group of officers in key posts that would enable them to carry out all military objectives of the plan. However, State set forth two conditions that had to be met: 1) the United States must be prepared to offer immediate and substantial economic assistance--an estimated $60 million the first year--to the new government in Iran in order to stabilize the economy and convince the public that their new government would be able to do more for them than the old one, and 2) the British must give a firm commitment to be flexible in approaching the oil settlement and not attempt to force the new government to accept terms that would alienate public opinion. To be acceptable, State said, the oil settlement should recognize nationalization of the oil industry, provide for Iranian control of all property, installations, and production in Iran, allow the Iranian. government complete freedom of choice of technical and managerial personnel as well as freedom in the sales of oil and oil product, and dispose of the problem of compensation within the framework of the existing nationalization law and on a basis which would not saddle Iran with excessive indebtedness to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Probably the biggest question mark for TAJAX planners was the Shah's role in the coup--not only how he would play it, but would he even play it at all? They had little reason to be overconfident, for his indecision and susceptibility to bad advice were notorious. The Shah had his reasons, however. He had assumed the throne in 1941 when his father, a semiliterate strongman, was forced to abdicate by the occupying power, Britain and the USSR. Leader of a defeated and humiliated country for the first 42 years of his reign, the young Shah attempted to survive by ruling as a constitutional monarch. His very existence was threatened by Tudeh on the left and by Premier Ahmed Qavam on the right; a British correspondent who interviewed him in 1947 described him as "a very frightened young man." Although Qavam, as a strong Premier, was in a position to bring the Pahlavi dynasty to a premature end, he apparently decided to keep the monarchy and took steps to build up the Shah's popularity, crediting him with recovering Azarbaijan from the Soviets. Seemingly stimulated by this appearance of success, the Shah took a more active role as rule, and in 1947 began to intervene more vigorously in political affairs. The attempted assassination by a Tudeh Party member in 1949 frightened him again, but he survived the shots and cast about for some stabilizing factors in his situation. The U.S. Embassy made this assessment of him in 1951: The Shah is confused, frustrated, suspicious, proud, and stubborn, a young man who lives in the shadow of his father. His fears, questioning, and indecisiveness are permanent instabilities of character. Yet, he has great personal courage, many Western ideals, and a sincere, though often wavering, desire to raise and preserve his country. He is, at all times, eager for and a victim of advice.

  The first phase of the operation began on 15 July 1953, when Asadollah Rashidian went to the French Riviera to meet Princess Ashraf. He explained to her that Mossadeq posed a continuing danger for Iran and that she should convince her brother to dismiss. him. She was unenthusiastic. The Princess also was convinced that Mossadeq would do whatever he could to prevent her return. She had already written to the Prime Minister three times, saying that she wanted to come back to Iran because she could no longer afford to live in Europe. When she saw, with some prompting, that a surreptitious visit to the Shah might improve her chances of returning home permanently, she began to warm to the idea. Princess Ashraf arrived in Tehran on 25 July 1953 and met with her brother four days later. She was unable to convince him to sign the firmans and left Tehran the following day.

  In the early days of August, Roosevelt compelled to build up the pressure on the Shah. Alterations were made in the original plan with regard to the firmans the Shah was to sign; one was to name Zahedi as Chief of Staff, while the other would declare illegal the referendum dissolving the Majlis. But, getting the actual documents signed was becoming a critical matter. saw the Shah on 2 August and left the palace believing he had obtained the Shah's agreement to dismiss Mosadeq and appoint Zahedi as Premier, but when Roosevelt met with the ruler the following day, he had become reluctant to act, saying that he was not an adventurer and could not take chances like one. Roosevelt's argument was that the government could be changed in no other way, and that if the Shah did not join with the army to oust Mosader, either a Comunist Iran or another Korean-type conflict was inevitable: These alternatives the United States, was not prepared to accept. At this meeting, the Shah asked for direct assurance from President Eisenhower that he approved of the Shah's taking the initiative against Mosadeq, but before this could be passed to Washington, the President fortuitously inserted an item in his speech to the Governors' Conference in Seattle on 4 August to the effect that the United States could not sit idly by and watch Iran fall behind the iron Curtain. Roosevelt used the coincidence of this speech by telling the Shah that the President's comment on Iran had been made to satisfy him, but the ruler continued to balk. On 3 August, the Shah, still irresolute, told Roosevelt that he would send a message of encouragement to the army officers involved, then go to the palace at Ramsar on the Caspian and let the army act, apparently without his official knowledge. If that action were successful, he would name Zahedi as Premier. but the Shah said that while he approved of the planned action, he would not sign any documents. The next part remains classified, however, continues, 'Under this extreme pressure, the Shah finally agreed to sign the papers, see Zahedi personally, and then leave for Ramsar. The next day he did meet with the general, but the firmans were not yet ready to be signed. The Shah went on to Ramsar, after promising to sign the decrees as soon as they were brought to him. Roosevelt then altered the plan one final time by deciding that one firman should dismiss Mosadeg from the Premier's post and the other name Zahedi as his successor. The Shah's firmans changed the entire character of TPAJAX. No longer was the operation essentially a military coup with the aim of installing Zahedi as Chief of the General Staff and then Prime Minister. Now it was an exercise of the Shah's constitutional prerogative and authority. Mossadeq's failure to abide by the firmans would make his tenure as Prime Minister illegal. The Shah's decrees were now in the hands of the coup group, and the next step was to implement the military action plan as soon as possible. One point seems clear, although the exact details are missing--the initial coup attempt was betrayed. Rumors of a coup to be staged by the army had been in the air for some time, and the Iranians' desultory view of security and their tendency to be talkative were notorious, but according to Roosevelt, it was probably chief of the secret police, who told Chief of Staff Riahi that the coup was coming the night of 15 August. What happened to the other coup officers with assigned missions? A number of them heard the news that the coup was blown and so did nothing. Others were frustrated by the precautions General Riahi took when he learned the coup was coming that night. On Monday the 17th, the Shah did make a number of statements that were broadcast over the Baghdad radio, insisting that he had not abdicated, that he was confident of the loyalty to him of the Iranian people, and that he had indeed dismissed Premier Mosadeq and appointed Zahedi under his constitutional prerogatives.

  Foreign Minister Fatemi, who had been released at dawn on the 16th along with the rest of the handful of prisoners taken in the coup attempt, held a press conference at 1400 that afternoon in which he implicated the Court and blamed the Imperial Guard for planning the coup. He said that his own views would be found in an editorial in his paper, Bakhtar Emruz, which was also read over Radio Tehran at 1730—it was a long, inflammatory, and savage attack on the Shah and his dead father. Its broadcast and subsequent printing was credited with doing much to stir up the Tudeh-led anti-Shah mobs that raged through Tehran on 17 and 18 August. At the same time, the violence of its tone and language aroused much public synpathy for the Shah. Fatemi Spoke again at 1930 to the crowds massed in Majlis Square, as did a number of pro-Mosadeq Majlis deputies. The Shah was sharply attacked by every speaker; there were insistent demands for his abdication, and the people were told for the first time that he had left the country. Tuesday, the loth, became a day of waiting. the Shah and Queen Soroya flew to Rome from Baghdad that morning; when he arrived at 1500, he made additional statements to the press but did not issue a call to action by the forces supporting him. In Tehran, bands of Tudehites still roamed the streets, and a mob sacked the headquarters of the Pan-Iran Party and small Tudeh and National Front mobs fought each other. The secret police attempted to prevent the publication of opposition newspapers, but a number of them, including Dad and Shahed, were able to get on the streets with replicas of the Shah's firmans. Mosadeq's spokesmen on Radio Tehran announced that a 100,000-rial reward would be paid for information on the whereabouts of General Zahedi and that all demonstrations were banned. General Riahi addressed a meeting of all senior officers of the Tehran garrison at the lecture hall of the Military School and told them in very strong terms that they should remain loyal to the government. Despite the ban on demonstrations, there was continued fighting in the streets on the evening of 18 August Mosadeq's security forces were sent out to clear the streets, and their operations took on a strong anti-Tudeh tone as they beat up demonstrators and forced them to shout pro-Shah slogans. Belatedly realizing what was happening, Tudeh leaders went out into the streets to try to talk the demonstrators into going home, but the excesses of two days of anti-Shah rioting had already done their damage. Early on the morning of the 19th, pro-Shah groups began to gather in the bazaar area in south Tehran, who had been stirred up by Tudeh actions and who were looking for leadership. As the various groups of demonstrators moved northward out of south Tehran, they merged as they reached sepah Square, where they met the troops sent to turn them back. The soldiers fired hundreds of shots over their heads, but whether the order to fire into the crowd was never given or was ignored, they did not shoot into the mob. Sensing that the army was with them, the demonstrators not only began to move faster but took on a festive, holiday atmosphere. it had become a mob wholly different from any seen before in Tehran; it was full of well-dressed, white-collar people, carrying pictures of the Shah and shouting, "Zindebah, Shah!'(Long live the Shah!). Then, the troops began to join in the demonstration. 

  Troops from the Imperial Guard, which had been disbanded ofter its involvement in the 15 August coup attempt, had gathered, and truckloads of soldiers began driving through the streets, shouting and waving pictures of the Shah. Drivers kept their lights on, as they had been asked to do as a sign they supported the Shah. By mid-morning, after the demonstrators had reached Sepah Square and fanned out into the center of the city, General Riahi reported to Mosadeq that he no longer controlled the army, but the Premier told him to hold firm. Mosadeq's house, a prime target of the demonstrators, was being defended by Colonel Momtaz' battalion. Radio Tehran was a key target, since it would not only be able to broadcast the news of the success of the shah's forces in the capital but would also help convince the provinces to join in supporting the Zahedi government. It was important, also, to get it in unsabotaged condition, ready to broadcast. During the morning hours on the 19th it had been broadcasting cotton prices, then switched to recorded music uninterrupted by news bulletins. Shortly before 1430, it suddenly went off the air, apparently as the pro-Shah troops and demonstrators took control of the building in a short, sharp struggle. When it resumed • broadcasting, after a short period of "technical difficulties," all that could be heard was a confused babble of happy voices. Zahedi taken was to Radio Tehran, where he made his speech. In it he promised to restore the rule of law, individual freedom, and freedom of assembly, and he added some popular items such as raising wages, cutting the cost of living, providing free medical treatment, and building more roads. The speech was recorded and broadcast again that night. The troops guarding the residence were unsure of what was happening. When confronted with the large, angry crowd, some of the soldiers opened fire. The fighting escalated as pro-Shah troops returned fire.

  Newspaper accounts of the coup, in particular lennett Love's dispatch to The New York Times which was based on local newspaper accounts, grossly exaggerated the casualties. Love's story said that more than 300 people were killed or wounded, that Mosadeq's house was stormed by Sherman tanks which in turn were battered by shells from loyalist tanks, and that Colonel Momtaz; who led the defenders at the Premier's house, was "torn to pieces" by the mob. "Torn to pieces" was a favorite of Love's; he used it to describe what happened to Foreign Minister Fatemi in his newspaper office. In fact, however, casualties of he coup were relatively light considering the number of people involved; the official toll was 43 dead and 35 wounded, and neither Momtaz nor Fatemi was even scratched, let alone dismembered. Mosadeq, whom the journalists variously described as slipping up a ladder and over his back wall in his pajamas or lying weeping in bed (also in pajamas) when the troops burst in, was not even in his house when it was attacked. He had gone next door and taken temporary refuge with U.S. Point Four chief Willian Warne, who was somewhat embarrassed to have a deposed Premier on his hands, even for a brief period. Over the next few days, Mossadeq and other senior officials of his government turned themselves in or were arrested.

  TPAJAX and the National Interest: the Contemporaneous View:

  Official Washington thought that TPAJAX was a stunning victory for the West. The operation almost certainly prevented Iran from sliding into political anarchy and becoming a target too tempting for the Tudeh and its Soviet mentors to ignore. In the short term, a stable Zahedi Government permitted a rapid settlement of the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute, thereby restarting the flow of oil and providing a much-needed boost for the sagging Iranian economy.  At the time, neither Washington nor London could foresee the long-range benefits that would flow from TPAJAX. The pro-Western, strongly anti-Communist policy of the Zahedi Government that the United States obtained at minimal cost2 would last for 26 years. Secure in the knowledge that the US would support Iran against the USSR, the Shah was able to turn his attention to domestic matters. He began a series of far-reaching modernization efforts, including land reform and steps toward the emancipation of women. TPAJAX came at a time when the events in pre-war Europe were a fresh memory. Americans had seen how Nazi subversion could destroy a country like Czechoslovakia. They had seen the consequences of weakness and appeasement before Nazi and Japanese demands. They had suffered the incalculable cost of failing to act when action might have stopped further aggression. Many were determined never again to let the appearance of weakness and indecision encourage aggression. Neither the White House nor State Department had the slightest doubt that the Soviets coveted Iran and would do whatever they could, short of war, to bring that country within the Soviet orbit. The Azeri crisis of 1947 showed that unless checked, Stalin would continue to test the West's resolve. Stalin's death in March 1953 added a dangerous element of ambiguity to Soviet intentions. Who would succeed the late dictator, the "breaker of nations"?

  Would Soviet policy become more or less aggressive? Would the Soviets reoccupy Iranian Azerbaijan? Would they encourage the Tudeh to topple Mossadeg? The White House, the State Department, and CIA struggled to find answers to these questions. Sending American troops to Iran was never a practical option for logistical and political reasons. An American military occupation almost certainly would have led to war. The USSR would have invoked the terms of the 1921 Treaty of Friendship Between Iran and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and occupied the northern part of the country. Iran would have been divided into a Communist north and a free south. Fear of partition lay behind Washington's objection to the proposed British occupation of the port city of Abadan early in the oil nationalization crisis. A covert political operation promised to attain American foreign policy and strategic in objectives Iran without the threat of war. CIA gave the Eisenhower administration flexibility where diplomacy had failed and military action was not practical. In addition, CIA gave the US Government "plausible deniability." If a covert action went awry, the President could deny American involvement. With these considerations in mind, and given the widely held Western outlook on the international situation in general and on Soviet intentions in particular, the Eisenhower administration's decision to act in Iran was reasonable and understandable.

  TPAJAX and the National Interest: The Retrospective View:

  A kind of historical hubris results from the belief that because we know far more about the consequences of past acts than contemporaneous actors could know, we are more likely than they are to have a correct interpretation of events and of cause and effect. We cannot know the consequences of decisions not made or actions not taken any more than contemporaries did. Nevertheless, time and knowledge of past events provide the historian with a perspective not available to contemporaries. Some historians argue today that TPAJAX was not in the US national interest. Maintaining that American policymakers in the 1950s defined national security narrowly, these historians emphasize that actions intended to enhance American power ultimately have the opposite effect if they violate democratic ideals. In this view, intervening in domestic political processes in foreign countries inevitably undermines US national security by weakening the values on which US security rests in the long run. Specifically, critics of TPAJAX contend that it damaged American national interests for a number of reasons. In their view, it returned the Shah to his throne illegally. The operation removed a popular, legitimately elected Prime Minister from office (who some now claim would have fallen eventually even without American intervention). Finally, American action created a reservoir of resentment among the Iranian people that helped create the conditions for Ayatollah Khomcini's Islamic Revolution in 1978-79.5 In short, what appeared to be a short-term success ultimately proved to be a failure. This critique deserves careful attention; its more thoughtful and articulate proponents appear to make a persuasive case. The Shah did leave Tehnm, to return only when he was certain Mossadeq was gone and American support for the Peacock Throne assured. Mossadeq was popular among some segments of the population. Some Iranians were disillusioned with the United States. They had hoped that the US, as the great postwar anti-colonial power, would not intrigue against their country as the British and Russians had done. A close examination of the facts, however, reveals flaws in the revisionist critique.

  Did the CIA act against a legitimate leader enjoying popular support? Although there is no doubt that Mossadeq captured the imagination of segments of Iranian society with the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, his political support dwindled steadily. By August 1953 he did not command mass support. The Tudeh and splinters of the National Front were the only political parties willing to support him. The pro-Shah sentiments of the Tehran crowds on 19 August 1953 were genuine. Although CIA had a hand in starting the demonstrations, they swelled spontaneously and took on a life of their own that surprised even Kermit Roosevelt. By August 1953, Mossadeq's support was vociferous but increasingly narrow. The Shah's support was latent but deep, and took a crisis—like the news of Tudeh demonstrators pulling down the Shah's statutes—to awaken. Khorramabad residents, for example, wildly rejoiced at hearing of the monarch's return. Before dismissing reports like those from Khorramabad as propaganda, it must be remembered that CIA was able to influence directly events only in the capital city, and there only barely. Kermit Roosevelt had neither the money nor the agents to initiate the kinds of demonstrations that took place in Iran's widely separated cities.

  Did CIA restore the Shah to his throne? TPAJAX did not "restore" the Shah to his throne either technically or constitutionally. Although the Iranian monarch left Tehran during the operation, he never abdicated. Mossadeq's argument that the Shah's firmans were invalid was disingenuous. The Iranian constitution gave the Shah the right to dismiss the Prime Minister. As soon as Mossadeq refused to obey the Shah's legal order, he was rebelling against constitutional authority. From that point on, TPAJAX became an operation to remove the usurper Mossadeq and permit Zahedi, the legitimate Prime Minister, to take office. Unlike Mossadeq's government, Zahedi's government recognized the Shah's constitutional authority.

  Was TPAJAX Responsible for Khomeini's Islamic Revolution? Revisionists contend that CIA stifled Iran's drive to democracy and strengthened the rule of the autocratic Shah, thereby making Khomeini's revolution all but inevitable. Despite its faults, in this view, Mossadeq's Government represented the popular will. His government reflected a vision for Iran's future that the Shah did not share. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi wanted to transform Iran into a modern Westernized state; his people preferred a more traditional society. In removing Mossadeq, the revisionists continue, the United States and Britain effectively strangled traditional Iranian nationalism. Frustrated and resentful, the people rose 25 years later in rage against the Shah and the United States, disparaged as the "Great Satan." For there can be no doubt that despite years of official American and British denials, most Iranians have been convinced of the CIA's role in Mossadeq's fall. A problem with this thesis is that Mossadeq's Iran was not moving toward democracy. The Prime Minister's increasing political isolation and the fragmentation of the National Front, as documented above, had weakened his position and made him desperate. His dictatorial grab for power from the Majlis alienated his former allies and gained him new political enemies. Iran was, to repeat Iran specialist Kuross Samii's apt metaphor, "an old ship swept away by a storm with no one on board capable of dealing with the attendant frenzy." In fact, Khomeini's revolution was a reaction against secularism, modernization, and the Shah's misrule, not a push for a return to the National Front. The streets of Tehran rang with shouts of fanatical support for Khomeini rather than nostalgic calls for Mossadeq. The Ayatollah was not interested in Mossadeq or the things he stood for. The last thing Khomeini wanted was a secular government with multi-party participation. He would have called for fundamentalist revolution against any government, including a National Front or Tudeh Government, that promoted modernization, the emancipation of women, and secularization.

  Edward Shirley, the former CIA DO employee who journeyed through revolutionary Iran, argues that the revisionist thesis also underestimates the role the clerics played in TPAJAX. Without the support of Ayatollahs Kashani and Behbehani, Shirley doubts the covert political action could have succeeded. What the ayatollahs did in 1953 with American and British help, they might have been able to do later without such help. Alternatively, given Mossadeq's growing political weakness and isolation from Iranian society, the clerics may have defeated him and the National Front in general elections. In short, according to Shirley, the 1953 aborted-democracy theory is appealing, but is "too convenient in its diabolization of the CIA and MI6, and too Persian in its determination to make someone else responsible for failure."<sup>[[1]](https://ia600106.us.archive.org/12/items/Zendebad-Shah-Iran-Coup-1953/Zendebad-Shah.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://ia601204.us.archive.org/14/items/TheBattleForIran/The%20Battle%20for%20Iran.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1946-2000, contrary to many pundits, conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists claims—the US Army's School of Americas taught Caribbean, Central and South American countries on sound and relevant military doctrine; promoted democratic values; a respect for civilian government control, and respect for human rights among multinational forces. Every student receives the following human rights training: definition of concepts; the historical development of conventions and declarations; civilian control of the armed forces; the role of those forces in a democracy; and the military advantage for complying with human rights and the Law of Armed Conflict. As part of its internal evaluation process, the SOA requires all students to discuss the effects of human rights instruction in their course critiques. Students are required to describe how SOA instruction in human rights, democratization, civil control of the military, and military justice affected them and how the instruction may have changed any previously held views." All students are screened for criminal and human rights abuses. Countries with poor respect for human rights were prohibited from sending people to SOA.
 
  Several reviews conducted in the 1990s confirm the commendable effort of SOA: A Government Accountability Office report finds SOA training, "is intended to provide a long-term investment in a positive relationship with Latin America. The SOA courses emphasize the protection of human rights." A Board of Visitors report in 1996 found "SOA fulfils a need in providing instruction on civilian control, democratic values and human rights." A TRADOC Task Force report in 1994 finds, "the nomination & selection process of SOA cadre and students is sound. Less than 1 percent of all SOA graduates are alleged to have committed crimes or human rights violations. There is no evidence that indicates that the SOA courses influenced alleged behavior. The SOA program for human rights training is the most comprehensive and well-developed program in the US Army." It goes on, "However, there are cases where a heightened awareness and further scrutiny are needed. These cases occur most often in connection with specific information developed by the Embassy and reported to Washington. Examples include the troubled human rights record of security forces in Indonesia, colombia, and Turkey. In such cases, our assistance to the police and military is carefully vetted with the appropriate bureaus in the State Department to ensure that no training or materiel is provided to units where there is credible evidence they have been involved in the commission of gross violations of human rights. On a few occasions, evidence of gross human rights violations has required a complete reappraisal of U.S. training activities in a specific country. In Indonesia, for example, DoD cancelled the JCET program in May 1998 and has not resumed the program. Currently, U.S. military training with the Indonesian military is limited to a small program of humanitarian, engineering, and medical activities. In addition, a mobile team will provide training in human rights awareness and civil-military relations. There is no training by the U.S military for the Indonesian military in lethal military skills, nor is any contemplated. In the case of Colombia, approval for training activities involves a two-phased screening process by our Embassy's country team. All individuals or units selected to receive training are carefully vetted by the Embassy for criminal, human rights, or narcotics violations. This applies whether the planned training is in-country or in the U.S. Additionally, through a 1997 End-Use Monitoring agreement with the Government of Colombia, indigenous sources of information (e.g., criminal records) are reviewed and then double-checked against U.S. Government records before training is approved. In fact several training activities have recently been cancelled or delayed due to the rigorous screening process at our Embassy."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/soareport)</sup></sup>
  
  As for the Spanish-language training manuals: A 1997 investigation found that a few, short passages (out of 1169 pages in total) in the manuals used between 1987 to 1991 didn't meet DoD standards, should be destroyed. It found that there was no deliberate or orchestrated attempt to violate DoD policy, domestic or international law.<sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/soa-ig-phase-1/mode/2up)</sup></sup> The "questionable" passages are nothing that serious either, even while out of context—here are a few:
  > "Specific individuals, organizations and commercial companies must be the object of infiltration by government employees, in order to obtain information about the guerillas."
  
  > "It is essential that internal intelligence agencies obtain information on the political party or parties that support the insurgent movement, on the influence the insurgent has on them, and on the substance of non-violent attacks the insurgents perpetrate against the government."
  
  > "Insurgents "can be considered criminal by the legitimate government" and are "afraid to be brutalized after capture."
  
  > "All the personal documents to include pocket litter should be carefully examined. . . . The documents that have no military value, such as personal items, should be retained to be given to the prisoner at a later time."
  
  > "To detect and neutralize the insurgents' activities and organizations"<sup>[[3]](https://ia600509.us.archive.org/7/items/USArmySchooloftheAmericasTrainingManuals/US%20Army%20School%20of%20the%20Americas%20Training%20Manuals_text.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup>

- In Peru, between 1995 and 2001, the CIA worked with the Peruvian Government in a counternarcotics operation. In 2001, the Peruvian Air Force accidentally shot down a US plane carrying missionaries. Shortly after the incident, Director Hayden tasked the CIA's Inspector General reviewed the matter: Finding a lapse in procedures and charged that some CIA officers involved attempted to cover it up. This was disputed by a another seperate, independent Agency Accountability Board review, that examined both the IG's report as well as conducting its own investigation. 16 officers were administratively punished after the Board's report was sent to Director Panetta. DOJ concurred with this finding, declining to criminally charge anyone involved. The fault lied mostly with the Peruvian Air Force in failing to adhere to the procedures as they had done so in the past.<sup>[[1]](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/cia-statement-2001-peru-shootdown/story?id=9738624)</sup></sup>

- In 1996, an independent review panel examined all US Government involvement with Guatemala. On CIA's interaction with Guatemalan security services between 1980 and 1996—It also examined the DoD and other US agencies in their relation to counterparts in Guatemala. It concluded:
 "The human rights records of the Guatemalan security services—the D-2 and the Department of Presidential Security (known informally as "Archivos." after one of its predecessor organizations)—were generally known to have been reprehensible by all who were familiar with Guatemala. US policy-makers knew of both CIA's liaison with them and the service's unsavoury reputations. The CIA endeavoured to improve this behavior of the Guatemalan services through frequent and close contact and by stressing the importance of human rights—insisting, for example, that Guatemalan military intelligence training include human rights instruction. The station officers assigned to Guatemala and the CIA headquarters officials whom we interviewed believe that the CIA's contact with the Guatemalan services helped improve attitudes towards human rights. The CIA's Directorate of Operations (DO) and Guatemala station were clearly aware of the potential for human rights violations by assets and liaison contacts. In November 1988, the DO's Latin America (LA) division provided a guidance cable to its Central American stations: "Point we would like to make is that we must all become sensitized to the importance of respecting human rights, and we must ensure that those assets and resource we direct and/or fund are equally sensitive. The issue will only become more important, and we serve our objectives best if we remember that if we ignore the importance of the human rights issue in the final analysis we do a great damage to our mission. We are under great scrutiny. Finally, aside from the legal and policy considerations which are constant in any allegations concerning violations of human rights we also recognize a basic moral obligation. We are Americans and we must reflect American values in the conduct of our business. We are all inherently opposed to the violation of human rights.

   The review also finds: "US policy objectives in Guatemala from 1984 to the present--the period we reviewed--included supporting the transition to and strengthening of civilian democratic government, furthering human rights and the rule of law, supporting economic growth, combating illegal narcotics trafficking, combating the communist insurgency, and advancing the current peace process between the government and the guerrillas...The CIA's successes in Guatemala in conjunction with other US agencies, particularly in uncovering and working to counter coups and in reducing the narcotics flow, were at times dramatic and very much in the national interests of both the United States and Guatemala.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214324/http://www.ciponline.org/iob.htm)</sup></sup>

  The Department of Defense also issued its 1995 Guatemala review. It found that US DoD Policy towards Guatemala was: Promoting a stable democratic government to include ending the Marxist insurgency; eliminating human rights abuses; responding to the economic and social needs of the Guatemalan people; and reducing drugs and drug trafficking.

  Based on the documentation reviewed, all significant DoD programs and activities in Guatemala from 1980 to 1995 were within the stated US Policy objectives: There were 1,366 deployments to Guatemala during the period. Involving at least 25,021 DoD personnel. US military personnel performed humanitarian and civic action exercises designed to demonstrate the role of the military in stabilizing a democratic government and improving the economic and social welfare of the Guatemalan people. Since 1990, DoD personnel have supported the Drug Enforcement Administration's effort to interdict narcotics trafficking in Guatemala by transporting law enforcement personnel, detecting suspected trafficking activity, providing intelligence support and assisting in planning counterdrug operations. The DoD security assistance program during the period totalled 28 million in grant aid and 3.384 million in International Military Education and Training. With the exception of one UH-1 helicopter in 1983, no major end items were provided to the Government of Guatemala.<sup>[[5]](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Sep/11/2001806396/-1/-1/1/REPORT%20TO%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE%20ON%20DOD%20ACTIVITIES%20IN%20GUATEMALA%20(U).PDF)</sup></sup>
  
   A 1986 GAO report examined US arms supply relationship with Guatemala, it finds that, "direct U.S. military assistance was discontinued between fiscal years 1978 and 1984, and commercial sales dropped significantly in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s because of cited human rights violations. Reagan administration officials and documents stated that their arms transfer policy as it concerns human rights conditions is geared toward rewarding improvement rather than trying to coerce improvement by withholding military assistance, which was the Carter administration’s approach."<sup>[[6]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-86-31.pdf)</sup></sup>

A landmark study found, "In contrast, the documentary record indicates that while Kissinger was occasionally informed of what was transpiring in Costa Rica, he was largely disengaged from the handling of the relationship. Nor is there any evidence of US involvement in coup plotting in Costa Rica. To the contrary, rather than humiliate Figueres, the United States restricted its major attempts to influence the Costa Rican president to private discussions."<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14682745.2019.1673372)</sup></sup>

## Iran/Contra
   A lot of myths and conspiracy theories surround this topic. Often, people lump together: The "Iran/Contra affair" (also known as the Iran-Contra matter,) with the crack allegations, with the support to the democratic resistence movement, the Contras. In this subsection, I will address each in order: Context to support the Contras and the efforts to do so, then the affair itself, lastly ending with the drug allegations. This will provide a seemless factual narrative.
   
#### Contra support:

- 1979-1987, Nicaragua/Contras. Years of KGB propaganda have tainted the historical record of the US support to the Contras: Their propaganda was just a projection of Nicaraguan atrocities, such as support to terrorists in surrounding democratic countries—which was on a far larger scale and with greater disregard for human rights—compared to US support to freedom fighters. The primary objective of the Contra program was to persuade Nicaragua to abandon its efforts to engineer the overthrow of neighbouring democratic governments by armed force. The broader US policy and objectives towards Nicaragua were: Holding the implementation of Sandinista commitment to the Orginization of American States to political pluralism, human rights, free elections, non-alignment, and a mixed economy.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/secret-war-in-central-america-and-the-future-of-world-order/0E5915FA4FCD3CAE1328774CF7A540DA)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguavunited0000turn/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/8066report)</sup></sup> It was not to overthrow the brutal regime, which was committing numerous atrocities and human rights abuses.<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguas-military-build-up-and-support-for-central-american-subversion/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://archive.org/details/inside-the-sandinista-regime-a-special-investigators-perspective)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://archive.org/details/sandinista-prisons-a-tool-of-intimidation)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/nicaragua-stolen-revolution-1983)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://archive.org/details/crackdown-on-freedom-in-nicaragua)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754050096308&view=1up&seq=3)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210024350561&view=1up&seq=1https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210024350561&view=1up&seq=1)</sup></sup>

  Corruption started to seep into the Somoza Government during the mid-70s, which led to wide-spread protests and opposition. With the assassination of Somoza's critic, Pedro, this only intensified the opposition, leading even to non-Marxist resistance groups joining with the FSLN, leading to the creation of a Broad Opposition Front. The Front sought to draw people from all economic classes, ages and professions into the anti-Somoza opposition. At this time, the US, in coordination with the Organization of American States (OAS), pressured Somoza to step down, and peacefully transition Government by democratic election. The US provided several options, however Somoza refused them all. In response, the US cut economic and military aid, and pressured other Governments to do the same—thus resulting in his flee from the country. At this time, the Sandinista forces, a small militant minority moved into Managua and assumed power. The leaders of the FSLN had publicly pledged themselves to the principles of political pluralism, a mixed economy, and a non-aligned foreign policy. Since these pledges were thought to reflect the official position of the new Government of National Reconstruction (GRN), it enjoyed broad international support, and the United States took the lead in the assistance effort, providing $118 million of economic aid and humanitarian assistance during the following 18 months. This was more than any other country provided the new regime, and represented more aid than the United States had provided Somoza in the previous four years. European and Latin American countries, notably Venezuela, also rushed aid to impoverished and war-wracked Nicaragua. The aid, provided by PL 96-257, contained a provision, however, that the US would cease economic aid if it the Sandinistas engaged in suppression of human rights, free press, etc. Despite promising free elections, free enterprise, an independent judiciary, and an end to political oppression, the Sandinistas seized television and radio stations, censored La Prensa, and established a Cuban-modeled internal security apparatus. In 1980, the Sandinista Government announced that it would not hold national elections until 1985. This convinced many Nicaraguans that the prospects for a true democracy were growing dimmer under FSLN dominance. In published statements, Sandinista officials expressed their desire for better relations with the United States and insisted that they had no intention of supporting insurgencies aimed at subverting their neighbors. Their actions, however, began to raise additional doubts. Weapons and equipment sent by Cuba through Nicaragua began making their way to rebels in El Salvador. The Sandinista next led the way in militarizing Central America—leading to instability and a rein of terror across the region, all bankrolled by Russia.<sup>[[11]](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/digitallibrary/smof/publicliaison/beserra/oa19286/40-044-12006223-OA19286-001-2019.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/central-america-carter)</sup></sup> <sup>[[13]](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-94/pdf/STATUTE-94-Pg422.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[14]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=626&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[15]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/secret-war-in-central-america-and-the-future-of-world-order/0E5915FA4FCD3CAE1328774CF7A540DA)</sup></sup>
  
  In response to pleas from countries victim to the regime, in 1981, DCI William Casey created the Central America Task Force (CATF) at CIA. A Presidential Finding, signed by President Reagan in December 1981, authorized Agency covert and paramilitary operations, facilitated through friendly governments, against Cuban and Sandinista targets involved in arms trafficking to insurgents in Central America. To ensure CIA's program did not go beyond arms interdiction, Congress enacted an Intelligence Authorization Act in December 1982 that prohibited CIA from supplying money, arms, training, or support to any individual or organization seeking to overthrow the GRN or involved in provoking military confrontations between Nicaragua and Honduras. In September 1983, the Agency was given greater latitude in its relationship with the Contra forces by a new Presidential Finding that changed the objective of Contra support from interdicting arms trafficking to bringing the Sandinistas into peace negotiations. Legislation was enacted in October 1984 that precluded the Agency from providing paramilitary assistance to the Contra forces over the next two years. During this period, the combat effectiveness of the Contra forces declined. NSC staff who were not covered by this legislation, encouraged other states to support the democratic resistance. In October 1986, after considerable debate in Congress, the Agency was authorized to provide paramilitary support to the resistance forces and $100 million was allocated to this purpose for Fiscal Year 1987, beginning in October 1986. The legislation that authorized this assistance contained a provision that barred aid to any group whose members were found to have engaged in "gross violations of internationally recognized human rights... or drug smuggling, or significant misuse of public or private funds.

  Only two Agency field managers engaged in improper activities between September 1985 and February 1987 in connection with assistance to the Contras. The improper activities included assistance in connection with a private benefactor resupply flights, transporting Contra supplied and equipment in Agency helicopters, and other logistical assistance undertaken at a time when such assistance was prohibited by Agency policy or legal guidance. One Agenct field manager autorized his subordinates to engage in these improper activities. The other field manager undertook the activities on his own. There is no evidence in the record, however, that any improper activities were engaged in by the overwhelming majority of Agency employees involved in the Contra program. Moreover, HQS had no knowledge that these activities were taking place. Despite the complexities caused by seven different pieces of legislation dealing with Contra assistance during a five year period, HQS guidance with respect to these statutory restrictions generally was clear and often more conservative than required by the applicable statutes. These two men were fired.<sup>[[16]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP95M00249R000801130011-7.pdf)</sup></sup> No one was convicted for Boland amendment violations.<sup>[[17]](https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/walsh/summpros.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[18]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112071984519&view=2up&seq=40&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[19]](https://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/documents/d-all-19.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
  Sham elections. Some pundits claim that the Sandinistas winning the elections in 1984 legitimised their rule, that is reflected popular support. However, this is both irrelevant, and incorrect. It's irrelevant because the covert program did not, at any time, have the goal to overthrow the regime. Further, the regime promised to hold elections within two years of coming to power—they did not—the covert program stopped in October 1984, and did not resume until October 1986. It is thus impossible to say the US engaged in any effort to overthrow a government, even if it were popular and legitimate. Lastly, the elections themselves were neither free nor fair. The Sandinista National Liberation Front ( FSLN ), which led the military struggle, promised to the people and to the international community that it would promote a pluralistic system in which all sectors of the society could participate freely. Once in power, however, the Sandinistas quickly lost interest in elections, insisting that they were "the vanguard of the people" with a historic right to rule. The Sandinistas concluded that they could use elections as a mechanism to affirm the international legitimacy of the revolution. They anticipated that by persuading the world that their revolution was democratic and popular, they could obtain increased levels of economic aid from the West and intensify political pressure on those who supported groups opposed to the FSLN. However, the Sandinistas ensured that the electoral process could not result in a transfer of power. Acting under a State of Emergency which imposed strict censorship and stifled the activities of other parties, the FSLN enacted laws which guaranteed its control over every aspect of the electoral process. The Sandinistas scheduled elections for November 4, 1984. Seven parties have registered to run the FSLN itself; three other Marxist parties; two parties of the democratic left, one of which is allied with the FSLN; and a faction of the conservative party which has benefited from FSLN assistance. The FSLN has exploited its control of the government (including the police and military), of the media, and of mass organizations to promote its own campaign while obstructing those of the other parties. The largest of the three registered non-Marxist parties withdrew from the elections in protest on October 21, and the others took the same action.

  The mainline democratic opposition parties, allied in the Democratic Coordinating Board (Coordinadora), have refused to register under conditions that they believe do not permit a free and fair election. They repeatedly have called upon the Sandinistas to give the necessary guarantees so that they could compete, but the Sandinistas have rejected their proposals and have refused to negotiate seriously. Instead, Sandinista turbas (mobs) have repeatedly disrupted meetings of the Democratic Coordinating Board, frequently using violence. In calling for an election, however, the comandantes made clear that the process could not result in a transfer of power. Defense Minister Humberto Ortega stressed that the elections would serve only to strengthen the FSLN, and that power would not be " raffled off " as in some lottery. Planning Minister Henry Ruiz, also a member of the FSLN's National Directorate,  reiterated that the purpose of the election was to confirm the leadership of the FSLN, and he explained that the people had a right to pluralism, but with Sandinista hegemony. Junta Coordinator Daniel Ortega Saavedra, also a member of the FSLN's National Directorate, vowed that "neither bullets nor ballots" would ever push the FSLN from power. The elections of 5 November 1984 were held in an atmosphere of political and psychological intimidation. Food was used as a political weapon by the Sandinistas. Because access to government food stores rested with the local Sandinista Defense Committee (CDS), it was widely perceived that not voting would mean not eating. The CDSs played an important role in the period leading up to the election. In the May 1984 secret speech noted earlier, Bayardo Arce said: "We see the elections as one more weapon of the revolution to bring its historical objectives gradually into reality. Therefore, we intend to take advantage of them."<sup>[[20]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014217833&view=2up&seq=6)</sup></sup> <sup>[[21]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=626&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[22]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510029220985&view=2up&seq=2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[23]](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/digitallibrary/smof/publicliaison/beserra/oa19286/40-044-12006223-OA19286-001-2019.pdf)</sup> <sup>[[24]](https://ia902601.us.archive.org/20/items/8066report/8066report.pdf#page=7)</sup></sup> 

  As for the legality on this matter, to quote at length from the ICJ dissenting opinion It's worth noting the dissenting opinion is more than twice as long as the judgement, and revisits the factual and legal record before it, applying far more care. Many in-depth studies have pointed out the severe flaws of the ICJ ruling in its treatment of evidence.<sup>[[25]](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguavunited0000turn/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  "I am profoundly pained to say, I dissent from this judgement because i believe that, in effect, it adopts the false testimony of representatives of the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua on a matter which, in my view, is material to its disposition...The facts are in fundamental controversy. I find the Court's statement of the facts to be inadequate, in that it is sufficiently sets out the facts which have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to the United States, while insufficiently sets out the facts which should have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to Nicaragua. 

  Without any pretence, still less actuality, of provocation, Nicaragua since 1979 has assisted and persisted in efforts to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by providing large-scale, significant and sustained assistance to the rebellion in El Salvador - a rebellion which, before the rendering of Nicaraguan assistance, was ill-organised, ill-equipped and ineffective. The delictual acts of the Nicaraguan Government have not been confined to provision of very large quantities of arms, munitions and supplies; Nicaragua (and Cuba) have joined with the Salvadoran rebels in the organisation, planning and training for their acts of insurgency; and Nicaragua has provided the Salvadoran insurgents with command-and-control facilities, bases, communications and sanctuary, which have enabled the leadership of the Salvadoran insurgency to operate from Nicaraguan territory. Under both customary and conventional international law, that scale of Nicaraguan subserve activity not only constitutes unlawful intervention in the affairs of El Salvador; it is cumulatively tantamount to an armed attack upon El Salvador."
  
  "Not only is El Salvador entitled to defend itself against this armed attack; it can, and has, called upon the United States to assist it in the exercise of collective self-defense. The United States is legally entitled to respond. It can lawfully respond to Nicaragua's covert attempt to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by overt or covert pressures, military and other, upon the Government of Nicaragua, which are exerted either directly upon the Government, territory and people of Nicaragua by the United States, or indirectly through the actions of Nicaraguan rebels - the "contras" - supported by the United States."<sup>[[26]](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/70/070-19860627-JUD-01-09-EN.pdf)</sup></sup> 

  On Contra's alleged atrocities. Contrary to historical revisionists claims, the Contras never condoned nor sanctioned human rights abuses or atrocities, as the Sandinista regime did. However, yes, there were a few atrocities committed by members of the Contras. Upon thorough investigation, and judicial finding, several were executed, exiled, or other such punishments. Many reports from HRW, Brody, Americas Watch, etc. Have been thoroughly investigated, and found to be severely lacking in credibility. Though, few cases were verified. Often, these organisations were merely regurgitate Sandinista disinformation, that was already debunked at the time.<sup>[[27]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T01058R000100170001-7.pdf)</sup></sup> 

  As for the "guerilla manual," it is largely exaggerated by pundits. The CIA learned of a draft manual created by non-Americans in late Spring, 1983. CIA found the manual to be totally unacceptable, because it called for widespread use of indiscriminate violence. US personnel urged the draft manual never be used, and all copies of it destroyed. This, however, prompted CIA to make a code of conduct and training material, to assure FDN fighters going into villages, how to deal with locals, in a manner consistent with FDN's democratic objectives—The code of conduct book, known as the blue book. Every FDN soldier carried one. It explains that the objective of the FDN is the development of a democratic and pluralistic government in Nicaragua, to establish social justice and human rights, to restore the freedoms violated by the Sandinistas, and to achieve economic reform and greater social mobility. At FDN request, a manual was created for Psychological operations, as guidance. Context is critical. It notes that every combatant is highly motivated to engage in propaganda. It explains how they can counter, and win hearts and minds, such as, avoid violence as much as possible.<sup>[[28]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170215021829/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86B00269R001500230003-7.pdf)</sup></sup> A plain reading of the manual, as Sen. Malcolm Wallop put it, "taken as a whole, the manual calls for the avoidance of violence to the extent possible and was designed to put restraint and a rationale on guerrilla operations as a whole, the manual is a code of conduct for which the United States ought not to be ashamed." After press reporting, two investigations followed: One by CIA's Independent Inspector General; one by the President's Intelligence Oversight Board. All concluded the purpose of the manual was to moderate freedom fighters in their struggle against a brutal regime, and how to win support of the people. However, due to poor translation by the contractor who made the document, a few words were misinterpreted, such as "neutralized".<sup>[[29]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90B01370R001501940018-3.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[30]](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/statement-principal-deputy-press-secretary-speakes-central-intelligence-agency)</sup></sup> 

#### Iran/Contra affair:
- Contra funding during the Congressional restrictions never drove the Iran initiative. The use of residuals to benefit the Contras was certainly seen as a plus—a "neat idea"—by North and Poindexter. A sober look at the amount of money involved would make that clear to anyone. At most, the residuals were seen as a peripheral benefit. Moreover, the decision not to notify Congress was not based on an anti-democratic obsession with secrecy., but was based on the same sound reasoning that led the Carter administration to the identical decision not to report operations during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979 and 1980. Leaks. In all, only 204 TOW missiles, 18 HAWKs, and 200 HAWK battery spare parts were sold.<sup>[[31]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2702452/Iran-Contra-Minority-Report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[32]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220623074901/http://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-turner.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[33]](https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1701&context=plr)</sup></sup> <sup>[[34]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220623074904/http://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-bruemmer-silverberg.pdf)</sup></sup>

#### Drug allegations:
- The CIA had no involvement drug trafficking, as alleged by Gary Webb. Several independent investigations could not substantiate the claims and found contradictory information to said allegations, such as when CIA learned of such illegal activities, they tipped off local Law Enforcement to take action. Indeed, the Mercury News backed away from Webb’s scoop. The paper transferred him to its Cupertino bureau and did an internal review of his facts and his methods. Jerry Ceppos, the Mercury News’s executive editor, wrote a piece concluding that the story did not meet the newspaper’s standards.

  The independent investigations include: Other media outlets, CIA's Inspector General; DOJ's Inspector General; Joint Committee on Contra; the Select Committee on Narc abuse; Crime subcommittee; Foreign Relations Committee; FBI; Special Counsel and lastly the 2000 House Intel Committee, which reviewed all prior investigations, and conducted its own, finding: "Based on its investigation, involving numerous interviews, reviews of extensive documentation, and a thorough and critical reading of other investigative reports, the Committee has concluded that the evidence does not support the implications of the San Jose Mercury News—that the CIA was responsible for the crack epidemic in Los Angeles or anywhere else in the United States to further the cause of the Contra war in Central America."
  
  From the Joint Committee, "Our investigation has not developed any corroboration of media-exploited allegations that U.S. government-condoned drug trafficking by Contra leaders or Contra organizations or that Contra leaders or organizations did in fact take part in such activity. During the course of our investigation, we examined files of State, DoD, NSC, CIA, DEA, Justice, Customs and FBI, especially those reportedly involving newspaper allegations of Contra drug trafficking... During the course of our investigation, the role of U.S. government officials who supported the Contras' and the private resupply effort, as well as the role of private individuals in resupply, were exhaustively examined. Hundreds of persons, including U.S. government employees, Contra leaders, representatives of foreign governments, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials, military personnel, private pilots and crews involved in actual operations were questioned and their files and records examined. Despite numerous newspaper accounts to the contrary, no evidence was developed indicating that Contra leadership or Contra organizations were actually involved in drug trafficking. Sources of news stories indicating to the contrary were of doubtful veracity. There was no information developed indicating any U.S. government agency or organization condoned drug trafficking by the Contras or anyone else.
  
  We have discovered that almost all of these allegations originate from persons indicted or convicted of drug smuggling. Justice has stated that such persons are more and more claiming, as a defense, that they were smuggling for the benefit of the Contras in what they believed was a U.S. government sponsored operation. Typically, they furnish no information which can be corroborated by investigation. In addition to the above-mentioned negative file reviews, interviews with employees of these U.S. agencies have also been negative. Contra leaders have been interviewed and their bank records examined. They denied any connection with or knowledge of drug trafficking. Examination of Contra financial records, private enterprise business records and income tax returns of several individuals failed to locate any indication of drug trafficking." An investigator involved in this examination, a retired FBI Special Agent, reiterates this point and says that "the [Certified Public Accountants] who were charged with auditing the Contra bank accounts found no evidence of influxes of cash attributed to drugs" He says the bank accounts examined included the Contra organization's bank accounts in the Bank of Commerce and Credit International, and personal bank accounts. According to the investigator, the sources of all the money in these accounts were accounted for and much came from third country contributors."
  
  From March 2, 1982 to August 3, 1995, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Attorney General & the DCI under Executive Order 12333 governed reporting of potential crimes. That MOU continued to require CIA to report to DOJ possible violations of "any" federal laws-again thereby including narcotics laws-by CIA employees. However, because of a change in the definition of "employee," agents, assets and independent contractors were moved to the non-employee category and thereby subject to a list of reportable offenses that did not include narcotics violations. The MOU provided that CIA would continue to have the discretion to report any offense by a non-employee to DOJ in addition to the potential crimes that were specified in the MOU. A February 11, 1982 letter from Attorney General William French Smith to DCI William Casey that accompanied the MOU noted that the MOU contained no formal requirement regarding the reporting of narcotics violations by non-employees and urged the CIA's continuing cooperation with DOJ and the Drug Enforcement Administration. This letter did not, however, establish a legal requirement that the CIA report potential narcotics violations by non-employees because no such requirement was included in the MOU. There was no CIA-wide regulation explaining the crimes reporting responsibilities of CIA employees under E.O. 12333 & the DOJ-CIA MOU until December 23, 1987. In August 1995, the 1982 DOJ-CIA Crimes Reporting MOU was revised. Under the revised MOU, assets and independent contractors were again considered "employees" for crimes reporting purposes. Further, narcotics violations were included among the list of "non-employee" crimes that must be reported to the DOJ. A February 8, 1985 internal DOJ memo stated explicitly that there was no requirement for CIA to report non-employee narcotics violations & suggested that the MOU would have to be renegotiated in order to include narcotics violations by non-employees as reportable crimes. 
  
  The Committee concurs with the assessment of the CIA IG that the CIA regulations and policies in effect during the existence of the Contra program did not adequately address the range of drug trafficking matters facing CIA managers and personnel serving in Central America in the 1979-1990 period. With respect to the Contra program, the CIA's regulations and policies did not provide sufficient guidance or procedures for reporting and investigating narcotics trafficking matters: The CIA had no regulations or policies regarding the CIA's responsibilities to identify and pursue allegations or information indicating that organizations or individuals were involved in drug trafficking;  The CIA had no published regulations or policies that addressed CIA employees' contacts with individuals or companies that were known or suspected to have been involved in drug trafficking, unless they were part of a counternarcotics operation or program; and the CIA had no regulations or policies that required that information be requested from DEA, the Customs Service, or U.S. Government law enforcement agencies, other than the FBI, regarding individuals or entities about whom the CIA had knowledge of drug allegations or drug-related information. This led the SSCI to also find, "CIA reporting to DOJ of information on Contra involvement in narcotics trafficking was inconsistent but in compliance with then-current policies and regulations. There is no evidence, however, that CIA officers in the field or at headquarters ever concealed narcotics trafficking information or allegations involving the Contras."
  
  In interviews with CIA managers and field officers who served in the Contra program, the Committee found that the unwritten policy appears to have been that the CIA should have no official or unofficial relationship with individuals associated with narcotics trafficking. Despite the lack of CIA written regulations or policies on the reporting of drug trafficking allegations, these CIA managers and field officers consistently indicated that such allegations—when they arose-were reported from the field to CIA's OGC where a decision was presumably made about whether to provide the information to DOJ for investigation. These CIA managers and field officers uniformly noted that any actual links between the Contra program and narcotics trafficking would destroy the program's political support. Several senior CIA managers could recollect only a single instance of a report of narco-trafficking by Contra officials during the term of the Contra assistance program.
  
  Conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists will often quote wiki which in turn, misleadingly quotes the IG investigations, as to suggest CIA involvement. There are 3 quotes, the first: "In the 623rd paragraph, the report described a cable from the CIA's Directorate of Operations dated October 22, 1982, describing a prospective meeting between Contra leaders in Costa Rica for "an exchange in [the United States] of narcotics for arms, which then are shipped to Nicaragua." However, Volume 2 of the CIA IG report goes on to say "No information has been found to indicate whether a meeting in fact took place in Costa Rica to discuss an exchange of narcotics for arms as described in the October 1982 cable. However, a November 1982 Headquarters cable discussed the alleged meeting and stated: It is HQS opinion that much of information contained in (the October 1982 and November 1982 cables) simply does not make sense (i.e., UDN/FDN cooperation, need to obtain armament through illegal means, shipment of arms to Nicaragua, involvement with the (specific U.S.- based religious organization]). We see a distinct possibility that the (INS) source was either intentionally or unintentionally misinformed." The second misleading quote, "The report stated that the CIA had requested the Justice Department return $36,800 to a member of the Meneses drug ring, which had been seized by DEA agents in the Frogman raid in San Francisco. The CIA's Inspector General said the Agency wanted the money returned "to protect an operational equity, i.e., a Contra support group in which it [CIA] had an operational interest." However, this ignores the next sentence, "However, the prosecutors state that the decision to return Zavala's money was based on other considerations, not CIA's representations, and that there was no evidentiary value to retaining the money. In any event, the actions taken by CIA to have the cash returned did not appear to be intended to influence the outcome of Zavala's trial, which resulted in his conviction."
  
  The DOJ and CIA Inspectors General refute the allegations that Julio was a CIA asset, and supported the Contras. They also refute the allegation CIA intervened in his case. DOJ IG, "In 1982, a federal OCDETF task force targeted a drug trafficking organization in San Francisco. After a lengthy investigation, which included extensive wiretaps, the federal authorities arrested over 50 defendants and seized 555 pounds of cocaine. The case became known as the "Frogman Case," because some of the defendants were arrested in wetsuits while bringing cocaine ashore from a Colombian vessel in San Francisco Bay. Among the defendants later arrested in this case were Julio Zavala and Carlos Cabezas. At the time of Zavala's arrest, approximately $36,000 was seized from Zavala's residence. Prior to trial, defense counsel filed a motion seeking depositions in Costa Rica to show that the money seized from Zavala was not the proceeds of drug trafficking but had been given to Zavala by the Contras. Along with his motion, defense counsel submitted documents from two individuals who claimed they were Contra officials in Costa Rica and had given Zavala $45,000 to "promote the reinstatement of democracy in Nicaragua" within the United States. The court granted Zavala's counsel permission to take the depositions of individuals in Costa Rica to explore the source of the money.
  
  After the court's ruling, the San Francisco Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) handling the case took steps to initiate travel to Costa Rica to take the depositions of the two Contra leaders. Through the State Department, the Costa Rica CIA Station learned about the proposed depositions. The Station mistakenly believed that one of the persons to be deposed was a former CIA asset, not the Contra leader who was identified in the document filed by defense counsel. As a result, an attorney in the CIA General Counsel's office met with the AUSA handling the case in San Francisco, after which the depositions were canceled and the money returned to Zavala. Finally, it was difficult to determine whether the money actually belonged to the Contras or was Zavala's drug proceeds. We concluded, based on the available albeit conflicting evidence, that Zavala or persons acting on his behalf fabricated the claim that it was Contra money rather than proceeds from drug trafficking. We concluded that Zavala engaged in a ploy to salvage some of his drug profits, and the strategy succeeded. At bottom, the allegations of United States government involvement in the drug trafficking of Zavala were clearly a defense tactic and were not based on any credible evidence. Iversen himself described the allegations of outrageous government misconduct as the "theatrical" aspect of the case."
  
  As the AUSA noted in a letter-to-the-editor, "We did return $ 36,000 to Zavala. It had nothing to do with any claim that the funds came from the contras or belonged to the contras. It had to do with the fact that it would have cost the taxpayers who were expected by the Court to pay for all travel by all counsel at least that much to fund the excursion to Costa Rica to take the necessary depositions for the problematical result we might be permitted to keep the seized funds. It made no economic sense to me to do this. No " higher ups " were involved, as Congresswoman Boxer wrongfully surmises. The U.S. Attorney had the authority then to compromise claims up to a $ 100,000 ceiling and I exercised that authority. The authority has since been increased to $ 200,000.  While $ 36,000 may seem like a significant sum and people might disagree with our decision to return it, against the background that the cocaine seized had a value of $ 100 million and that we have millions of dollars in property and currency subject to forfeiture in this district at any given time ($20 million at present ) and that little was to be gained from expending valuable agent and attorney time in further quest of what were by comparison "nickels and dimes, " the decision was reasonable, justifiable and I make no apology for having made it."
  
   CIA's IG, on the question, "Did any of the individuals who were arrested in 'The Frogman Case' have any relationship with CIA? Were the drug trafficking activities of any of those individuals linked to the Contras?" To which the IG found, "No information has been found to indicate that CIA or individuals acting on behalf of CIA had any relationship with Julio Zavala , Carlos Cabezas, or others who were arrested or charged in connection with the Frogman Case. No information has been found to indicate that Julio Zavala, Carlos Cabezas or other Frogman Case defendants were connected to the Contras or that the Contras benefited from their drug trafficking activities. No information has been found to support Cabezas' claim that he provided financial assistance to the Contras from his drug trafficking activities. While two individuals who were active in the Contra movement wrote letters indicating that the money seized from Zavala belonged to the Contras, it appears this was done through Zavala's wife's connections with old family friends and not because Zavala was active in the Contra movement."
   
   The last misleading quote found in the wiki article, "The report also stated that former DEA agent Celerino Castillo alleged that during the 1980s, Ilopango Airport in El Salvador was used by Contras for drug smuggling flights, and "his attempts to investigate Contra drug smuggling were stymied by DEA management, the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, and the CIA." Much to the dismay of the conspiracy theorists—none of the allegations were substantiated. Castillo's source denies ever making such claims. Per the DOJ IG report, "The OIG found it difficult to evaluate Castillo's allegations because of their general nature, the passage of time, the refusal by some witnesses to be interviewed, and Castillo's refusal to be interviewed by the OIG except under unacceptable conditions. We nevertheless gathered information relevant to his claims from a number of sources, interviewed many persons connected to the allegations, and reviewed documents from DEA and CIA files related to his claims. We concluded that while some of Castillo's factual allegations had a seed of truth, the inferences he drew from these facts and his broad claims about a conspiracy by the CIA and the Contras concerning drug trafficking were not supported. We found that, in 1986, Castillo did pass intelligence information to DEA Headquarters suggesting that some private pilots who used Ilopango Airport to supply the Contras may have been trafficking in drugs. Sensitive covert operations regarding the supply of the Contras were also being conducted at the same time from Ilopango Airport, and Castillo's investigation of drug trafficking at Ilopango was closed.
   
   Despite the existence of these facts, we did not corroborate Castillo's broad conclusions, particularly that the CIA and the Contras were involved in a conspiracy to smuggle drugs and to obstruct his investigation. The DEA did not have hard evidence to substantiate the charges about drug trafficking at Ilopango, and Castillo's own report about the matter stated that the U.S. Ambassador in El Salvador had permitted Castillo to investigate the claims about Ilopango, but requested that the investigation be discreet. While the CIA and the Embassy were undoubtedly uneasy about a DEA investigation at the airport, we did not find proof that it was because the CIA was involved with or knew about drug trafficking at the airport found that part of the government was not anxious to have DEA agent Castillo openly probe the activities at Ilopango Airport because of sensitive covert operations there. Our assessment of Castillo's allegations was similar to that of a number of his DEA colleagues in Central America, as well as the FBI agent who interviewed him in connection with the Iran-Contra Office of Independent Counsel investigation: Castillo was quick to jump to conclusions based on limited knowledge and little hard evidence, and the evidence Castillo did advance did not corroborate his broad assertions. Castillo's list of relevant files did not support his broad claims of Contra and CIA ties to drug trafficking, and the individuals we contacted about him, including his colleagues in Guatemala, also did not corroborate his claims. Several of his colleagues confirmed that Castillo has a tendency to make allegations without adequate evidence; some have stated that they did not find him to be trustworthy in his claims. But our conclusions about Castillo's allegations do not rely upon general impressions about his credibility. Rather, although some of his claims have a seed of truth behind them, the inferences he draws, and his core claims about CIA support for Contra drug trafficking, were not substantiated by our review." Further, "Foster said that he did not think that Castillo was a credible witness because, after setting out his own limited direct knowledge, he would proceed to make generalizations that people "had to have known" that other people had drug involvement. This assessment by Foster to us was consistent with his evaluation of Castillo at the time of the 1991 interview. Foster wrote then, after the interview, that in his view Castillo made snap judgments which often were not substantiated. Foster explained in his report: For example, everyone he sees in El Salvador and can't explain is automatically lumped into a group of covert operatives involved in every kind of secretive or illegal activity. He claims everyone knows everything, but he can't articulate it. He makes general accusations, but when I try to pin him down, he can't provide specific information that would support his conclusions."<sup>[[35]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112071984519&view=2up&seq=1&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[36]](https://ia904603.us.archive.org/14/items/reportofcongress87unit/reportofcongress87unit.pdf#page=655)</sup></sup> <sup>[[37]](https://archive.org/details/WatersCIAContraReportExcerpt/_Waters_CIAContraReportExcerpt/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[[38]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/9712/exec.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[39]](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-10-21-mn-59232-story.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[40]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112071984527&view=2up&seq=1)</sup></sup> <sup>[[41]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/9712/exsump3.htm#X.)</sup></sup> <sup>[[42]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/9712/exsump2.htm#VIII.)</sup></sup> <sup>[[43]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/9712/exsump1.htm#IV.)</sup></sup>

  It has also been alleged since the 80s, and still persists to this day thanks to movies like 'American Made', that CIA used Mena airport, Arkansas, to do drug smuggling with Barry Seal. This was also refuted by an independent investigation: "Adler Berriman "Barry" Seal was never employed by CIA in any capacity. The only limited contact any CIA personnel had with Seal was during a two-day period in 1984 when Seal was involved in a Drug Enforcement Agency string operation that subsequently implicated a Nicaraguan Government official and members of the Medellin drug cartel in a conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the United States. CIA provided technical support to this operation which involved the installation of two 35mm cameras into a C-123K airplane that Seal used during the operation. CIA personnel discussed with Seal options for installing cameras in the aircraft, and instructed him on the methods of operating the cameras. Other CIA personnel who were present had passing or otherwise brief discussions with Seal. During the course of these discussions, Seal was escorted by DEA personnel. No evidence has been found to indicate that CIA knew Seal's true identity prior to the operation or that its personnel had any other contact with Seal before or after this 1984 operation."<sup>[[44]](https://archive.org/details/cia-mena-report)</sup></sup>

   No US officials were charged, or convicted, for the drug allegations—because, as shown: The allegations were unfounded.<sup>[[45]](https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/walsh/summpros.htm)</sup></sup>
   
   Despite the conspiracy theories, Garry Webb did indeed commit suicide. No, there was not "two shots to the back of the head". The shots were near his ear, from the side. One bullet missed and went through the cheek due to uncontrolled shaking, the last finished it. Further, yes, it is possible to have two gunshot wounds to the head in suicide. These have been documented long-before Webb's death, and many, many since. Aside from forensic evidence proving it was suicide, His ex-wife at the time also confirmed it would have been suicide, "The way he was acting it would be hard for me to believe it was anything but suicide," she said. According to her, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.<sup>[[46]](https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/gary-webbs-death-confirmed-as-suicide,109995)</sup></sup> <sup>[[47]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004140050065)</sup></sup> <sup>[[48]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12780)</sup></sup> <sup>[[49]](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-mar-16-et-webb16-story.html)</sup></sup>
   
- Conspiracy theorists allege that the CIA was connected to the Cubana de Aviación Flight 455 bombing, on 6 October 1976. Only 2 of the 4 responsible had past contacts with the CIA. Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch Avila. The USG had no foreknowledge of the incident.

  Posada arrived in the U.S. in February 1961 as a political refugee. Soon after his arrival, Posada joined the 2506 Brigade and received paramilitary training in Guatemala under CIA auspices in preparation for the Bay of Pigs invasion. Posada probably received at least rudimentary familiarization training in demolitions in the Guatemala camp. From March 1963 to March 1964 Posada was in the U.S. Army at Fort Benning, Georgia, finishing up as a Second Lieutenant and Commanding Officer of a Weapons Platoon in a Ranger Battalion. In the latter function Posada would very likely have received demolitions training. In March 1965 Posada was recruited by CIA to serve as a Maritime Training Branch instructor in Florida. His file indicates that he was reported to be a "demolitions expert" (at the time of his hiring in March 1965). Posada was also utilized as a source on Cuban exile activities. In 1965 Posada was involved with Luis Sierra Lopez who was working with Roberto Alejos Arzu, a Guatemalan citizen who was attempting to overthrow the Guatemalan Government. Posada was of interest to the Sierra/Alejos group because of his knowledge of demolitions and weapons. Posada reported fully to CIA, and later to the FBI, on his involvement in and the activities of this group (and subsequent other Cuban exile activist organizations with which he became affiliated). As of August 1966 Posada was used solely as an informant on the activities of the Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE), a Miami-based Cuban exile group. He was formally terminated in July l967. In August 1967 Posada moved to Caracas, Venezuela and secured a position with DIGEPOL, the Venezuelan security service (now known as DISIP). He was formally terminated on 30 June 1974. Infrequent contact was maintained with Posada, however, until February 1976 because of certain out-standing U.S. Federal Income Tax problems Posada had because of his (then) status as a Permanent Resident Alien (PRA) of the U.S. In mid-February 1976, Posada recontacted to volunteer a report on the whereabouts Orlando Bosch Avila, Frank Castro, and on a threat to the life of Salvador Allende's nephew. The final contact between the Agency and Posada occurred on 22 June 1976 when Posada contacted to request visa assistance for his wife and himself; the assistance was denied.
  
  Orlando Bosch Avila is a well-known Cuban exile activist who is subject to arrest upon re—entry to the U.S. as a parole violator. The Agency was in contact with Bosch in Miami from approximately January to November 1962. Bosch was under consideration as an "external coordinator" in the Evelio Duque exile group. Bosch was to assist the Agency and Duque in formulating operational plans for infiltration (into Cuba) teams. Bosch did obtain safehouses and procured food supplies for the Duque teams, and assisted Duque in drafting operational plans for the infiltration teams. Available information in Bosch's file does not indicate any Agency contact with Bosch subsequent to November 1962 for this purpose. Later, on 31 October and l November 1963, a representative of the Agency met with Bosch in New York City twice. These two meetings were in connection with efforts by Bosch to secure financial support for air strikes (mounted from Central America) against Cuba. Bosch at this time was the General Coordinator of the Insurrectional Movement of Revolutionary Recovery (MIRR). Bosch was informed through an intermediary on either 2 or 3 November 1963 that no financial support would be forthcoming. There is no available information in Bosch's file that indicates any Agency contact with Bosch subsequent to 1 November 1963.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/BACKGROUND%20INFORMATION%20ON%5B15926778%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  It should be noted that: Bosch was tried by a Venezuelan military tribunal in 1980 and acquitted due to a lack of evidence. He was tried in civil proceedings in 1986 and acquitted. due to insufficicnt evidence. Bosch spent I0 years in prison during proceedings. In 1987, a Venezuelan higher court upheld Bosch's acquittal and he was released. As of April 1992, Bosch was living in Miami under restricted parole (for crimes committed in the US). Posada Carriles escaped from Venezuelan prison before he could be tried. US had no information on his whereabouts in 1992.<sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/BACKGROUND%20INFORMATION%20ON%5B15926778%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- It was alleged that the CIA, in El Salvador, supported right-wing death squads, and encouraged security service abuses—during hostilities between Salvadoran security forces, right-wing groups and left-wing terrorists. This has been a thoroughly debunked USSR hoax, to cover the USSR's support for left-wing death squads and terrorists. Indeed, 3 seperate, independent investigations concluded as much: The House Intel Committee; the Senate Intel Committee and the Inspector General. US pressure, public and private, saw success at moderating security services, the military, police, and overall civic affairs. During the free and fair election of Duarte, a number of reforms took place, most important was judicial. From the House Intel Committee, "The staff's investigation looked at press reports and materials from private organizations alleging a range of US intelligence activities with reference to death squads. These allegations can be summarized as follows: 1) That US intelligence trained, organized, financed and advised Salvadoran security forces that engaged in death squad activities; 2) That US intelligence was aware of torture and killing by Salvadoran security services and death squads, and in some cases participated in such killings.

  The Committee staff conducted a comprehensive review aimed at providing as much information as could be gathered bearing on these allegations. It reviewed intelligence reporting on death squads as well as the intelligence tasking which established priorities for intelligence collection. The Staff examined all intelligence reporting bearing on death squads from 1979 to present. It reviewed State Department cables bearing on the same subject. The staff conducted interviews with numerous intelligence officials knowledgable about intelligence activities in El Salvador from 1979 to 1984. The staff also reviewed in detail a CIA Inspector General report requested by the Committee in connection with H. Res.467. This report reviewed CIA operational relationships that might have involved members of death squads. Finally, the staff made additional requests for information. The staff review of operational intelligence relationships leads it to conclude that US intelligence agencies have not conducted any of their activities in such a way as to directly encourage or support death squad activities. To the contrary, US intelligence activities have been directed, sometimes successfully, at countering death squad activity, reducing the power of individuals connected with death squads, and seeking their removal from positions of authority.
  
  The staff has uncovered no evidence that US intelligence officials or US intelligence policy in any way encouraged torture by Salvadoran security service or by any death squads. To the Contrary, all that the staff can discover indicates US intelligence efforts to moderate the behavior of Salvadoran security service and armed forces personnel to prevent such activities. Further, as the US has learned more about death squad activity, and as it has concentrated more policy attention on this subject, some improvements have taken place. The staff points in this regard to the exile from El Salvador of certain officials identified by the United States as having death Squad connections."

  Further, under continued US pressure, via the Military and diplomacy efforts, the respect for human rights in El Salvador increased dramatically. Though, there were a few reports that tried to suggest that human rights improvements had not occurred, they have been discredited.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/death-squad-investigation)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1279408/soviet-support-for-international-terrorism-and.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/98659.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=530&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00589R000100040004-9.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754074682596&view=1up&seq=63&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/el-salvador-report)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-91-166.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://library.brown.edu/create/modernlatinamerica/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2013/08/Special-Report-on-Communist-Interference-in-El-Salvador.pdf)</sup></sup>

  An independent 1993 panel examined US State Department and Foreign Service handling of human rights issues involving El Salvador from 1980 to 1991. The Panel reviewed the public and State Department record, including classified documents. It interviewed over 70 individuals, inside and outside the Department, who were directly involved. It convened a public hearing and heard testimony from 25 witnesses. It paid particular attention to nine of the most egregious cases of human rights abuse reported by the United Nations Truth Commission in March 1993. The Panel's basic conclusion is that, within the parameters of overall U.S. policy, the Department and Foreign Service personnel performed creditably—and on occasion with personal bravery—in advancing human rights in El Salvador: (1) Ambassadors consistently pushed their staffs to prepare honest, detailed human rights reports for Washington concerning specific abuses and the overall situation. (2) Reporting officers pursued cases aggressively, and the Embassy put steady pressure on the Salvadoran government and military to bring perpetrators to justice. (3) Enormous effort was expended, and modest progress achieved, in developing El Salvador's institutional capacity to deter and punish human rights abusers. A formal instruction from Secretary Shultz to his ambassador in El Salvador in mid-decade put the matter succinctly: In order to ensure El Salvador's security and stability in the short and long term, it was necessary to have “not only a high level of support against the current guerrilla threat, but also assistance in building and consolidating institutions which will lead to Salvadoran national reunification, more peaceful and representative political and judicial processes, and economic development." A specific goal was to “continue to strengthen El Salvador's moderate political center and to promote further development of representative democratic institutions and full respect for human rights."

  Strong underlying forces ensured that the promotion of human rights would be a critical element of U.S. policy toward El Salvador despite the changes in rhetoric. First, there was an assumption in the State Department that the Salvadoran government and society had to reform and develop a friendly, stable government supported by its people or there would be no hope to avoid an FMLN takeover. Without reform, military aid would be wasted. Second, without improvements in the barbaric human rights practices in El Salvador, support in the United States for aid to that government would collapse. Pressures from Congress, the American public, and interests groups made progress on human rights issues key to continued U.S. assistance. Third, the Foreign Service reflects the nation it serves: human rights are an integral part of what we stand for as a nation and by the 1980s had become an accepted part of the American diplomatic agenda. Fourth, there were legal requirements to prepare the annual Human Rights reports, certifications of Salvadoran human rights performance, etc. As one former Assistant Secretary summed it up for the Panel: “There was no way to sustain our policy toward El Salvador without an aggressive approach on human rights. It was essential morally and politically." The files contain reports of sustained efforts by U.S. ambassadors in San Salvador and other members of the Administration to pressure the Salvadoran government and military to improve their record on human rights throughout the period. There is nothing in the record to suggest official indifference on this issue. U.S. ambassadors in San Salvador pressed their message firmly throughout the period that U.S. support for El Salvador was unsustainable if the human rights violations continued. Most did so publicly, as well as in private. The techniques applied included trips to the country by Vice Presidents Bush and Quayle and visits by many senior Washington officials, statements by U.S. leaders to Salvadoran visitors, numerous general and specific démarches by U.S. ambassadors, and continuing efforts by members of the Embassy to get results on specific cases of human rights abuses.

  The most dramatically successful of these efforts was the trip by Vice President Bush in December 1983. His message to assembled officials and military leaders was blunt: stop the death squads or the President and I will lead the charge in stopping aid to El Salvador. His entourage provided a list of leading military figures who had to be moved out of command positions if U.S. aid were to continue. The State Department and the Embassy felt that the best approach to managing the Salvadoran problem was to build a civil society with appropriate institutions that could develop links between the government and the people and provide the basis for progress in human rights and other areas. Current and former officials whom the Panel interviewed held that Saivadoran society in the early eighties had become so polarized that the only hope for the country's future stability was to build a political center. The military had been running the country for a long time and had contempt—sometimes justified—for the corruption of the civilian governmental structure. The constraints on the civilian leadership's power were readily observable. The Embassy, therefore, worked closely with Presidents Duarte, Magana, and Cristiani to devise ways to increase the power of civilian authorities in the country and encouraged military leaders to accede to this change. It strongly supported elections to pull political forces from the extremes to the center and give the winners the legitimacy necessary to govern. It sought to professionalize the army and inculcate more humane values in its ranks. The U.S. Government also worked hard to create an improved security and judicial system. The judiciary, however, was badly intimidated and shied away from any action on controversial cases.

  The U.S. made a conscious decision to work through existing organizations both to increase their experience and prestige and to ensure the reforms had a "made in El Salvador" tag so they would last. As Assistant Secretary Enders told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early 1982, the Department believed that, though the judicial system was “very largely inoperative," the investigation of prominent cases had to be carried out within the Salvadoran system if it were ever to begin fulfilling its proper functions. He added that, "We are asking them not only for justice, we are asking them to make the judicial system work, because it is an essential ingredient of human rights in any country."

  A sweep by the Atlacatl Battalion through the town of El Mozote and the surrounding area in December 1981 became a cause célébre when a massacre of Civilians there was reported in late January in the New York Times and the Washington Post. Embassy San Salvador was skeptical of the report (it was publicized the day before President Reagan issued a required certification that the human rights situation in El Salvador was improving). The January 27 stories prompted the Embassy to carry out its own investigation. It sent the assistant defense attaché and a human rights officer to the area. They were unable to get to the site—which had returned to rebel control—but they flew over it by helicopter and talked to people in the vicinity. The Embassy reported its conclusions in a cable dated January 31. The summary stated: “Although it is not possible to prove or disprove excesses of violence against the civilian population of El Mozote by government troops, it is certain that the guerrilla forces who established defensive positions in El Mozote did nothing to remove them from the path of battle which they were aware was coming and had prepared for, nor is there any evidence that those who remained attempted to leave. Civilians did die during Operation Rescate but no evidence could be found to confirm that government forces systematically massacred Civilians in the operation zone, nor that the number of civilians killed even remotely approached number being cited in other reports circulating internationally." It noted they were still pursuing the question of what army units were present in El Mozote. The reporting officers quoted an aged couple who fled the town during the attack as saying they saw dozens of bodies. The mayor of a nearby town was unwilling to discuss the comportment of government forces saying "this is something one should talk about in another time, in another country." He and a priest both agreed that many of the refugees in this nearby town were from guerrilla families. The conclusion of the cable noted that the area was war-ravaged with the government controlling the towns, the guerrillas the countryside, and “most civilians attempt[ing] to Maintain a tenuous neutrality." With El Mozote in guerrilla hands since August 1981, the reporting officers felt "the inhabitants were certainly passive and probably active guerrilla supporters." The cable noted inconsistency in the reported numbers of deaths, adding its estimate that no more than 300 people were in the entire canton. It noted that various contacts in the area had been unable to provide first-hand information on El Mozote, that the officials had visited "locations throughout Morazan" on January 30 and interviewed inhabitants and refugees from El Mozote and nearby cantons.

  Ambassador Hinton was clearly uncomfortable about jumping to conclusions on El Mozote. He complained to the Department on February 1 about a cable that referred to his “denying” the incident. “I would be grateful if Department would use extreme care in describing my views on alleged massacre," he wrote, noting that he had said he had no confirmation of it and no reason to believe Radio Venceremos. He added, however, that “additional evidence strongly suggests that something happened that should not have happened and that it is quite possible Salvadoran military did commit excesses." He also dismissed the Salvadoran Defense Minister's denial as "stonewalling without credibility” and told the Minister that something had "gone wrong" with the operation. The next day he pressed him to name the leaders of the battalion involved. The Defense Minister responded by calling the stories a "novella" and a "pack of lies." In May the Embassy reported it had attempted to establish a data base for further investigation of the events in El Mozote, but said it was “unable to reach a definite conclusion regarding civilian deaths" there. Reviewing all available sources, it felt that none of them “concretely indicate that anywhere near 1,009 civilians were massacred there. The El Mozote issue then appears to have been lost in the flood of ongoing embassy business.

  The assassination of Archbishop Romero in March 1980 was a brutal beginning to a terrible year in El Salvador. The Embassy, the Department, and White House quickly condemned the murder, and the Embassy concluded early that it had been carried out by the extreme right. Information obtained by the Embassy later that year and in 1981 blamed the murder on the right-wing leader Roberto D'Aubuisson. Salvadoran investigations tended to fall apart quickly. A major complication developed when D'Aubuisson and his ARENA party became a strong political force as the electoral process moved forward. U.S. pressure helped keep D'Aubuisson out of the Salvadoran presidency, but the Embassy dealt intermittently with him in the effort to move El Salvador’s political extremes toward the center. President Duarte used the widespread suspicions of D'Aubuisson's involvement in the Archbishop's assassination as a political weapon against him, and after winning the 1984 presidential election put the newly-formed Special Investigations Unit (SIU), financed by the U.S. Government, on the case to develop new leads. The U.S. Government strongly supported this effort and worked to extradite a key figure from the United States in 1987-88, but the effort was blocked by D'Aubuisson's supporters in the judiciary.

  His political rival President Duarte summed up the D'Aubuisson problem for Ambassador Corr by listing three levels of proof: moral—he was morally sure D'Aubuisson had ordered the Archbishop's assassination; police—he did not have enough evidence to arrest him; and judicial—even if he could get D‘Aubuisson arrested, there was no basis to prove his guilt in a court. The Embassy and the U.S. Government walked a difficult line on this case. It worked hard to help Duarte and the judicial authorities to build a case against D'Aubuisson and at various periods refused to have anything to do with him or give him a visa to the U.S. It also sought, successfully as it turned out, to channel his popularity to the service of building a strong civil culture in El Salvador. Despite a decade of trying, however, neither the Salvadoran nor U.S. authorities was able to bring anyone to justice for Archbishop Romero's murder. 

  When Salvadoran soldiers arrested and murdered ten people in San Sebastian on September 21, 1988, they knew they could be in trouble and put out a cover story that the prisoners had been killed in an ambush. The Embassy was skeptical of the military's story and pressed for a prompt, impartial investigation of the case. An Embassy officer stayed in close contact with the investigation, which soon had to be turned over to the SIU. The military continued to stonewall President Duarte as well as efforts by the Embassy until the case was made a critical element in Vice President Quayle's visit in early February 1989. The military then agreed to carry out a genuine investigation and asked for FBI help. Having completed its investigation, the Salvadoran High Command announced on March 11th, that it believed that nine active duty personnel were responsible for the killings and turned them over to the civilian courts for prosecution.

  The Panel concluded there was no truth to the view, voiced widely in the eighties, that the Reagan Administration's perceived
 downgrading of the importance of human rights issues sent ambassadors and reporting officers scurrying to trim their sails. In fact, the human rights reporting from Embassy San Salvador was found to be good, carefully written, and generally voluminous.<sup>[[11]](https://archive.org/details/el-salvador-93panel_202307)</sup></sup>

- On May 1989, General Noriega attempted to nullify Panama's democratic election, where Guillermo Endara had rightfully won. Following this, the US engaged in a prolonged effort to engage diplomatically via the OAS, to persuade Noriega to honor the election results. He did not. On the first of September, the same year, he illegally appointed a new provisional government, headed by his loyalists—after a coup failed, against this coup, he declared that Panama was in a state of war against the US. US soldiers and civilians were killed and wounded after this declaration of war, as well as unlawfully detained. On 20 December, 1989, Operation Just Cause was launched. The United States lawfully invaded the Republic of Panama to overthrow the unelected dictatorship of General Manuel Antonio Noriega. By capturing the general, defeating the military forces he commanded, and returning the country back to the rightful, democratically-elected government. There are many authoritative studies on Operation Just Cause, detailing its success, legality, context, and rebuilding efforts under civic and humanitarian activities.<sup>[[1]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-91-174fs.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://history.army.mil/html/books/just_cause/CMH_55-1-1_Just_%20Cause_opt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Just_Cause.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Apr/05/2001727349/-1/-1/0/B_0061_SHULTZ_AFTERMATH_WAR.PDF)</sup></sup> Further, sensational headlines alleged that Noriega was provided intelligence by the CIA, and/or other Agencies and departments.

- On October 1983, Grenada found itself in a state of 0 governance, and mass violence, in which Embassies for various countries, including the US, were attacked. In response to a formal request by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), whom these democratic states voted for action, under the 1981 treaty, due to the growing violence in the leaderless state, the US led the joint effort to restore order and peace. The limited stability operations led to very few civilian casualties. "Grenadian casualties were 45 killed and 337 wounded. 24 of the Grenadian dead were civilians, 21 of whom were killed in an unfortunate bombing of a mental hospital located adjacent to an anti-aircraft installation. 24 Cubans were killed and 59 wounded of the approximately 800 Cuban 'construction workers' on the island...

- During the 1980s, allegations from the Baltimore Sun, reported in 1995, allegations of CIA's complicity in Honduran human rights abuses of the Battalion 3-16 (316), etc. This triggered then-DCI John M. Deutch to direct a review of the allegations, from the 1980s to 1995, the review, known as the Honduras Working Group concluded, "there is no information in CIA files indicating that CIA officers either authorized or were directly involved in human rights abuses." Some issues remained unresolved, and reported this to CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin. In July 1996, she requested the Inspector General investigate these outstanding matters. The IG report corroborated the Working Group's findings, "No evidence has been found to substantiate the allegation that any CIA employee was present during sessions of hostile interrogation or torture in Honduras." It also found no connection to the CIA in connection to, or evidence of the existence to ELACH, an alleged right-wing paramilitary organization; nor involved in any attempts to cover-up or downplay reporting. These two reviews independently corroborated a 1988 IG investigation that found no CIA aid or connection to any human rights abuses. An OGC review also confirmed CIA had no involvement in, planned, or otherwise connected to Olancho Operation. CIA policy regarding interrogations, and human rights in general is best described in a January 14, 1985 HQ cable: "...Intervewing and interrogation of suspect in custody is a method routinely used by police, security and intelligence services around the world. In many countries, legal and basic rights of the suspect in custody may not be given full consideration, resulting in deprivation of his/her human rights. CIA policy is not to participate directly in nor to encourage interrogation that results in the use of force, mental or physical torture, extremely demeaning indignities or exposure to inhumane treatment of any kind, as an aid to interrogation. CIA policy is to actively discourage the use of these methods during interrogations. CIA should play a positive role in influencing foreign liasion to respect human rights." Participation includes being in the room during an interrogation, sitting in an adjoining room monitoring the interrogation or providing questions while an interrogation is in progress. 

  A March 1976 HQ cable described CIA's Human Rights Policies and guidance: "...employees must be especially sensitive to the political and possible legal ramifications of what the CIA does. This cable also included a description of CIA officer's responsibilities if it were to be discovered that a host or third country intelligence or security service was about to undertake actions that could reasonably be construed to be gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. CIA personnel  also were advised in this cable that, as a general rule, they should make appropriate efforts to prevent or delay such actions..."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000159944.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The US had no involvement in the Argentina military coup in 1976. The US noted in the years prior, "consistently characterized the situation in Argentina as “deteriorating.” Throughout 1975 and into early 1976, U.S. officials in Argentina repeatedly warned Washington that a coup was likely due to crime, violence, and instability under the government of Isabel Peron. US intelligence focused more on collection on leftist terrorists such as Montoneros and ERP, who finances their operations through kidnapping and extortion, sometimes targeted U.S. citizens. The Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations all pressured the new government to abide by human rights, and release those illegally imprisoned. Carter's being the most public and vocal, while Reagan pressured behind closed doors. during 1977 and 1978 the Carter Administration’s policy toward Argentina was shaped by the Kennedy-Humphrey Amendment (P.L. 95-92, sec. 11), a Congressionally-mandated halt on all U.S. military aid, training, and arms sales to Argentina, which was enacted in August 1977 and went into effect on October 1, 1978. Carter’s human rights pressure also pushed the junta to look for allies elsewhere who were less focused on human rights, including in the Eastern bloc and the Soviet Union.<sup>[[1]](https://www.intel.gov/argentina/history)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/STEPS%20TO%20IMPROVE%20U.S.-ARG%5B15503036%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>

- No, the CIA did not "admit" to the 1973 coup. As part of a Track I strategy to block Allende from taking office after the 4 Sept election, CIA sought to influence a Congressional run-off vote required by the Constitution because Allende did not win an absolute majority. While Allende was in office, the 40 Cmte approved the redirection of Track I operations to strengthen opposition political parties. Under Track II, CIA sought to instigate a coup to prevent Allende from taking office in the 4 Sept election & before, Congress' vote. CIA worked with 3  groups of plotters. Contact with 1 group was dropped early on because of its extremist tendencies. The third group, acting independently of the CIA at that time, attempted to kidnap Schneider, mortally wounding him in the attack. Although CIA provided weapons to one of the groups, we have found no information that the plotters’ or CIA’s intention was for the general to be killed. In addition to Viaux, CIA had established contact with other coup-plotters, including General Camilo Valenzuela.  Valenzuela’s group was well known by the Station and was judged to have the capability to carry out a successful coup.  CIA provided this group—which also saw the abduction of General Schneider as essential to any coup—three submachine guns, ammunition, and 8 to 10 tear gas grenades on 22 October.  (These weapons were later returned unused to the Station.)  Valenzuela’s representative insisted his group had nothing to do with Schneider’s killing and that Viaux acted on his own. Both Track initiatives ran simultaneously until Congress elected Allende on 24 Oct. After the 1970 election, CIA kept contacts on Chilean military officers in order to continue intel collection activities, however, there was no effort to assist them. As coup rumours and planning escalated by the end of 1972, CIA exercised extreme care in all dealings with Chilean military officers and continued to monitor their activities but under no circumstances attempted to influence them. By Oct 1972 the consensus within the US government was that the military intended to launch a coup at some point, that it did not need US support for a successful coup, and that US intervention or assistance in a coup should be avoided. When CIA's station in Chile became convinced that opposition had shifted towards a coup, CIA HQ reaffirmed to the Station that there was to be no involvement with the military in any covert action; there was no support for instigating a military coup. Per Congress staff report, "despite frequent allegations of such aid, was the United States involved in the 1973 coup in Chile? The Cmte has found no evidence that it was." Further, "transcripts of a phone conversation between Kissinger and Nixon reveal that they did not have a hand in the final coup."<sup>[[1]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=13)</sup></sup> 

  In March 1974, on the six-month anniversary of the Junta’s establishment, Pinochet verbally attacked the Christian Democratic Party and stated that there was no set timetable for the return to civilian rule.  On 18 December 1974 Pinochet was declared Supreme Leader of the nation. During this period, CIA, in coordination with the Department of State, determined that no new or expanded covert action activities were to be carried out until the 40 Committee provided new authorization.  Although covert action spending was authorized for previously obligated expenditures and commitments in programs described above, no new initiatives were authorized.  By June 1974 CIA covert action plans for Chile had been officially terminated, and payments ceased. Although some of these residual propaganda operations may have benefited Pinochet and the putchists indirectly, officers of the CIA and the Intelligence Community were not involved in facilitating Pinochet’s accession to President nor the consolidation of his power as Supreme Leader.  For most of the period, CIA had no covert action authority for Chile. While the CIA had liaison relationships with various security services over the years, there is no indication that any service asked for, or that the CIA offered, any assistance to promote Pinochet to the Presidency.<sup>[[3]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=14)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=15)</sup></sup> 
   
  CIA admonished Chilean agents against human rights abuses. CIA officers & assets were tasked to report on human rights violations by the government. During a period between 1974 & 1977, CIA maintained contact with Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who later became notorious for his involvement in human rights abuses. The US Government policy community approved CIA's contacts with Contreras, given his position as chief of the primary intelligence organization in Chile, as necessary to accomplish the CIA's mission, in spite of concerns that this relationship might lay the CIA open to charges of aiding internal political repression. From the start, the CIA made it clear to Contreras was that it would not support any of his activities or activities of his service which might be construde as "internal political repression." In its contacts with Contreras, the CIA urged him to adhere to a 17 January 1974 circular, issued by the Chilean Ministry of Defense, spelling out guidelines for handling prisoners in a manner consistent with the 1949 Geneva Convention. In May and June 1975, elements within the CIA recommended establishing a paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his unique position and access to Pinochet. This proposal was overruled, citing the US Government policy on clandestine relations with the head of an intelligence service notorious for human rights abuses. However, given miscommunications in the timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras.<sup>[[5]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=16)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=17)</sup></sup> CIA actively used its contacts, especially with members of services notorious for human rights abuses, to emphasize that human rights abuses were detrimental to the government's credibility within their own country, damaging their international reputation, & unacceptable to the US Government.<sup>[[7]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=15)</sup></sup> Further, A review of CIA’s files has uncovered no evidence that CIA officers and employees were engaged in human rights abuses or in covering up any human rights abuses in Chile.<sup>[[8]](https://ia600508.us.archive.org/27/items/hincheyreport-chile/HincheyreportChile.pdf#page=20)</sup></sup>

  It should be noted that the staff report did have some major errors, "The Chairman then introduced the staff director, who  with other members of the staff, summarized a staff report entitled, "Covert Action in Chile 1963-1973."The staff conclusion was even more specific: "In the period 1970 through 1973, in order to prevent a Marxist leader from coming to power by democratic means, the U.S. worked  through covert action to subvert democratic processesthis interference in the internal affairs of another country served to weaken the party  we sought to assist and created internal dissensions which, over time, led to the weakening and, for the present time at least, an end to  constitutional government in Chile." These assertions, and the Committee report on which they are based, are misleading because they make it appear that the United States was responsible for the downfall of a respectable and truly democratic government. The real character of  Allende and his coalition was ignored by excluding both public statements of philosophy and intent as well as the public record of highly  illegal actions while in office. Omitting publicly available information (not to mention the exclusion of voluminous classified intelligence dealing with Chilean support of Soviet and Cuban international subversion) makes it difficult for the American public to understand why anti-Allende operations were undertaken by three successive U.S. administrations. 

  It also cannot be overstated the dictatorship that Allende favoured over strong, traditional democratic institutions and processes. Communist Party leaders were largely in charge of the economic program of the Allende government. The communists intended gradually to replace private enterprise by State enterprise, thus enabling the government to assume complete social and economic power. The government, therefore, drew up a list of all Chilean corporations whose capital reserves exceeded $500,000. These companies, representing 82% of the capital holdings of all companies incorporated in Chile, were earmarked for nationalization. Congress attempted to block this government program by passing legislation defining the economic areas subject to government ownership, but the government continued to take over Chilean firms, using methods which became progressively more illegal. These methods ranged from expropriations (declared unconstitutional by the Chilean Supreme Court) , to requisitions (many of which were declared illegal by the Chilean Office of the Comptroller General) "decrees of insistence" (a rarely used judicial tool created to resolve differences of legal interpretations between the judiciary and the executive). In agriculture, all farms exceeding 80 hectares of irrigated land were made subject to legal expropriation. These "legal" expropriations were supplemented by those of roving armed bands who took possession of agricultural properties by force without any intervention by the Chilean police. Similarly, a series of economic pressures was exerted to silence the independent media, including coercion, bribery, the manipulation of government control over credit, imports and prices, and the incitement of strikes.
  
  As an adjunct to economic pressures, the Allende government began to develop the concept of "popular power", creating parallel revolutionary organizations which duplicated the functions of existing legal organizations. For example, special communal commands, known as JAPS, were established to control the distribution of essential articles, mainly food. Government supplies were channeled through these new organizations rather than through established retailed outlets. Of Soviet origin, the communal commands had the dual function of displacing "bourgeois" organizations and of training their members for armed revolution. Prior to the Allende regime, Chile had a strong democratic tradition and a firm commitment to constitutional processes. Under the Allende regime, its institutions fought long and tenaciously to save themselves from destruction by legal, constitutional means. When the government violated Chilean law, protests were filed with the courts and "contraloria." When the courts and the Contraloria objected to these violations, however, the government either paid no heed to these decisions or over-ruled them through "decrees of insistence", which were themselves illegal. The National Congress also tried to check these violations of the law by impeaching the ministers responsible for them, but Allende merely moved the ousted ministers from one post to another, thus thwarting the purpose of Congressional sanctions. Finally, when all the protests of the Congress, the courts and the Contraloria had been repeatedly ignored, these bodies solemnly declared that the Allende government had placed itself outside both the law and the Constitution. These declarations were made by the Supreme Court on May 26, 1973, by the Contraloria on July 2, 1973, and by the Chamber of Deputies on August 22, 1973.

  The Chamber's declaration was, in fact, a notice to the armed forces that the legal and constitutional order of the country had broken down."<sup>[[9]](https://archive.org/details/chilereview)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=txu.059173026788036&view=2up&seq=6&q1=Report+of+the+Bar+Association)</sup></sup>

- The US Government did not create, condone, participate or ignore the activities several Latin American countries engaged in under Operation Condor.

- Dominican Republic 1915-1965. There was a succession of weak and corrupt governments in the Dominican Republic (DomRep) in the years that followed, repeatedly overthrown by revolts, whose promoters and adherents did little to strengthen the nation's economy or the public's well being. The financial situation became so bad, corruption so prevalent, and the debt load so crushing that the United States took control of DomRep customs in 1905, and did not relinquish the hold until 1941. The U.S. imposed an economic council on the republic in 1915, as a result of continual disorder and chaotic mismanagement, and in 1916 instituted a military government backed by a U.S. Marine expeditionary force. When this force withdrew after the election of a constitutional government in 1924, it left behind a well-trained native police force. One of its officeis, Rafael Lnidas Trujillo Molinas, anambitious, ruthless, and talented opportunist, managed to have  himself elected President in 1930. During the next 30 years, the Trujillo family and their favored sycophants, particularly the officer corps of the armed forces, systematically ravaged DomRep, for their personal gain. While the dictator achieved some measure of economic and administrative stability during his rule, he did so at the expense of the basic human rights of his people. DomRep was a police state, a place of fear and death for any who opposed "The Benefactor of the Republic."

  "There was no direct American participation in the assassination of Rafael Trujillo in May 1961, (who himself had been involved in an attempt to assassinate the President of Venezuela). The idea originated with the Dominicans; they acquired some of the weapons on their own; and they did the detailed planning. They were never subject to American supervision or control." Some Latin American countries thought the US had allowed his brutal regime, however, it was just US policy to refrain from actions that would hasten his downfall. On March 10, 1960, the CIA drafted a plan to persuade dictator Trujillo to retire. The plan was for Clark to approach Trujillo, with whom he had been on good terms in the past, and attempt to persuade Trujillo to retire. It was to be pointed out that there was no one who could succeed him, and that to protect his family and to preserve his image as El Benefactor, he should step down and allow asylumn to be arranged for him. His family would have the wealth already outside the Dominican Republic, and the fortune inside would be placed in trust, to be administered by  internationally-known personages for the benefit of the Dominican people. This proposition received high-level attention in Washington, including that of President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Herter, and Allen Dulles. In approving Clark's approach to Trujillo, the President specified that Clark should travel as a representative of the State Department, rather than as a personal emissary of the President. General Clark traveled to the Dominican Republic and met with Trujillo on 27 March. By the time of the meeting it appears that it had been decided that the plan would be presented as merely that of private citizen Clark, and that was what was done. The station thought it likely that Trujillo recognized the official U.S. Government hand in the proposal. Of course, nothing came of the meeting.

  Eventually, Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom told J. C. King on 28 June 1960 that the U.S. Government was prepared to participate in the overthrow of the Trujillo regime to the extent of providing a small number of sniper rifles for the removal of key Trujillo people from the scene. General Cabell, as Acting DCI, on 1 July 1960 approved delivering 12 Springfield rifles to the Dominican dissidents by air drop or by sea. The rifles were never delivered. On 10 February 1961 the chief of station cabled a suggestion that one small-size, high-fire-power weapon be forwarded in each pouch. This suggestion was not acted upon. On 17 March 1961, the chief of station cabled a request of Consul General Dearbon for the pouching of three 38 caliber Smith and Wesson Special pistols for delivery to key members of the dissident group. Headquarters was preparing to pouch the pistols but apparently did not do so. There is no indication in the operational files that the pistols were actually pouched. The request for pistols appears to have been overtaken by a subsequent request for submachine guns. On 26 March 1961 the station cabled a request for permission to pass three semi-automatic M-1 carbines plus ammunition to redacted. The carbines and ammunition  were in the consulate, having been left by departed naval personnel. The station requested that headquarters pouch magazines. Headquarters approved passing the carbines and ammunition and pouched the magazines. The cable authorizing passing the carbines was released by the DD/P (Bissell). The station said it would file off the carbines’ serial numbers. The station cabled that the carbines were passed to redacted on on 7 April 1961. Redacted at the request of the dissidents, gave the carbines to redacted for temporary safekeeping. Redacted later recovered the carbines from redacted and gave them to Antonio de la Maza, who reportedly kept them in the trunk of his automobile. It is probable that at least one of the carbines was taken to the scene of the assassination by de la Maza, but we have no evidence that it was actually used in the shooting. While at headquarters for consultations in early April 1961, Chief of Station redacted evidently prevailed upon headquarters, to pouch four M-3 submachine guns and ammunition to the station. The submachine guns were pouched and arrived at the station on 19 April 1961. Headquarters cabled the station on 17 April that the submachine guns were not to be passed to the dissidents without additional headquarters approval. Despite repeated pleas from the Chief of Station and from the Consul General, Washington continued to refuse authorization to pass them. We think it is safe to conclude that the submachine guns were never passed to the dissidents."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/RAFAEL%20TRUJILLO%2C%20THE%20DOMI%5B15603377%5D.pdf#page=61)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2021/docid-32112922.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Between 1961 through 1965 and beyond, CIA engaged in clandestine activities to create an atmosphere which will foster a democratic revolution. This was done through support of democratic institutions, labour unions, student groups, social justice groups, sponsor self-help programs such as cooperatives, community development programs, credit unions, and other activities.<sup>[[4]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-100-doc2.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  The immediate cause of the civil war lay in the May 1961 assassination of Generalissimo Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina and the ensuing political chaos. By April 1965 two powerful factions had emerged, the Loyalists and the Constitutionalists. The Loyalists, supported by Colonel Elias Wessin y Wessin who commanded the 1,500 man autonomous Armed Forces Training Center, backed the government led by President Donald Reid Cabral. The Constitutionalists, supported by elements of the military, backed the exiled socialist politician Juan Bosch, who had briefly held the Dominican Republic’s presidency in 1963 before being ousted in a coup, and wanted his liberalizing constitution reinstated. On 24 April 1965 President Reid revoked the military commissions of several young officers suspected of planning a coup against his government. In response, they revolted, adopted the label of Constitutionalists, and persuaded approximately 1,500 soldiers and a unit of the Dominican Navy’s elite frogmen to join their cause. The Constitutionalists made radio announcements and distributed 20,000 weapons throughout Santo Domingo. The military units aligned with the Constitutionalists and armed civilian groups began attacking police, buildings of rival political groups, and occupying strategic positions throughout the city. Despite a pre-revolt strength of over 17,000 men, the Dominican military’s personnel loyal to Reid’s government were divided and disorganized. Only Wessin y Wessin’s 1,500 AFTC soldiers and elements of the Dominican Air Force were capable of immediate action.

  Operation Power Pack. Within a few days in April 1965, the U.S. was compelled to take drastic steps which it found distasteful but necessary. In response to the rapidly deteriorating situation on 25 April President Johnson directed the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to prepare to evacuate American nationals. Two days later, unarmed Marines from the USS Boxer helicoptered to Haina (ten miles south-west of Santo Domingo) to evacuate American civilians brought from the Hotel Embajador in Santo Domingo. The next day a battalion of Marines landed at Haina, proceeded to the Hotel Embajador, and established a helipad on the nearby polo field from which nearly 700 civilians were evacuated. Unfortunately, the situation in Santo Domingo continued to deteriorate. On 28 April harassment of Americans continued, the U.S. embassy came under sniper fire, and Ambassador William Bennett reported “collective madness” engulfing the city. After receiving an early morning written request on 29 April for help from the Loyalists, at 1930 hrs President Johnson authorized the use of overwhelming force to stabilize the situation. Soldiers from the 82d Airborne Division and Marines from the 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigade were dispatched to reinforce the embassy, protect American nationals in Santo Domingo, and prevent a communist takeover. The President recognized that by bypassing the Organization of American States (OAS), American unilateral action would cause diplomatic tensions with OAS members, but he remained confident enough members could be convinced to offer support after the situation improved.

  The stability operations, which lasted from 30 April to 3 May, can be separated into three phases: 1) The landing at San Isidro Airfield (about ten miles east of Santo Domingo); 2) The eight mile advance west from the airfield to the Ozama River; 3) The establishment of a line of communications to link the airfield with the International Security Zone (INSZ) around the US Embassy, thereby separating the two factions. The operation was based on JCS Operation Plan 310/2-63, which had been rehearsed several times, but did not include current political or geographic information.<sup>[[5]](https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/dominican.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/U_S_%20Marine%20Corps%20Operations%20In%20The%20Dominican%20Republic%20April%20-%20June%201965.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://ia801305.us.archive.org/17/items/Misc-DoD/The%20Dominican%20Republic%20Crisis%20of%201965_text.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://ia601305.us.archive.org/17/items/Misc-DoD/Chronology%20of%20the%20Crisis%20in%20the%20Dominican%20Republic%20April%2024%20to%20August%2031%2C%201965_text.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- Between the 1960s and 1974, the US Agency for International Development (AID) begun a world-wide program to help train police in various countries to develop better professionally, including respect for human rights. While results varied, it should be noted, contrary to conspiracy theorists and political pundits, that the CIA was not involved with AID's Office of Public Safety, by which this activity was run.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP73B00296R000100020105-3.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-92-118.pdf)</sup></sup> Some may try to suggest the Special Group CI is evidence of CIA's involvement—however, such programs were just "scrutinized" by SGCI.<sup>[[3]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v08/d102)</sup></sup> 

- In Bolivia, 1971, CIA made a one-time payment to discourage a reportedly imminent coup and to “cement relations” with Bolivian military figures. Unknown to the CIA, a coup would follow two days later.<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve10/d76a)</sup></sup>

- The basic covert action goals in Bolivia are to foster democratic solutions to critical and social, economic, and political problems; to check Communist and Cuban subversion; to encourage a stable government favorably inclined toward the United States; and to encourage Bolivian participation in the Alliance for Progress. US President Johnson took office in 1963, he inherited a longstanding U.S. Government policy of providing financial support for Bolivian political leaders. The policy was intended to promote stability in Bolivia by strengthening moderate forces, especially within the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) itself, which had a strong left wing under the leadership of Juan Lechin Oquendo, General Secretary of the Mine Workers’ Federation. In August 1963 the 5412 Special Group approved a covert subsidy to assist the MNR to prepare for the presidential elections scheduled for May 1964. The Special Group agreed in March 1964 that the MNR receive additional financial support. Paz won the election; Lechin (who had been Vice President under Paz) left the government and founded a rival leftist party. Covert action expenditures in Bolivia between fiscal year 1963 and fiscal year 1965 were as follows: FY 63—$337,063; FY 64—$545,342; and FY 65—$287,978. The figure for FY 65 included funds to influence the campesino movement, for propaganda, to support labor organizations, and to support youth and student groups. The FY 66 program also allocated funds to support moderate political groups and individuals backing General Barrientos for President.

  On November 4, 1964, the new Vice President, General René Barrientos Ortuño (MNR), led a successful military coup d’etat, forcing Paz into exile, (No US involvement in coup). In February 1965 the 303 Committee authorized a financial subsidy to the MNR under Barrientos (who was aware of U.S. financial support to the MNR) to help establish an organizational base for the presidential election scheduled for September. In May 1965 Barrientos responded to growing labor unrest by arresting and deporting Lechin and postponing the election. The 303 Committee, which considered a recommendation to support Barrientos as the best available candidate, agreed in July 1965 and March 1966 to authorize additional funds for MNR propaganda and political action in support of the ruling Junta’s plans to pacify the country and hold elections to establish a civilian, constitutional government.

  When the presidential election was finally held in July 1966, Barrientos won easily, and officials concerned with the covert operation concluded that the objectives of the program—the _end of military rule_ and a _civilian, constitutional government_ whose _policies would be compatible with those of the United States—had been accomplished._<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d147)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://sgp.fas.org/advisory/state/bolivia.html)</sup></sup>

- By March 1964, it appeared to many in Brazil, and around the world that Goulart was "definitely engaged on campaign to seize dictatorial power". As the "immediate tactics of the Goulart palace guard are concentrated on pressures to secure from the Congress constitutional reforms unattainable by normal means, using a combination of sporadic rural violence, and abuse of the enormous discretionary financial power of the federal government." Combined with subjecting radio and TV outlets to a partial censorship, increasing the use of the National News Agency and requisitioning broadcast time for its reformist propaganda, and making thinly veiled threats against the opposition press. The purpose is not in fact to secure constructive social and economic reforms, but to discredit the existing constitution and the Congress, laying a foundation for a coup from the top down which might then be ratified by a rigged plebiscite and the rewriting of the constitution by a rigged Constituent Assembly." To counter this, the declassified record has only shown that the US, "covert support for pro-democracy street rallies, discreet passage of word that USG deeply concerned at events, and encouragement democratic and anti-Communist sentiment in Congress, armed forces, friendly labor and student groups, church, and business." No evidence has been found that the US was involved directly or indirectly in the coup.<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d187)</sup></sup>

- In 1964 the US covertly supported an independent British Guiana (Guyana), by funding various left/moderate minority-group political parties for upcoming democratic elections, to reach the goal of a moderate Government that would pursue a multi-racial policy, and engage in realistic social and economic development programs. Initially the US worked with Cheddi Jagan, but he became more racist and aligned with the Soviet Union, since the PPP militia requested and started to receive KGB covert aid.<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20141018135832/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000112273.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/Guianaoverview)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1962, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the DoD approved a draft plan, in response to Soviet missile crisis in Cuba, known as Operation Northwoods, which authorised (but never conducted): Start rumours; Land friendly Cubans in uniform "over the fence" to stage attack on base; capture (friendly) saboteurs inside base; start riots near base (friendly Cubans); blow up ammunition inside the base; start fires; sink ship near harbor entrance.; Conduct funerals for mock-victims; fake a shootdown of a remotely piloted aircraft.

 - 1960-1962, CIA's activities against Castro. A number of allegations stem from a poor reading of selective documents, out of thousands: that assassination and sabotage was a main and integral part of anti-Castro activities, including the use of the mafia. An authoritative history on the subject finds this is not so:
   > "By way of summarizing, it would appear that CIA's official anti-Castro program as reflected in Project JMATE did not include assassination as an integral part of its operational planning... In terms of Project JMATE itself, the few bits
of information which indicate the possibility of assassination attempts against the Cuban leadership also fail to demonstrate any responsibility for their initiation on the part of WH/4. If anything, the evidence would indicate that WH/4's position was one of watchful waiting and wishful thinking that dissident Cubans would themselves eliminate the Castros and Che Guevara. The possibility, of course, that Agency-supplied weapons might be involved in such an attempt cannot be ruled out. Obviously it would be foolish to contend that those principally responsible for developing CIA's anti-Castro program would have objected to the assassination of Fidel Castro. On the other hand, this was not one of the basic concepts nor intentions of the official program of the Central Intelligence Agency."

   > "Similarly, because of the sensationalism which surrounded the Senate Select Committee's report on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders, including Fidel Castro and the implications that the Mafia plot was a part of the authorized planning for the Bay of Pigs Operation, a thorough examination of the evidence was undertaken to determine if this allegation was supportable. It was not. The Mafia operation was run aside from, apart from, and independent of the formal anti-Castro program which was undertaken by CIA... allegations that the assassination plans being developed by the Mafia were a fundamental part of the official US Government program to overthrow Fidel Castro: There is no basis in fact for this charge."

   > "...aside from considerable emphasis on the propaganda activity, there was only limited support for sabotage activities prior to the end of Eisenhower's administration. There was considerable concern over the necessary formalities of diplomacy in order that the United States not be involved in investigations by either the UN or the OAS for its anti-Castro program."<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10301-10004.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
   > The various pieces of evidence that seemed to implicate WH/4 in assassination plots against Castro or other of the Cuban leaders proved to be cold trails. The peripatetic Howard Hunt claimed, even prior to the Senate investigations, that after a visit to Havana in the spring of 1960, he prepared a report recommending among other things that the Agency should:  "Assassinate Castro before or coincident with the invasion (a task for Cuban patriots)... Barnes and Bissell read my report and said it would weigh in the final planning ... So far as I have been able to determine no coherent plan was ever developed within CIA to assassinate Castro, but it was the heart's desire of many exile groups."  In another instance, it appeared possible that an agent named [reacted] a Cuban exile, might have been in training to make an assassination attempt because it was reported that he  was taken to the [redacted] firing range where he was checked out in the use of the Special .38 Airweight semi-hammerless pistol; British Welrod pistol, single shot, a 9mm parabellum with silencer; carbine with folding stock; and a 7.65mm British Welrod with silencer. He is to be also checked out this week in the use of a sporting rifle with telescopic lens attachment. It was revealed subsequently that upon his reinfiltration into Havana, [redacted] had two principal sabotage missions.
   
   Further, "The cumulative impact of the foregoing and the attachments are the strong suggestions that organized crime elements had an ongoing operation to assassinate Castro before this Agency instituted Phase I and that Frank Sturgis was involved with these organized crime elements." The same was concluded for Sam Giancana.<sup>[[2]](https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/cia/18395.pdf)</sup></sup>   
   
   Lastly, Operation Mongoose had strict limitations on sabotage: "No sabotage would be undertaken against food supplies, medical facilities, or directly against the population of Cuba as such."<sup>[[3]](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/6434690/National-Security-Archive-Doc-14-CIA-William.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup>
   
- Between 1958 and 1966, US helped Colombia deal with anti-narcotics efforts and counter-terrorism operations via train and advise efforts. US Survey teams recommended "Employing the [Colombian] armed forces in tasks intended to contribute to the economic development and social well-being of all Colombians, especially those subjected to guerrilla-bandit activity." Following this recommendation, the Lleras administration established rehabilitation commissions and thirty welfare teams to coordinate efforts to improve living conditions of those affected by violent activity. The rehabilitation commissions, which operated at a national level, tracked programs in designated zones, coordinated relief efforts, and improved access to credit for peasants displaced by the violence.  The welfare teams, which operated at a local level, consisted of a doctor, a nurse, agrarian technicians, an engineer, a veterinarian, a home economist, and sometimes a public administrator. The teams acted as on-the-ground advisors for small, local projects, such as “[building] rural schools, mills, medical facilities, or ‘model’ farms.”10 In conjunction with the US country team, the military also developed plans to mend violence-ridden regions through social projects. First on an ad hoc basis, but then under the auspices of a presidential decree, the Colombian government developed road infrastructure, health care facilities, literacy programs, and access to potable water, among other activities, in the affected areas. Many Colombians were trained at the US Army School of the Americas (SOA), on civic action programs. By 1969, the Colombian government had built 138 road systems; provided medical treatment to 1.1 million civilians and dental care to nearly 900,000; and built forty-four wells, twenty-three health centers, and ninety-nine schools. Crime statistics during this period did decline, as did participation in criminal bands. A study of the impact of the civic action projects (code name Simpatico) conducted in the late 1960s by the Colombian and US governments did report a positive impact after exhaustive research in the affected areas.<sup>[[1]](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=monographs)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://arsof-history.org/articles/pdf/v2n4_plan_lazo.pdf)</sup></sup> Conspiracy theorists have long-alleged that the US provided support to Los Pepes. However, an independent panel found that some intelligence provided to the Medellín Task Force may have incidentally ended up in their hands. by locals. CIA reported that the Colombian defense minister, Rafael Pardo, was "concerned that the police are providing intelligence to Los Pepes." A document titled, "Colombia: Extralegal Steps Against Escobar Possible," Agency analysts predicted that President Gaviria's "demand for an intensified effort to capture Escobar may lead some subordinates to rely more heavily on Los Pepes and on extralegal means."<sup>[[3]](https://ia601502.us.archive.org/0/items/lospepes-blue-ribbon-1/lospepes%20blue%20ribbon1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/20/items/lospepes-blueribbon-2/lospepes%20blueribbon2.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.soc.mil/ARIS/books/pdf/ARIS_Colombia-BOOK.pdf)</sup></sup> 
    
- In 1958, the United States approached Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, to step down from power, both formally and with his long-standing friend in business, and for him to leave the Cuba scene for good, not support any elected person who'd merely be his puppet—in a bid to politically cease the hostilities between the "revolutionaries" who used terrorist tactics, against the Government and civilian populations. The US ceased its military aid to Batista, only supplying a limited number of radios. Prior to even 1958, the United States pressured, to some success, for the regime's military forces to respect human rights from a top-down level.<sup>[[1]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v06/d189)</sup></sup>

- In 1954, the CIA had an involvement in the coup in Guatemala. However, a number of myths persist as to why the US did what they did: That it was driven because of United Fruit lobbying (capitalism interests); was against the peasants, farmers, overall, the working class and engaged in assassinations. This narrative simply just doesn't fall in line with facts of reality:
  > "The US was concerned of Soviet penetration, as a breach head to launch attacks and other operations by the KGB against the US, as it became increasingly overt and covert in its influence operations in Guatemala."

  > "United Fruit's vast holdings and monopolies on communications and transit in Central America attracted the attention of lawyers in the Justice Department's antitrust division as early as 1919. In May 1951, they were preparing for court action to force United Fruit to divest itself of railroads and utilities in Guatemala when State Department intervened. In a National Security Council session, Department representatives argue that a legal attack on United Fruit's Guatemalan holdings would have 'serious foreign policy implications,' weakening the company at a time when the United States needed it. The action was suspended until the situation in Guatemala had improved. It is often asserted that the United States acted at the company's behest in Guatemala, but this incident suggests the opposite was true: the administration wanted to use United Fruit to contain Communism in the hemisphere." After the success of PBSUCCESS and United Fruit's use had ended, "the State Department demanded the company grant higher wages , not just in Guatemala, but throughout the hemisphere. The Eisenhower administration proceeded with its suspended antitrust action, and in 1958 the company signed a consent decree divesting it of its holdings in railroads and marketing operations."
  
  > "CIA supported the objectives of the Guatemalan land reform—the breakup of large estates into small freeholds—in some of its own programs. the Agency supported farm cooperative movement. In 1951, the Directorate of Plans undertook a global program to encourage small, independent landowners. In Guatemala, the program organised 15,000 peasants into 75 study groups, each of which formed a credit union to help its members buy land."<sup>[[1]](https://ia601303.us.archive.org/6/items/CIA-Guatemala-Coup-Report/DOC_0000134974.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20180609064148/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000135796.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1915, the United States undertook a military occupation of Haiti to preempt any European intervention, to establish order out of civil strife, and to stabilize Haitian finances. During the nineteen-year occupation, U.S. military and civilian officials, numbering less than 2,500 for the most part, supervised the collection of taxes and the disbursement of revenues, maintained public order, and initiated a program of public works. The Haitian government remained in place, but was subject to U.S. guidance. The Haitian people benefitted from the end of endemic political violence and from the construction of roads, bridges, and ports as well as from improved access to health care.

  In the early twentieth century, Haiti suffered from a tumultuous political life and from chronic financial mismanagement. Eighty percent of the Haitian budget went to debt service, and U.S. government officials were concerned that financial obligations to its own citizens might not be met. There was greater fear, also, that one among the warring European countries -- especially France or Germany -- might establish a position of influence in the country, leading to naval bases that could endanger access to the newly constructed Panama Canal. These concerns were heightened after the outbreak of World War I, when Haitian authority collapsed into bloody factional struggles in the summer of 1915; the Administration of Woodrow Wilson determined to take action. In July 1915, Admiral William B. Caperton, then embarked on the battleship Washington, was directed to land forces to establish order and assume responsibility for administering the customhouses.

  Once firmly established in the major population centers, U.S. officials quickly ensured the election by the Haitian National Assembly of an amenable president, Philippe Sudre Dartiguenave, who had served as the president of the Haitian Senate. As a result of continuing unrest, Admiral Caperton also established censorship and promulgated martial law. These emergency measures were not rescinded for over ten years. In another move to ensure an orderly government, the United States presented the Haitians with a treaty that permitted a U.S.-nominated official to collect taxes and make debt repayments and other disbursements. The treaty, (1) ratified by Haiti in November 1915 and by the U.S. Senate the following February, also created a constabulary (or gendarmerie) composed of native Haitians under American direction to serve both as Haiti's military and police force. The treaty was to remain in force for ten years and could be extended for another ten "if the purpose of this treaty has not been fully accomplished." In March 1917, the duration of the 1915 treaty was officially extended to twenty years.

  The Gendarmerie, whose name was changed in 1928 to the Garde d'Haiti, became an essential part of the administrative structure of the country. Officered at first by Americans -- largely enlisted marines -- who were paid both by the U.S. Marine Corps and by Haiti, the Gendarmerie, numbering 2,000-2,600 members, was deployed throughout the country and became largely responsible for maintaining law and order, settling disputes, and supporting public works projects. It also served as Haiti's military force. Gradually, U.S. officers were replaced by Haitians, a process that was accelerated after 1929. Historians, otherwise critical of the occupation, acknowledge that Haitians had more security in their persons and property than they had ever previously known and that the Gendarmerie, during the occupation, functioned as an effective and impartial agency. (After U.S. forces departed in 1934, Haitian officers would become much more involved in political activities.)

  Complaints of brutality against native Haitians led the U.S. Congress to conduct hearings on Haiti and the Dominican Republic in 1922. The special committee rejected the more serious charges and concluded that most of the abuses occurred during the effort to put down the caco insurrection in 1918-1919. The counterinsurgency effort resulted in the deaths, by some estimates, of over 2,000 cacos. The Committee found no abuse was ever sanctioned—and upon alleged, swift justice followed.

  The onset of the Great Depression and declining markets for Haitian products, especially coffee, produced economic hardships and contributed to increased unrest among a population long denied a political role. December 1929 riots in Les Cayes threatened to spread throughout the country. A detachment from the Marine Brigade in Port-au-Prince was sent to restore order, but a confrontation led to the deaths of at least 12 Haitians. Subsequent incidents were ended without loss of life, but the Hoover Administration was concerned that it might become involved in hostilities that U.S. public opinion would not support.

  In early 1930, President Hoover appointed a bipartisan commission headed by W. Cameron Forbes, formerly the Governor General of the Philippines, to investigate conditions in Haiti. After several weeks in the country during which testimony was taken from all sectors of the society, the commission submitted a report that argued that the United States could not relinquish its responsibilities for ensuring the financial stability of Haiti, but made several proposals for changes, especially the separation of civil and military responsibilities, increasing the number of Haitians in the government, and, in general, for less intervention in Haitian domestic affairs. In November, General Russell was replaced by a State Department official, Dana G. Munro, who was appointed Minister rather than High Commissioner. An Executive Agreement was negotiated in 1932 providing for the complete Haitianization of the Garde by October 1934 and for the withdrawal of the Marine Brigade, two years prior to the expiration of the extended 1915 Treaty. Washington was nonetheless determined to pull out of Haiti at an earlier date. Arrangements were made for the election of a temporary Haitian president and the subsequent holding of national elections in October 1930 that returned a strongly nationalistic majority. The complete Haitianization of the Garde was completed. President Franklin Roosevelt paid an official visit to Cap-Haitien in July 1934 and the last marines departed the following month. Nonetheless, a U.S. financial adviser would remain until 1941 to oversee payments on the Haitian debt.

  The U.S. occupation in large measure accomplished its goals of stabilizing Haitian finances. Security for investors was a key concern of the U.S. Government and to a large extent became the justification for the occupation once the potential threat of European intervention disappeared with the conclusion of World War I. A $16-million U.S. loan was negotiated in 1922 to consolidate Haiti's outstanding foreign debts. Efficient collection of duties and prompt, even advance, payment of debts owed to U.S. banks soon restored the country's financial standing. Eventually, some 60% of Haitian revenues were expended under U.S. supervision, the greatest percentage going to debt repayment. Some critics, including the Forbes Commission, argued that monies used for advance repayment of debts could have been more usefully allocated to domestic projects. There is consensus, however, that Haitian finances were honestly handled during the occupation and that steps were taken to insure that foreign interests did not take advantage of the country. In the 1920s, annual Haitian government revenues of $8-10 million were double that of the pre-occupation period; coffee production and small businesses grew significantly, but little progress was made in establishing a sound permanently economic base for the country.

  The United States undertook a major effort to provide access to modern health care to the mass of the Haitian population that in some cases had never come into contact with trained doctors and nurses. A National Public Health Service was created with a network of some 153 rural clinics and 11 hospitals supervised by U.S. Navy doctors, and efforts were made to provide basic medical instruction to the population. This effort was financed by the Haitian government at U.S. encouragement.<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081233847&seq=9)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044084839125&seq=5)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/94-459.html)</sup></sup>

  The vast majority of the opposition to Qadhafi was not linked to militant extremism: legal professionals and civil society activists were among the first people to call for reform on the steps of the Benghazi courthouse in February 2011; and the National Transitional Council (NTC) and its Executive Office were led by Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, a former Minister under Qadhafi, and Mahmoud Jibril, a reformer who had worked with Saif al-Islam Qadhafi. NTC members were drawn from across Libya and included representatives of Libya’s minority groups and women. The armed opposition included many professional military officers who had defected from Qadhafi in protest at his response to the peaceful demonstrations.

  The UK, NATO and the UN acknowledged the security risk posed by weapons abandoned by the Qadhafi regime and took action to track and secure them. In 2011 and 2012, the UK supported a US-led project to secure man-portable surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS) within Libya. Joint Libyan, American and French teams inspected more than 1,600 bunkers and identified, secured, disabled or confirmed as destroyed around 5,000 MANPADS components and complete systems. The UK also provided £1.4m and civilian experts to support the inspection of ammunition storage areas. In 2013 and 2014, the UK led international efforts to focus specifically on the issue of arms and ammunition. As part of a cross-Government Security, Justice and Defence (SJD) programme, UK advisers supported and facilitated local council and militia agreements to build and secure five temporary storage facilities.<sup>[[17]](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/834/834.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Since 2007, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), has done a number of assistance programs to African countries, ranging from humanitarian aid, civil assistance, etc.<sup>[[1]](https://www.africom.mil/what-we-do)</sup></sup>
  Some of these are:
   - >Foreign Disaster Relief: Foreign Disaster Relief activities are unique Department of Defense capabilities (normally airlift or logistics) supporting USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) specific requests as approve by the U.S. Secretary of Defense. AFRICOM has responded to two disasters in the last decade (Ebola in West Africa in 2014, and Tropical Storm Idia in Mozambique in 2018), while BHA responds to dozens annually. The international community and BHA are normally able to respond to most disasters without DoD support. It is only the sudden onset catastrophic disasters overwhelming international community that require DoD support.
   - >Humanitarian and Civic Assistance: Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) activities are conducted in conjunction with authorized operations and exercises of the military services in a foreign country, with the approval of the partner nation national and local civilian authorities, and complement - not duplicate - other forms of humanitarian assistance provided to the partner nation by the Department of State and USAID. Funded by AFRICOM, these activities also serve the basic economic and social needs of the partner nation and promote the security and foreign policy interests of the U.S., the security interests of the country in which the activities are to be performed, and the specific operational readiness skills of the service members who participate in the HCA activities.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Disaster Preparedness Program: The Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP) increases the capacity of African nations to mitigate and prepare for an all-hazard disaster response within the ministry designated to respond. The program supports civilian-military interface, and enhancing collaboration and the military’s ability to perform their civil support functions. It also improves the capacity for regional interaction and stability in the event of a complex emergency such as a pandemic event. Working with national and regional entities in a comprehensive, holistic manner, the program builds capacity and capability over time. Funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), the DPP may provide training, planning support, technical assistance, exercise validation, and equipment purchases.
   - >Humanitarian Mine Action: The Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) program relieves human suffering and the adverse effects of land mines and other explosive remnants of war on noncombatants - including ammunition stockpiles - while advancing theater campaign plan strategies and U.S. national security objectives. The Department of Defense supports foreign governments in detection, clearance, physical security, and stockpile management of landmines and other explosive remnants of war by executing cadre development programs designed to develop capabilities for a wide range of HMA activities including education, training, and technical assistance.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Other: U.S. Africa Command’s Humanitarian Assistance - Other (HA-O) program includes activities designed to relieve or reduce endemic conditions such as human suffering, disease, hunger, and privation, particularly in regions where humanitarian needs may pose major challenges to stability, prosperity, and respect for universal human values. These program activities are funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), and address basic healthcare, education, and infrastructure needs. Common projects include construction of health clinics, schools, and provision of humanitarian supplies, and are intended to reduce the risk of, prepare for, mitigate the consequences of, or respond to humanitarian disasters.
   - >Pandemic Response Program: Since 2008 U.S. Africa Command has worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development to establish a Pandemic Response Program (PRP) aimed at assisting African militaries develop influenza pandemic response plans that are integrated into their country’s overall national response plans. Militaries can play key roles in the event of a pandemic, working in collaboration with other governmental, non-governmental and international organizations to maintain security, provide logistical support for food, medicine and other commodities, maintain communications, and provide augmented medical care. PRP strives to improve the capacity for regional stability in the event of a complex emergency by providing training and technical assistance, and identifies - and at times purchases - limited equipment needed for selected countries.
   - >Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP): The Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program is the DoD initiative in support of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that aims to support healthy and functional military forces to provide stability and safety to national and regional populations. Africa’s high rates of HIV/AIDS negatively impact African militaries and other uniformed organizations by reducing readiness, limiting peacekeeping deployments, and increasing risk to military and civilian personnel. DHAPP provides military-to-military program support by assisting in the development and implementation of culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment programs. AFRICOM provides oversight and strategic guidance so that DHAPP can develop and implement a culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment program. At over $100 million annually and operating in 38 countries, DHAPP is AFRICOM’s largest program on the Continent.
Current strategies and interventions employed by DHAPP include: Index case HIV testing (testing spouses, sexual partners, and all children of women who test HIV-positive); Documentation of every new HIV-positive individual and linking him or her into care and treatment; Periodically updating military HIV policies to address HIV testing strategies, chain of command notifications, deployments, stigma and discrimination, and antiretroviral treatment initiation and retention to reflect changes in international normative guidance; Antiretroviral treatment services thru mobile units; Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills building, and facilitated access to condoms; Promotion of voluntary medical male circumcision services which can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection in HIV-negative men by 60%; and stigma and discrimination prevention training.

- The US Department of Defense offers legal education to any nation who requests, through the Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS).<sup>[[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEpHRVqEgs4)</sup></sup> A highly effective program that tailors to the specific host country. Members of the a foreign Military may visit the US, in Resident programs, or, the US may conduct workshops within the Country. These cover a wide-variety of legal issues: Human rights law, military justice, equal rights, etc.<sup>[[2]](https://globalnetplatform.org/system/files/diils_2020_catalog_no_contacts.pdf)</sup></sup> It has seen major success, over a decade, DILLS worked with a number of African nations on justice reform, and methods to investigate and prosecute military personnel for sexual violent and gender-based crimes within the military. This sustained effort saw a sharp decline in sexual assault cases, an increase in successful investigations and prosecutions. These offer the ability to increase civilian oversight of the military, to either enhance, or develop their legal framework.<sup>[[3]](https://youtu.be/zEpHRVqEgs4?t=497)</sup></sup>

- Somalia, 1992-1994. In the early 1960s the United States established a presence, including communications listening posts, in the northern part of Ethiopia and backed the traditional regime of Emperor Haile Selassie. Haile Selassie attempted to modernise the country through a series of political and social reforms, including the introduction of the 1931 constitution, its first written constitution, and the abolition of slavery. The Soviets, on the other hand, replaced the weakened Italian influence in neighboring Somalia and supported the authoritarian regime of Somali strongman Mohammed Siad Barre, who took power in 1969. After Siad Barre precipitated a disastrous war against Ethiopia over the status of the Ogaden region in 1977, the situation in Somalia grew worse. Western aid dried up, and Barre was forced to grow ever more repressive to maintain his grip on power. He began a policy of systematic kidnapping and murder against rival clan leaders that increased in ferocity over time. Finally, antigovernment riots led to overreaction on the part of Siad Barre’s bodyguards, who killed 65 civilians and seriously injured over 300 in 1990. His legitimacy in shambles, the army and the people turned against him in a prolonged series of riots, political maneuvers, and violence. Siad Barre was forced to flee the country in January 1991 with some of his closest supporters. Almost immediately, a resurgence of clan violence led to the virtual destruction of any central government and to economic chaos. As Somalia lapsed into sectarian and ethnic warfare, regional warlords drew upon clan loyalty to establish independent power bases. This situation led to a struggle over food supplies with each clan raiding the storehouses and depots of the others. Coupled with a drought, these actions brought famine to hundreds of thousands of the nation’s poor. Although private and volunteer relief organizations established refugee camps to try to prevent widespread deaths from starvation, they could not handle the massive amounts of aid and the requisite security structure that were needed. International relief organizations paid protection money to the warlords as they tried to distribute what donated food supplies did arrive. More often than not, such supplies never reached the hands of those who needed them but instead were confiscated by the warlords who distributed or sold them to enhance their own power and prestige. The general misery was only compounded by the brutality of the Somali clans toward their rivals and the sporadic outbreaks of actual fighting. The most visible elements of the suffering—pictures of starving, fly-covered children—appeared nightly on American television screens. Fresh from its triumph in Operation DESERT STORM, the administration of President George H. W. Bush felt it could not ignore the situation, despite the obvious risks of intervening in a country still at war with itself.

  The United Nations reacted to the worsening plight of Somalia in early 1992. On 24 April it approved Resolution 751, which authorized humanitarian relief operations in the stricken country and established the United Nations Operations in Somalia, or UNOSOM. Almost immediately, a small group of peacekeepers deployed to the country and tried to sort out the confusing array of clans, private armies, and relief organizations, all competing over the distribution of food relief supplies. While some progress was made in the major cities, it was apparent that significant amounts of the supplies destined for the interior were being hijacked by the armies of the clans or by the relief organizations’ security guards, hired by the UN and the relief agencies to guard the convoys of food. Since UN and private volunteer organizations were generally prohibited from hiring armed security forces, they instead hired local tribesmen as technical assistants—hence the nickname “technicals.” The technicals were armed bodyguards, often driving pick-up trucks or land cruisers with machine guns or other heavy weapons mounted.

  In response to the worsening famine, the United States decided to assist the relief efforts by airlifting food from nearby Kenya to remote airfields in the interior of Somalia for distribution, thus bypassing congested ports and reducing the need to send out easily looted convoys. For this purpose, the United States launched Operation PROVIDE RELIEF on 15 August 1992. The actual ground distribution continued to be accomplished by the international relief organizations already established in the country. PROVIDE RELIEF was thus a limited attempt to use U.S. expertise in logistics to help the relief effort without engaging American military forces on the ground. Problems of distribution within the country continued to hamper the relief effort. In the countryside, law-less gangs seized relief supplies and used them to buy local loyalties while letting thousands starve. In the cities, the warring political factions, supported by their private armies, amassed food stockpiles as bargaining chips and signs of their power. These rival entities, often barely controlled by their clan leaders, terrorized the international organizations, stealing food and killing whoever did not pay protection money. Because of the increasingly chaotic situation on the ground, as a security measure U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers from the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, accompanied many of the relief flights. In the process they assessed the dangers of various regions, conducted a low-key reconnaissance of the airfields, and gathered basic information that would be useful for any possible future U.S. ground involvement.

  That involvement was not long in coming. Unable to explain to the world why the United States, the “sole remaining superpower” and leader of the “new world order,” was not able to stop the starvation, President Bush ordered U.S. forces to deploy to Somalia. Their mission was to ensure that relief supplies reached the people who needed them and thus to “break the cycle” of starvation and save lives.

  The operation, code-named RESTORE HOPE, began on 8 December 1992 under the direction of a Unified Task Force, or UNITAF. The I Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Pendleton, California, formed the bulk of the headquarters, with augmentation from all the services. Commanded by Marine Lt. Gen. Robert B. Johnston, UNITAF included U.S. and allied troops working together in one task force, but under U.S. and not UN direction. And, like all modern humanitarian operations, it was a joint, combined, and interagency effort. The role of the U.S. State Department was critical. Once Ambassador Robert B. Oakley was appointed as President Bush’s special envoy to Somalia, he and General Johnston moved quickly to establish a close working relationship. Although the United Nations continued to play an important part in the politics within the country, especially in the delicate negotiations between rival Somali factions, its role was soon overshadowed by U.S. military and diplomatic power. Security Council Resolution 794, passed on 3 December, endorsed the U.S.-led operation and gave it its international flavor and legitimacy, but the UN simply lacked the logistics, command and control, or intelligence capabilities to undertake such a complex mission. Marine Corps and Navy special operations elements moved into Somalia in the early morning hours of 9 December, with the first 1,300 marines coming in by helicopter directly to Mogadishu airport. Emerging from the ocean surf in the predawn hours, the Navy Seals were immediately hit with the blazing lights of forewarned media crews. Luckily, the diplomatic groundwork had been laid for U.S. troops to arrive with no Somali resistance. Thereafter, Somali warlords quickly agreed to cooperate with each other (at least for a time) and work with the U.S. troops to establish a relatively benign and secure environment. The technicals and all Somali heavy weapons began to be moved into cantonment areas by the end of the month, and by mid-February most heavy weapons were either in such secure cantonment areas or moved out of Mogadishu and hidden to avoid confiscation or destruction.

  The main challenge to the smooth flow of relief supplies continued to be the rivalry between feuding warlords, particularly between the forces of General Muhammed Farah Aideed of the Habr Gidr subclan and Ali Mahdi Mohamed of the Abgal subclan in Mogadishu. Aideed, previously a general in dictator Siad Barre’s army and a former ambassador to India, now headed the Somali National Alliance (SNA) with pretensions to ruling the entire country. His opponent, Ali Mahdi, was a former businessman and farmer with little military experience and only an ad hoc militia. Their feud had led to open conflict from November 1991 to February 1992 and only added to the tragedy of Somalia by killing thousands of innocent Mogadishu citizens. Backed by overwhelming U.S. and allied power, Ambassador Oakley effectively established a cease-fire between the two forces as a precondition to establishing a military and relief presence in the interior of the country. However, it was not in the UN charter, nor in the U.S. mission guidance, to disarm or attack either faction. Ostensibly, the UNITAF forces were neutral and there only to ensure that relief supplies flowed. They achieved this mission by late December, as the port and the airport reopened and relief supplies began moving quickly ashore. Over 40,000 tons of grain were off-loaded by the end of December along with 6,668 vehicles and 96 helicopters for the military forces. While Mogadishu maintained an uneasy calm, UNITAF forces began to move into the countryside. To aid in coordination, the southern part of the country, the area most marked by drought and famine, was divided into nine humanitarian relief sectors (HRS). U.S. Marine Forces (MARFOR) concentrated on Baardheere (Bardera) 1 and parts of Mogadishu while the U.S. Army Forces (ARFOR) of UNITAF focused on providing security, often in conjunction with allied forces, in four sectors: HRS Baidoa, HRS Balli Doogle (Baledogle), HRS Merca (Marka), and HRS Kismaayo.

  On the whole, the relief mission proceeded well, with few incidents of violence from February to May 1993. It seemed that life was assuming some measure of normalcy. Markets reopened, travel became more common, and there was even some hope of restarting a Somali national police force with promising initial results. However, clan rivalry and U.S. reluctance to engage in long-term “nation-building” operations soon doomed the effort. Troops conducted mounted and dismounted patrols throughout the cities in their sectors with occasional brushes with bandits and unruly crowds. Carefully written UNITAF Rules of Engagement (ROE) limited their responses by reminding the soldiers that this was not a wartime environment, that all persons were to be treated with dignity and respect, and that only the minimum force necessary for the mission was authorized. These ROE did not in any way, however, interfere with the right to defend oneself or one’s unit. In one instance a noncommissioned officer shot and killed a young Somali who ran up to his vehicle carrying a small box that the sergeant believed might be a bomb. Despite the tragic nature of the event, charges against the soldier were dismissed under legitimate self-defense grounds. However, in another instance, a sergeant shot and killed an individual who had stolen his sunglasses. His claim of self-defense was rejected, and he was convicted at a general court-martial. On the whole, however, U.S. Army soldiers behaved with care and restraint. By April the situation had stabilized enough that the U.S. administration determined that it was time to turn the mission over to the United Nations entirely. Despite some setbacks and incidents, Operation RESTORE HOPE succeeded in its goal of bringing an end to mass starvation. The heavily armed UNITAF units quickly established security in their sectors, and an uneasy truce kept the peace between the factions. There were some warning signs on the horizon, however, as UN diplomats began to press for a more active role of the military in confiscating weapons and in forcing some kind of political settlement. “Mission creep” began to enter the vocabulary of those serving in Somalia, and soon after the United States turned over the mission completely to the United Nations in May, the situation began to unravel.

  While U.S. and allied forces maintained the peace in Somalia, U.S. leaders were working hard to push the United Nations into establishing a new mission in Somalia to take over the majority of the responsibilities for running the relief effort while allowing the United States to reduce the size of its committed forces and handle only limited aspects of security and logistics. On 26 March 1993, the United Nations passed Resolution 814 which considerably broadened its mandate to intervene in another country’s affairs. The UN was now intervening militarily in a peacemaking role under Chapter VII of its charter. The more frequently used Chapter VI addressed only the deployment of peace-keeping troops to reinforce a previously agreed upon settlement between warring parties. But Chapter VII dealt with peace enforcement and not merely peacekeeping. The resolution underlined the charters of the first UNOSOM mission and Operation RESTORE HOPE and that of the new mission, UNOSOM II. Turkish Lt. Gen. Cevik Bir was appointed commander of the UNOSOM II force, with U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Montgomery as his deputy. General Montgomery also retained his position as commander of U.S. Forces in Somalia (USFORSOM) under Marine Corps General Joseph P. Hoar, CENTCOM commander in chief. Thus the U.S. forces retained their own national chain of command while inserting themselves into the UN structure. Only if the forces were committed to any combat operation would U.S. units fall under the tactical control (TACON) of the United Nations. Even in those circumstances, however, with the deputy commander of the UN force an American, U.S. national interests would remain protected. By October 1993 UNOSOM II consisted of over 16,000 peacekeepers from 21 nations. This number would jump to 29,732 soldiers from 29 nations by mid-November with the arrival of over 17,000 additional U.S. personnel as part of a U.S. joint task force. The slow passage of Security Council Resolution 814 left all parties with little time to plan for an orderly transition, set for 4 May. It took time to fill the UN positions for the new force and, by all accounts, the handover of the mission was poorly done with only 30 percent of the UN staff in place on the date of transfer. However, despite the challenges of transition, General Bir assumed command of forces in Somalia on 4 May 1993 as UNOSOM II assumed the mission. In support of UNOSOM II, the United States provided a substantial logistics structure (consisting of about 2,600 troops) and a small special operations element. The U.S. military also provided a 1,100-soldier ground-based quick reaction force (QRF) for UNOSOM II, consisting of a brigade-level headquarters from the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum. Jonathan Howe, a retired U.S. admiral, was appointed the new UN envoy to Somalia with wide-ranging powers.

  It quickly became apparent that Aideed had little respect for the new organization, the UN, or Admiral Howe. On 5 June 1993, his Somalia National Alliance forces ambushed and killed 24 Pakistani soldiers assigned to UNOSOM II. Another 44 were wounded. The following day, the United Nations Security Council approved Resolution 837 adopting a more aggressive military stance toward Aideed and asking member states for more troops and equipment. It also directed UNOSOM II to apprehend those responsible for the ambush. In Mogadishu, Pakistani and Italian forces conducted heavy armored patrols throughout the city, concentrating on the areas near the ambush site. Also on 6 June, General Hoar asked the Joint Staff to send four Air Force AC–130 gunships, special C–130 cargo planes modified for direct ground support, to carry out air strikes against the Somalis. The gunships deployed on 7 June and remained until 14 July, flying a total of thirty-two interdiction, reconnaissance, and PSYOP missions in support of UNOSOM II. Eight of those missions were combat sorties flown over the streets of Mogadishu between 11 and 17 June. As part of the initial strike against Aideed, three gunships flew over Mogadishu on 11–12 June and used their 105-mm. and 40-mm. cannons to demolish two weapons storage facili- ties and cripple Radio Mogadishu, Aideed’s propaganda station, by destroying its transmission capability. On 13, 14, and 17 June several additional AC–130 missions concentrated on destroying weapons storage areas and vehicle compounds belonging to Aideed and his key supporters. On 17 June, after being advised by a UN panel of jurists that Aideed and his SNA were behind the ambush of the Pakistanis, Admiral Howe issued a warrant for Aideed’s arrest and authorized a $25,000 reward. This only served to harden the political lines in Mogadishu. Skirmishing between UN and U.S. elements and Aideed’s Habr Gidr subclan continued, and on 12 July, in a direct challenge to Aideed’s leadership, the American QRF attacked a major Aideed compound with helicopter gunships. After the raid, a hostile crowd near the compound killed four western journalists covering the action, displaying their bodies for the world to see. mmediately, UNOSOM II Force Command focused its intelligence and operational capability on locating, capturing, and arresting Aideed and any of his supporters whom it deemed responsible for the attacks of June and July. On 8 August his forces detonated a mine under a passing U.S. Military Police (MP) vehicle on Jialle-Siaad Street in Mogadishu killing four U.S. MPs. As the military situation worsened, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the new U.S. administration of President William J. Clinton to assist him in capturing Aideed. On 22 August 1993, the new Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin, directed the deployment of a joint special operations task force (JSOTF) to Somalia in response to attacks made by Aideed supporters upon American and UNOSOM forces and installations. The JSOTF, named Task Force Ranger, had the mission of capturing Aideed and his key lieutenants and turning them over to UNOSOM II forces.

  In one of the most violent and costly incidents, on 8 September U.S. and Pakistani soldiers were clearing roadblocks near a site known as the Cigarette Factory when they were attacked by Somali militia using 106-mm. recoilless rifles, RPGs, and small arms. It took extensive fires from ground and aviation units to suppress the enemy fire. Later that same day, near an abandoned allied checkpoint, the same clearing element was again attacked by militiamen, this time joined by a mob of approximately 1,000 Somali civilians. Six UNOSOM II soldiers were injured. On 16 and 21 September two roadblock-clearing teams were attacked on 21 October Road. The team attacked on 21 September was a Pakistani element, and it lost an armored personnel carrier and suffered nine casualties, including two killed. On 25 September a U.S. Black Hawk helicopter was shot down and three soldiers killed. The battles of 3–4 October were a watershed in U.S. involvement in Somalia. The already complex mission and difficult environment took a dramatic turn with those events. The situation required constant innovation and rapid decisions from all the troops and commanders involved, under conditions that did not allow the American soldiers to take advantage of their great technological superiority. Experience, common sense, group cohesion, and superior tactical training were the virtues that made survival in the new environment possible as the decision-makers in Washington grappled with what to do next. In the aftermath of the 3–4 October battle, U.S. military presence in Somalia increased significantly, although temporarily. However, it soon became clear that the Clinton administration was focused on using those forces to facilitate the withdrawal of U.S. troops rather than use them to punish Aideed. General Montgomery had clear guidance: protect the force, protect the UN, and bring the force out with a minimum of casualties. In a national security policy review session held in the White House on 6 October, the president directed the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral David G. Jeremiah, to stop all actions by U.S. forces against Aideed except those required in self-defense. He also reappointed Ambassador Oakley as special envoy to Somalia in an attempt to broker a peace settlement and then announced that all U.S. forces would withdraw from Somalia no later than 31 March 1994.

  All attempts to reconcile the Somali factions had proven futile, and the international community gradually lost its patience with the total lack of political results. Operation UNITED SHIELD , the final UN withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on 3 March 1995. The United States, as part of the international community, had made major contributions to the Somalia humanitarian operations for over two years. Starvation had been stopped and hundreds of thousands of lives saved. The U.S. had accomplished much in the initial stages of the operation, but the political situation had unraveled even as the food supplies increased, allowing Somalia to slide backwards into disorder and anarchy.<sup>[[1]](https://history.army.mil/html/documents/somalia/SomaliaAAR.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Somalia.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2012, the Boston Globe made headlines claiming that the Defence Intelligence Agency confirmed that Charles Taylor, between the early 1980s and 2003, was aided by the CIA in his many war crimes. However, the Boston Globe issued a retraction to this sensational headline. They didn't know how FOIA worked. The DIA merely acknowledged it had records concerning him, not of any substance. As the paper points out, "Taylor, now standing trial before a UN special court on charges of rape, murder and other offenses, denies he was ever a source for US intelligence. The Globe had no adequate basis for asserting otherwise and the story should not have run in this form."<sup>[[1]](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2012/01/25/for-record/I6Lia8WmEGjBxd186zZccJ/story.html)</sup></sup>

- 1986 - Operation El Dorado Canyon launched lawful airstrikes against Libya, in response to a series of terrorist attacks ordered and supported by Libyan warlord and dictator, Gaddafi. Studies have found this highly successful raid resulted in a decline in Libyan-backed international terrorism. Admiral Kelso imposed strict rules of engagement to avoid or reduce the possibility of civilian casualties in the congested urban area of Tripoli, while inflicting as much damage as possible on the targets . He insisted that each airplane should have positive identification of its assigned target on multiple systems and abort its attack if weapon-guidance or navigation systems were not fully functional.<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2012/Aug/23/2001330097/-1/-1/0/Op%20El%20Dorado%20Canyon.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576109708436039?journalCode=uter20)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1722&context=jil)</sup></sup>

- Angolan civil war, 1975. The officer's revolt in Lisbon in April 1974 provided the catalyst for the political upheavals in Angola that ultimately resulted in civil war and foreign intervention. In the immediate aftermath of the Portuguese coup, Moscow took a wait-and-see attitude toward Angola while carefully monitoring events there. The first concrete Soviet involvement following the coup was the shipment of small arms to Neto's faction in the latter part of 1974. This aid was in part designed to counteract Peking's increasing material support for the MPLA's chief rival for power, the FNLA. The Angolan civil war may be said to have begun in March 1975. That month saw the first major outbreak of hostilities between competing Angolan factions since the signing of the Alvor Accord. It was also in March that the Soviet Union first became involved in the Angolan conflict in a major way by sending substantial amounts of military aid to the faction it favored. Surrounding African nations asked the US to help prevent Moscow imposing a government of its own choice on Africans. Only on July 17, US decided to make its first major investment in Angola. The first American plane carrying arms for the FNLA arrived in Zaire on July 29, and a single shipload of military supplies departed August 28, more than five months after the Soviets began sending substantial quantities of arms by sea and air. Moscow would undoubtedly have preferred to avoid such large-scale, overt involvement before November 11, the date the Portuguese had set for Angolan independence. The Soviets had undoubtedly hoped that by November 11 the MPLA would be able to declare itself the government of Angola, and request Soviet aid on an official state-to-state basis. But the November escalation shows the lengths to which the Soviets were willing to go and the risks they were willing to run to achieve their basic objective—imposition of the MPLA as the sole ruling group in Angola. As at several other stages in the crisis, Moscow was not confronted by a simple choice between military victory or defeat for its clients. A third option, which was preferred by the US, China and many African states, was still available—a coalition government representing all three liberation movements.

  US assistance to the anti-MPLA forces was limited in scope and purpose, and did not provide a major provocation for the Soviet-Cuban escalation. In all, the US during 1975 supplied 2,800 tons of military equipment valued at $31.7 million to the anti-MPLA forces, compared to the 20,000 tons valued at approximately $200 million supplied to the MPLA by Moscow and Havana. The purpose of US objectives were to create a stalemate on the battlefield, to provide leverage for diplomatic efforts to end all foreign intervention, and to seek a peaceful solution within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Beginning in October, US officials communicated these objectives to Moscow so that US intentions and actions would not be misread. In sum, the magnitude and character of the Soviet-Cuban intervention argue against the thesis that it was primarily a response to the involvement of other outside powers. The flow of weapons, advisors, and troops was disproportionate to the direct military support provided to anti-MPLA forces by Zaire and South Africa and to the indirect military assistance rendered by China and the US. Moscow and Havana brought overwhelming force to bear on their primary objective—the defeat of the FNLA-UNITA coalition and the creation of a government in Angola beholden to the Soviet Union.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000518406.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Overtime, Angolans started to view the Cubans and Soviets as "the new colonialists." Angolans frequently criticize the Cubans for being arrogant, for ignoring African sensibilities, and for monopolizing with the Soviets the few remaining luxuries in the country, where Cubans enjoy conspicuously high standards of living while Angolans experience severe shortages of food and other basic necessities. Furthermore, the Cubans and the Soviets are also being faulted for lack of economic progress and the failure to eliminate insurgency. The presence of Cuban troops in Angola, supporting the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and Angolan President Agostinho Neto, complicated efforts by the MPLA and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to end the civil war in the country. Their presence also created concerns that Cuban troops would be introduced into the conflicts in Namibia and Rhodesia. In early 1977, Carter instructed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to explore ways to improve relations with Angola and end the civil war. The issue of Cuban troops and the need to decrease their presence dominated the discussions. The administration decided upon a two-pronged approach: direct talks with the Angolans to convince them to tell the Cubans to leave and a covert propaganda operation highlighting the negative impact of Cuban presence on both Cuban and Angolan societies.<sup>[[2]](https://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1977-80v16/pdf/frus1977-80v16.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1966, the NLC, a body of a few military and police officers, overthrew President of Ghana, Nkrumah's corrupt and authoritarian regime. It established a number of committees by civilian specialists to provide guidance and expertise on political affairs and governance, and pledged (and kept its promise) to stay in power only for 2-3 years<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00826A003200100001-9.pdf#page=4)</sup></sup> after rooting out the corruption and deep Soviet, Chinese and East German intelligence service penetration.<sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017165629/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol11no3/pdf/v11i3a01p.pdf)</sup></sup> The US had no involvement in this coup, but did learn of plotting beforehand. 

- Between 1960 and 1968, the US Government engaged in overt and covert political aid, in building a stable, moderate Government in the Congo, through various Congolese administrations. Important context:  At this point, the Congo had a population of 14 million divided into over 200 ethnic groups and four major tribes, with fewer than 20 Congolese college graduates in the entire country, led by a government heavily dependent on the former Belgian colonialists to maintain infrastructure, services, and security, with an army that was poorly trained, inadequately equipped, and badly led, and a fractured political structure consisting of four semi-autonomous regions and a weak and factious “central” government in the capital of Leopoldville (Kinshasa today). The US ambassador in the early 1960s, Clare Timberlake, sympathized with the Agency officers he worked with: “Every time I look at this truly discouraging mess, I shudder over the painfully slow, frustrating and costly job ahead for the UN and US if the Congo is to really be helped. On the other hand, we can’t let go of this bull’s tail."

  These covert activities included: Support to labor unions and student groups, UN positions to favour the Government, Parliamentary manoeuvring advice, aid to leftist groups, peaceful demonstrations, etc. Once these activities concluded upon success, the CIA then engaged in a paramilitary activity to support the Government in defeating Chinese/Cuban/Russian-backed terrorists. These groups engaged in mass killings, rape, and torture. CIA provided key support to the rescue effort with the Congolese Government, and the Red Cross, to save 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by these terrorists. The terrorists executed a number of these innocent people. CIA also provided direct tactical support to UN peacekeeper operations.
It should be noted that Belgium, while not directly involved in Lumumba's death, did play a role in his arrest. "The [Belgium Parliamentary] inquiry concluded that Belgium wanted Lumumba arrested and, not being particularly concerned with his physical well-being, took no action to prevent his death even though it knew he probably would be killed. The report specifically denied that the Belgian government ordered Lumumba’s murder but that Belgian advisers to Lumumba’s enemies assisted in making it happen."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/static/b0454a75708171d0f7e59d3e63ef7a8b/CIAs-Covert-Ops-Congo.pdf)</sup></sup> CIA had no involvement in Prime Minster Patrice Lumumba's death in 1961.<sup>[[2]](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Yugoslav Wars
Due to the overlap and proximity of these conflicts, I've addressed them in a narrative format, quoting exclusively from Historians, legal scholars and independent investigations.

### Kosovo War (1998–1999)

#### Overview 

- With Tito's death in 1980, the relative calm that had pervaded Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end as ethnic and nationalist differences flared up yet again. Initially, Kosovar Albanians rioted in 1981 over poor living, economic, and educational conditions. Pristina University became a "hotbed of Albanian nationalism," and another mass exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo followed anti-Serb riots by the Albanian population. In response, Serbian anger continued to increase as Serbs now saw themselves as the aggrieved, disadvantaged party. By 1987, swelling Serbian resentment led to massive protest marches and rallies, paving the way for Slobodan Milosevic,106 who surged to power on a platform of radical Serb nationalism. Milosevic's first guarantee was that he would protect ethnic Serbs from abuse in Kosovo. He then had the Serbian government outlaw school instruction in the Albanian language. In 1989, he succeeded in completely stripping Kosovo of its autonomy108 and sent in the Serbian Army and Serbian police units to maintain order and discipline after rioting occurred in response to the constitutional amendments revoking Kosovo autonomy. From 1989 through late 1992, Milosevic effectively enforced a state of emergency in Kosovo, in which Serbian "security" forces suppressed Albanian media, language education, protests, and strikes.

  Kosovo and other Yugoslav republics evinced strong concerns over Milosevic's actions in short order. Albanian legislators met secretly in 1990, declared the Republic of Kosovo to be in existence, and created a "shadow" Kosovo government—the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK)—led by Dr. Ibrahim Rugova. In an effort to avoid being similarly swept up in Milosevic's centralization and nationalistic policies, first Slovenia, in 1990, and then Croatia, in 1991, declared independence from Yugoslavia. Milosevic responded by sending Yugoslav tanks into Slovenia. As a result, Yugoslavia effectively ceased to exist as of 27 June 1991. By 1992 the situation within the region had deteriorated drastically. The Communist world in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe had collapsed and the call for revolution continued to drift across southern Europe and the Yugoslav republics. Already in dire straits as the result of a massive debt and triple-digit inflation and heavily dependent on Western aid, the Yugoslav economy bordered on collapse with the advent of an international economic embargo in late 1991 against Serbia and Montenegro. Slovenia had already achieved independence, and the bloody slugfest within Croatia continued. Macedonia declared independence in January 1992, and Bosnia and Herzegovina followed suit in March 1992. However, this declaration of Bosnian independence from Yugoslavia led only to a violent struggle between the Bosnian Serbs, supported by Serbia, and the Bosnian Muslims. The Serbs sought to divide the country along ethnic lines and unite with a "Greater Serbia." In the midst of all of this, Serbia and Montenegro joined together to form the new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992, with Milosevic at the helm. On one side of the Bosnian conflict were the Bosnian Serbs, led by Premiere Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, and the "Chetniks." They both had the support of Yugoslav National Army (JNA) units, and were intent on eradicating the Muslim population through terror tactics and a vicious ethnic cleansing program. Pitted against them were the Bosnian Muslims, who were merely attempting to hold on to as much territory as possible. To further complicate matters, however, the Bosnian Croats were also seeking to obtain Bosnian land for Croatia and were attacking Bosnian Muslims as well.

  During 1998, a full-fledged civil war opened up between Serbia and Kosovo. In the battles between Serb military and police forces and the KLA, thousands died and hundreds of thousands sought refuge elsewhere. Kosovo quickly became the foremost concern of the international community, posing grave humanitarian concerns and risking spillover into neighboring countries, which needed little to fan the existing embers of ethnic hatred and violence. A six-country "Contact Group" formed and initially called for negotiations on autonomy in place of armed conflict. Buttressed by internal support for his policies, Milosevic rejected the calls for Serbia to cease all military action in Kosovo. Instead, Milosevic sent more troops into Kosovo and escalated the level of fighting during the summer months of 1998. In response, the North Atlantic Council (NAC)130 asked NATO to explore and assess numerous military options to end the crisis in Kosovo.

 
  A January 2000 Report to Congress finds, "The Ushtria Clirimtare E Kosoves (UCK), or the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), was formed in the early 1990s with the goal of using force to create an independent Kosovo and, ultimately, a "Greater Albania* that would unite ethnic Albanians in Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. A secretive organization with access to light infantry weapons and small amounts of explosives, the UCK in 1996 launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and hit and-run attacks against Serb government facilities and personnel, as well as ethnic Albanians it suspected of collaboration with Serb authorities. The former UCK leadership continues to call for the independence of Kosovo. During the war, the leadership ceased public calls for a "Greater Albania." Beyond independence and economic reconstruction, the former UCK leadership has revealed little of its political platform. Further, neither the US, nor NATO, provided support to the KLA/UCK.

  UCK attacks had only a limited impact on Serb forces in Kosovo, and the group. remained a marginal force in the Kosovo Albanian autonomy movement. However, the deaths of 80 Kosovo Albanians, including many women and children, during a March 1998 raid by Serb security forces on a suspected UCK compound in central Kosovo galvanized support for armed resistance among ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the diaspora. The UCK seized the leadership of the growing insurgency and expanded quickly in the following months-in part due to the ready availability of large numbers of weapons and military equipment looted from Albanian Army stores during the previous year and a willingness of Kosovo Albanians to volunteer for service. Despite its growing strength, the UCK was unable to counter the Yugoslav Army offensive that started in March 1999. UCK units attempted to defend villages and protect ethnic Albanian civilians throughout Kosovo, but were overwhelmed by the Serbs' superior firepower. The deployment of international military forces into Kosovo in June 1999, however, brought an end to the fighting. The UCK agreed to demilitarize and transform into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), a non-military organization with civil defense duties, such as emergency rescue and disaster relief. KFOR officials in late August certified the UCK was compliant with the demilitarization requirements, and the UCK officially disbanded in late September 1999.

  The UCK leadership does not appear to have engaged in narcotics operations to support its activities during the war. Press reporting of various degrees of reliability indicates that some members of the former UCK are involved in narcotics smuggling, but we have no information on the scale of these activities. The UCK was not involved in terrorist activities-defined as premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets. We do not have a definitive count of the number of noncombatant civilians killed by the UCK since its formation. The UCK primarily targeted Serb government personnel and facilities, as well as ethnic Albanians who were suspected of collaborating with Serb authorities. However, press reports suggest that some UCK members have been involved in intimidation attacks and retribution killings since Serb forces withdrew from the province in June 1999."

  In addition, Scholars have concluded, "all available evidence refutes the proposition aggressively advanced by the Milosevic regime that the KLA was mainly financed by drug and prostitution money."<sup>[[1]](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=c033421)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/report-on-kla)</sup></sup>

  Amid the unearthing of evidence of additional massacres and the continued rejection of peace overtures by Milosevic, the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution (UNSCR) 1199 on 23 September 1998. The resolution called for an immediate cease-fire, an international presence, and the immediate withdrawal of Serbian troops from within Kosovo. Although the Serbs thereafter claimed to have complied, at least in part, the Contact Group observed no evidence of such compliance. Thus, while the Contact Group sent U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and others to Belgrade to obtain Milosevic's assurances of future compliance with the terms of the resolution, on 13 October 1998 NATO authorized air strikes in the event that Milosevic ultimately failed to comply.

  The Serb massacre of forty-five Albanians in the village of Racak on 15 January 1999 forced the international community’s hand once again. NATO issued a "solemn warning" to both sides that it would resort to military force immediately if they did not again heed the terms of the cease fire. In an effort to settle the rising tension, the Contact Group announced a peace conference in Rambouillet, France, near Paris, on 6 February 1999. The warring parties received Western-drafted proposals on how to resolve the ongoing conflict and were "provided" a deadline by which they were to agree to the proposals. Although the Serbs initially expressed a willingness to discuss the proposal's terms, they reneged at subsequent meetings held in Paris in mid-March. As a result, the negotiations ended, the violence in Kosovo intensified, the KVM withdrew, and NATO once again threatened a strong military response. On 22 March, Holbrooke attempted a "last-ditch" effort to convince Milosevic to sign the agreement and prevent a military confrontation. The international community hoped to avoid air strikes but nonetheless continued to plan them. However, Holbrooke’s efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. On 24 March, NATO forces began a campaign of air strikes—code-named Operation Allied Force—against FRY military targets to force the Serbs to cease hostilities and allow ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes in Kosovo.

  Finally, on 3 June, Milosevic and the Serbian National Assembly accepted a peace plan that arose out of negotiations initiated by Russian Special Envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin. On 10 June, after having received confirmation from SACEUR that Serb forces were withdrawing from Kosovo pursuant to the terms of a NATO–FRY Military-Technical Agreement (MTA) dated 9 June, NATO officially halted the air strikes. Also on 10 June, the UNSC passed UNSCR 1244, which welcomed the FRY's acceptance of the "principles on a political solution to the Kosovo crisis" and demanded the FRY's "full cooperation in their rapid implementation." Although 10 June brought an end to the military campaign, significant events occurred during the two-plus months of NATO military action. One week after the start of the campaign, the crisis in the region escalated when on 31 March Serbs captured three U.S. soldiers patrolling the FRY-FYROM border. In April 1999 Serb troops were responsible for the massacre of atl east forty-seven Albanian men, and the forced departure of thousands more, from the town of Djakovica. In response, NATO intensified its campaign of air strikes, bombing roads, bridges, oil production facilities, and other significant targets in the FRY.

  On 27 May 1999 the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) unsealed an indictment accusing Milosevic and four other senior Yugoslav officials of committing numerous war crimes in Kosovo. In passing UNSCR 1244, the UNSC formally declared its adoption of the general principles upon which the political solution to the Kosovo crisis would be based and announced its decision to deploy an international civil presence and an international security presence under UN auspices within Kosovo. The international civil presence was entitled the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),and the international security presence was known as KFOR. On 12 June, synchronized with the departure of the FRY forces, the initial elements of KFOR rolled into Kosovo. This almost 50,000-member international force was to assume the critical peacekeeping mission in Kosovo—code-named Operation Joint Guardian. The U.S. contribution to this force, "Task Force Falcon," operated within one of the five multinational brigades within Kosovo that comprised KFOR—the Multinational Brigade East (MNB(E)), located in southeast Kosovo, bordering the FYROM and the FRY. By 20 June 1999 a majority of the FRY forces had vacated Kosovo, KFOR was well established, and NATO had formally terminated the air campaign.

  Montenegro discussed separating from the FRY. Milosevic's popularity with many Serbs began to plummet over the loss of Kosovo. On 24 September 2000, elections were held in the FRY and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica emerged as the victor. Milosevic refused to release the complete results, however, and instead demanded a runoff election against Kostunica. In response to Milosevic's refusal to step down, massive public protests and demonstrations took place within Serbia. A general strike was called, and over one million people flooded Belgrade, ultimately attacking the Parliament building. Serb security forces either joined the demonstrators or retreated. On 5 October 2000, Milosevic finally conceded the election and stepped down. His Socialist Party, still maintaining a degree of political power, agreed to share power with two opposition parties. Yet after thirteen cruel years and four more Balkan wars, Milosevic's reign had finally come to a close.<sup>[[3]](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/Lessons-Learned_Kosovo/Lessons-Learned_Kosovo.pdf)</sup></sup>

#### NATO targeting/ROE

- To quote at length from Tony Montgomery, Deputy Staff Judge Advocate and Chief, Operations Law at Headquarters EUCOM—on the targeting process:

  "Once the air campaign began, a daily list of proposed new targets (or targets that had been previously reviewed, but additional information had been obtained on) was provided to those working within the targeting group. All target nominations were maintained on a spreadsheet that was electronically updated and available for review on a classified website. I would review the information on the new targets using this list.
Early and unfettered access to data is critical for an effective and efficient target review. During Operation Allied Force, target data was stored on and accessed through our classified computer system. Those with access to the system had the ability to have most of the data on any individual target available for review with just a few keystrokes and mouse clicks. This information consisted of imagery, descriptions of the facility and its functions, analysis on impact (military advantage anticipated) if destroyed, possible collateral damage concerns, and historical information on the target. There, literally at my fingertips, was all the data needed to make a good initial legal evaluation of the target.
The results of the legal reviews were inputted into the targeting process using two primary methods. A spreadsheet format that was provided to those working within the targeting group and updated as new targets were proposed. This spreadsheet contained the target identification information, collateral damage concerns, justification for attack, and a law of war determination or recommendation. This method ensured a permanent record for each target reviewed and provided an easy means of recalling inputs on each target.

  The second method of input was through the collaborative targeting (CTT) sessions. These sessions were an outgrowth of Serbia's failure to acquiesce as quickly as some had hoped would happen. Continuing the conflict translated into a demand for more and better targets, and faster identification. Increasing the pace of target development meant, in part, more people devoted to the task. Throwing more people into the mix initially created additional problems. Groups worked and coordinated target products in a serial fashion. One group would forward its work as e-mail attachments, message traffic, fax, and or phone calls to others with responsibility for different portions of the process. The next group would make changes and forward (or, depending on the changes, return to the first group for reconsideration) to other groups involved in the process. This process continued until the lead group believed the proposed target was ready for decision-maker review. Decision-makers would receive an e-mail with the attached product information and would either accept the product information or send it back for further development.
The disadvantages of this early process were information overload, uncer-tainty, and duplication of effort. Using a serial workflow extended the process timeline and provided more opportunities for confusion, ambiguities and er-rors. There was no consensus among the participants on the rationale for attacking targets. While no illegal targets were attacked during this period, others and myself were concerned that as the tempo increased our ability to provide the necessary oversight would continue to degrade.

  The solution to this serial process was the development of the collaborative targeting sessions. The CTT sessions ensured all targeting organizations had a common understanding of objectives and guidance, built consensus, validated targeting assessments and integrated operational and legal concerns early into the targeting process. Using NetMeeting, a Microsoft product, on the classified internet system, the sessions "virtually" united representatives from commands throughout the theatre and the United States. Similar in concept and format to an internet "chat room" conducted over our classified computer sys-tem, these sessions brought all of the players into the same "virtual" room at the same time. All participants could see the proposed target on their computer monitor, could talk via headsets in real time to each other, and could ask questions and resolve issues. This format enabled everyone's input--in-cluding legal-to get to all those involved at the same time. With all the relevant functional experts gathered together, questions could be asked and resolutions made in minutes rather than days. What might have taken a week before could be done in one night's session. Collaborative targeting sessions were generally conducted every night.

  During a CTT session, the group reviewed proposed targets to determine whether they could be forwarded for approval. For each target, discussion revolved around three issues: 1) the linkage to military effects--the key to gaining legal approval, 2) the collateral damage estimate, and 3) the unintended civilian casualty estimate. The one aspect of this process that consumed most of the time was the collateral damage estimate. Whether it was the nature of the conflict, an outgrowth of the ever increasing visibility of the results of military actions, over sensitivity by political authorities, the desire to make a decision based on some objective "number" (no matter how unscientifically reached or misunderstood) rather than a subjective "value," or a combination of the above, the collateral damage estimate quickly became central to much of the targeting process. An integral part of this estimate was the Tier System. The Tier System was developed prior to Operation Allied Force as an effort to standardize the methodology to be used for estimating collateral damage. Though some aspects of this methodology are classified, the unclassified information provides a general understanding. The system currently has four tiers or levels. Each tier represents an ever-increasing level of analysis. Tier 1 consists of a 1500-foot circle drawn around the outer boundary of a proposed tar-get. If there is no collateral damage concern within that circle, then there is no need to move on to the next tier. Tier 2 involves applying fragmentation data of a specific munition to the actual target. This results in a smaller circle being drawn around the target. If a collateral damage concern still exists, then Tier 3 is used. This involves taking a specific munition, applying its record of accu-racy, along with the possibility of error, and determining the probable or possible extent of collateral damage. Finally, if the level of possible collateral damage is still viewed as unacceptable; and the target in question is deemed of sufficient value, then a Tier 4 analysis, involving computer simulation and modeling can be conducted.

  Here is an illustrative analogy: Tier 1 is like looking at an object with the naked eye, Tier 2 is like using a hand held magnifying glass, Tier 3 is like using a microscope, while Tier 4 is like using a high-powered electron microscope. The tier system is a useful tool that provides a methodology for evaluating the structural collateral damage and possible effects upon any human within the target area. However, it does not provide the actual number of injuries. Also,, just because a target is Tier 1 or Tier 4 does not tell the reviewer anything about the actual value of striking that target within the context of the ongoing campaign. Whether or not destroying a particular target is going to achieve the stated military or political objective is not a part of the tier system analysis. A target may have zero possibility of collateral damage, but if it also has zero impact on the campaign, then bombing that target is wasting resources, putting aircrews and civilians in danger, and possibly violating the law of war. Still, it is very tempting to point to the tier level of some target and make a value judgment solely on those criteria. Returning to the target approval process, once a collaborative targeting session approved a target, it was sent forward to the decision authority. Obtaining approval from both the appropriate authorities within the United States and NATO was required before any target could be attacked. (Note that as I was not involved in the NATO process, my discussions are focused exclusively on the US process.) Upon this final approval, the Joint Task Force (TF) could add the target to the master list and schedule it for attack. However, approval to strike meant much more than just satisfying the rather low thresholds set out by the law of war. The intense concern over the issue of collateral damage meant that targets were approved for strike only at a certain tier level. To achieve that level often meant that only a certain type of munition could be used or the target could only be attacked at certain times of the day. Thus, something as simple as a change in munition could raise the level of collateral damage above what had been approved and, thus, remove a target from the "approved for strike" category.

  As a result, though not listed as an official step in the targeting process, reviewing the daily list of proposed strikes for the next two days became a part of the process. This review was simply a quality check-not because people would intentionally ignore orders, but because people enter the data into the computers, people hit the wrong keys and people make mistakes. A single wrong entry or a miscommunication to the personnel who actually had to execute the mission could mean an attack occurring that had not been approved. This is not saying that a law of war violation would occur, just that a target would be struck in a manner that our civilian authorities had not authorized. In contrast to the hi-tech world of the collaborative targeting sessions, this review was a simple line-by-line comparison of the strike list to the approved target list and the legal review. Usually, this review found no discrepancies; however, on occasion targets listed as approved for attack had not yet been approved at the appropriate level or were being attacked with a munition that raised the possible collateral damage above that approved for the target. When such discrepancies were found, the target would be expedited through the approval process if possible, or the munition would be changed to bring the collateral damage estimate back down. Sometimes this necessitated canceling a strike. After this quality review, the proposed new list of targets would arrive and the process would begin for another day."<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/legalethicalless78wall/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

#### Alleged NATO war crime examples

- A 2000 report, by the UNEP and IAEA experts, examined Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions use in the Balkans found: There was no detectable, widespread contamination of the ground surface by depleted uranium. This means that any widespread contamination is present in such low levels that it cannot be detected or differentiated from the natural uranium concentration found in rocks and soil. The corresponding radiological and toxicological risks are insignificant and even non-existent.

  Detectable ground surface contamination by DU is limited to areas within a few metres of penetrators and localised points of concentrated contamination (‘contamination points’) caused by penetrator impacts. A number of contamination points were identified by the mission but most of these were found to be only slightly contaminated. The majority of the radioactivity was attached to the surrounding asphalt, concrete or soil, with some attached to the loose sand present in some penetrator holes. In many cases, the radioactivity was so low that it was hardly detectable."

  There is no significant risk related to these contamination points in terms of possible contamination of air, water or plants. The only risk of any significance would be that someone touched the contamination point, thereby contaminating their hands (with a risk of subsequent transfer to the mouth), or directly ingested the contaminated soil. However, with reasonable assumptions on intake of soil, the corresponding radiological risk would be insignificant, while from a toxicological point of view, the possible intake might be somewhat higher than the applicable health standards." No DU-contaminated water, milk, objects, or buildings were found."<sup>[[5]](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/finalreport.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On May 7, 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, it was alleged that the US deliberately targeted the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. This was not the case. In summary, there were several crucial errors which led to the Chinese Embassy being struck: There was an error in locating the target. The approach used to attempt to locate the FDSP building was severely flawed. All sources of information used to prevent precisely this type of accident were either inaccurate or incomplete. The review process did not catch the locational error and did not consult any material or any person which could have provided correct information. There was in the immediate aftermath of the bombing some confusion as to what had happened and some of our early public statements were confused and contradictory. To summarize clearly and precisely: the attack on the PRC Embassy was the result of a series of errors that led to the destruction of the PRC Embassy instead of the Serb military target that was intended. The use of a map containing an error--the inaccurate location of the Chinese Embassy--contributed to the tragic mistake--but this was not due solely to a "map error." What went wrong was, first and foremost, that the approach used to locate the Bulevar Umetnosti 2, the address of the FDSP, was severely flawed. Second, the databases used to check and prevent this type of targeting error were also inaccurate, incomplete, and not fully independent. And third, the target review process did not detect the first two mistakes, nor did it involve people and information that could have provided additional data to correct or detect these errors.<sup>[[6]](https://1997-2001.state.gov/policy_remarks/1999/990617_pickering_emb.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001081870.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://irp.fas.org/congress/1999_hr/990722-hamre.htm)</sup></sup> ICTY agreed with these findings, and found no war crime had occurred. ICTY examined a number of high-profile incidents:

  - Grdelica train bombing is not a war crime. Per the independent findings of ICTY, "62. It is the opinion of the committee that the bridge was a legitimate military objective. The passenger train was not deliberately targeted. The person controlling the bombs, pilot or WSO, targeted the bridge and, over a very short period of time, failed to recognize the arrival of the train while the first bomb was in flight. The train was on the bridge when the bridge was targeted a second time and the bridge length has been estimated at 50 meters (Wenz study para 6 g above at p.25). It is the opinion of the committee that the information in relation to the attack with the first bomb does not provide a sufficient basis to initiate an investigation. The committee has divided views concerning the attack with the second bomb in relation to whether there was an element of recklessness in the conduct of the pilot or WSO. Despite this, the committee is in agreement that, based on the criteria for initiating an investigation (see para. 5 above), this incident should not be investigated. In relation to whether there is information warranting consideration of command responsibility, the committee is of the view that there is no information from which to conclude that an investigation is necessary into the criminal responsibility of persons higher in the chain of command."

  - The Attack on the Djakovica Convoy on 14/4/99, ICTY finds, "It is the opinion of the committee that civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident. While there is nothing unlawful about operating at a height above Yugoslav air defences, it is difficult for any aircrew operating an aircraft flying at several hundred miles an hour and at a substantial height to distinguish between military and civilian vehicles in a convoy. In this case, most of the attacking aircraft were F16s with a crew of one person to fly the aircraft and identify the target. As soon as the crews of the attacking aircraft became aware of the presence of civilians, the attack ceased."

  - Further, "NATO intentionally bombed the Radio and TV station and the persons killed or injured were civilians. The questions are: was the station a legitimate military objective and; if it was, were the civilian casualties disproportionate to the military advantage gained by the attack? For the station to be a military objective within the definition in Article 52 of Protocol I: a) its nature, purpose or use must make an effective contribution to military action and b) its total or partial destruction must offer a definite military advantage in the circumstances ruling at the time. The 1956 ICRC list of military objectives, drafted before the Additional Protocols, included the installations of broadcasting and television stations of fundamental military importance as military objectives (para. 39 above). The list prepared by Major General Rogers included broadcasting and television stations if they meet the military objective criteria (para. 38 above). As indicated in paras. 72 and 73 above, the attack appears to have been justified by NATO as part of a more general attack aimed at disrupting the FRY Command, Control and Communications network, the nerve centre and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power, and also as an attempt to dismantle the FRY propaganda machinery. Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable."<sup>[[9]](https://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal)</sup></sup>

### Bosnian War (1992–1995)

#### 1991-1992: War Erupts and the international reaction:

- In June 1991, simmering ethnic tensions within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia came to a peak after the legislatures of Slovenia and Croatia voted overwhelmingly to declare their independence. As an immediate response to their secessions, the Yugoslav government issued a statement claiming such declarations to be "illegal" and "illegitimate" and ordered its military to secure their borders. Two days later, the national Yugoslav People's Army ("JNA"), whose Commander and a majority of whose soldiers were Serbian, responded with force and invaded Slovenia to prevent its separation, but the JNA was met with strong resistance. In Croatia, fighting erupted between Croatian security forces and minority Serb irregulars, who had the backing of the JNA. The Croatian forces quickly lost an estimated one- third of the country to the Serb insurgents. Each of the warring factions, the Serbs, Bosnian Serbs and later the Bosnian Croats, declared regions of territory as "ethnically pure, autonomous" areas under their control, and fiercely fought to protect and expand their holdings.

  In response to the civil unrest in Yugoslavia, the European Community ("EC") convened an emergency meeting of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe ("CSCE"). The CSCE urged the warring factions to accept a cease-fire and sent observers to Yugoslavia to monitor their compliance and troop movement. However, throughout the summer of 1991, while cease-fires were negotiated, signed, and violated, the JNA continued to launch military offensives in Croatia.

  In its third meeting on this subject, the CSCE passed a resolution calling for the imposition of an aims embargo against all parties to the conflict. On September 25, 1991, the Bush Administration, on behalf of the United States, supported the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 713 ("UNSC Res. 713"). The resolution imposed a complete embargo on all weapons and equipment deliveries to the former Yugoslavia—including Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 724, to establish a Sanctions Committee that would monitor compliance with the embargo. Resolution 713, in concert with United National Security Council Resolutions 740 and 787 which addressed the implementation of the embargo, called on all nations to abide by the embargo, but did not legally require countries to enforce the embargo.

  The United Nations arms embargo was intended to contain the war and prevent the entry of additional countries into the conflict. One of the consequences of the embargo, however, was the preservation of Serbian military superiority over the other republics due to the Serbs' alliance with the JNA and the extensive supply of equipment and munitions within the JNA arsenal. Throughout 1991, the JNA continued to attack various Croatian cities. In Zagreb, governmental buildings, including President Tudjman's office, were shelled. In the coastal town of Dubrovnik, the JNA cut off the power and water supplies, and severed telephone links for weeks at a time. In November, the Serbian forces finally left Vukovar, a city of 45,000, in ruins after months of fighting. The first United Nations-sponsored cease-fire went into effect on November 23, 1991 but quickly collapsed, as intense fighting continued elsewhere in Croatia. In January, 1992 the first European Community casualties were reported. Five military observers sent by the CSCE were shot down in their marked helicopter. From this moment, it was evident that a larger international presence was needed to maintain peace in the region. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations sent a team to Croatia to lay the groundwork for the deployment of international peacekeeping troops. With United States support, the passage of United Nations Resolution 743 authorized the establishment of the 14,000-strong United Nations Protection Force ("UNPROFOR") for an initial service of twelve months. The troops were composed of platoons from many nations including Great Britain, France, Canada, Egypt, Malaysia and the Russian Federation and were dispatched throughout the region in areas of heavy fighting and relative calm.

#### 1992-1993: Bosnia Enters the War:

- In early 1992, the battle lines expanded into the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In April, Serb militiamen and the Yugoslav Army launched attacks against Bosnian Government forces after Bosnia became the third country to declare its independence from Yugoslavia. The most ethnically diverse of the former Yugoslav states, Bosnia had been a melting pot of Serbs, Croats and Muslims. Although the Bosnian Government's predominantly Muslim army was larger than the Bosnian Serb Army ("BSA"), the alliance between the Bosnian Serbs and the JNA tipped the balance of firepower heavily in favor of the BSA, which quickly seized more than two-thirds of the territory and surrounded the capital city of Sarajevo. In fact, after the Bosnian Serb Army invaded Sarajevo on May 2, 1992, the front-lines in the Sarajevo suburbs established by the BSA partitioned the city and held on for the rest of the war. The tremendous disparity in weapons is described in a New York Times article that noted: "[T]he Serbian forces in Bosnia have 300 tanks and the Bosnian Muslims just 2. The Serbian forces have 200 armored persoruiel carriers and the Muslims 1 or 2. The Serbian forces have 600 to 800 artillery pieces to two dozen in the hands of the Muslims."


  As these numbers would suggest, Serb forces easily outgunned the Bosnian Muslims, quickly acquired vast expanses of territory and inflicted high numbers of civilian casualties. Unlike the other warring factions whose patrons in Croatia and Serbia provided them with military and financial support, the Bosnian Muslims were forced to look beyond their immediate borders to acquire arms and other support. Despite the international arms embargo, the Bosnian Government forces acquired some small arms by various means including purchasing arms on the international grey market, receiving smuggled weapons from private humanitarian aid organizations, producing some small arms, and receiving clandestine shipments of weapons via an arms pipeline through Croatia. Other countries came to the aid of the Muslims: Turkey and Pakistan smuggled small arms to the Bosnian Muslims; the Sultan of Brunei paid for a shipment of antitank missiles from Malaysia; and Saudi Arabia donated funds to the Bosnian Government to purchase arms from Hungary and Argentina. The materials acquired by the Bosnian Muslims in the early years of the war, however, did little to sustain the troops or mount a strong opposition against the Serb forces. Bosnian President Izetbegovic called upon the United Nations on several occasions to lift the arms embargo and allow his forces access to heavy weapons to defend themselves, but his efforts were unsuccessful.

  The violence escalated during the spring of 1992. Although cease-fires had been negotiated and signed, none had held successfully. Beginning in 1992, successive diplomatic initiatives sponsored by the United Nations and the European Union were rejected. Numerous cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina including Mostar, Gorazde and Sarajevo came under heavy attack from the Bosnian Serb forces, killing many, trapping United Nations peacekeepers, and making the delivery of humanitarian aid nearly impossible. In May, under international pressure and the threat of Western sanctions, the Yugoslav Army announced its withdrawal from the conflict but allowed its soldiers who were bom in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain and fight with their weapons and equipment, thus further solidifying the superiority and military strength of the Bosnian Serbs. In June, Serbian militia forces fiercely attacked Sarajevo, deploying rockets, mortars, and artillery. In July, an international airlift to provide food, medicine and relief supplies to the starving citizens in Sarajevo began. Despite the reported offenses by all factions, in April of 1992 the European Community and the United States formally recognized the countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, and lifted the economic sanctions imposed upon them. In May, these countries gained admission to the United Nations. On May 30, 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed sweeping economic sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ("FRY"), now consisting solely of Serbia and Montenegro, for its role in promoting the creation of an autonomous Serb state and supporting Serbian guerrilla forces, federal Yugoslav army units and the Bosnian Serb Army. Almost one year later in April 1993, these sanctions were further tightened by the United Nations Security Council which banned the transshipment of goods through Serbia and Montenegro and froze financial assets abroad.

  In the summer of 1992, incidents of ethnic cleansing were widely reported. In the northeast Bosnian city of Brcko, Serb forces systematically executed Muslim men in the prison camp of Luka. Inmates were selected to be interrogated, beaten and killed almost every day over a two week period. In Bosanski Samac, Serb military forces overran the city and carried out an orchestrated campaign of terror to force Bosnian Croat and Muslim residents to leave the area. Detention centers and prisoner of war camps also were uncovered. Prisoners freed from the camps described them as places where "beatings and torture are an integral part of the daily regime" and venues of "executions, mass deportations in closed freight cars, forced marches and a regime of starvation and abandonment to the elements." President Izetbegovic charged that Bosnian Muslims were the victims of "genocide" and implored the world community to defend their freedom and their ability to defend themselves as its "duty."  Increasingly, Islamic nations complained that the tepid response against the Serb aggressions by the United Nations and western countries condoned the persecution of Muslims. The forty-seven countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference ("OIC") were naturally sympathetic toward the Bosnian Muslims. The OIC members also were bound by the United  Nations arms embargo, although their degree of adherence to the embargo varied. In December, 1992. the OIC passed a declaration calling for the lifting of the arms embargo. President Izetbegovic responded to outpourings of support from the Islamic community with public accolades and declared that "we consider Iran as our greatest friend in the world." The American public was increasingly sympathetic to efforts to aims the Bosnian Muslims and neither the Bush Administration nor Members of Congress condemned Izetbegovic for expressing such views about Iran. Iran views itself as the "protector of oppressed Muslims worldwide" and was particularly active in its support of the Bosnian Government forces. Beginning in 1992, began implementing plans to send diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian assistance to the Bosnian Muslims to make up for the inability of the United Nations to intervene on behalf of the Bosnian Muslims. Additionally, Iran supplied clandestine military aid and personnel to the Bosnian Government Army.

  In September 1992, western news and Croatian government sources reported the first substantial leak and "one of the most brazen efforts yet to circumvent the arms embargo. An Iranian Boeing 747 had secretly landed in Zagreb, Croatia, carrying more than 4,000 guns; more than one million rounds of ammunition; and forty Iranians in an apparent attempt by the Islamic state to smuggle weapons to Muslim forces. The Iranian 747 flights appeared to confirm rumors that Iran and other Islamic countries had been involved in providing weapons and aid to the Bosnian Muslims in violation of the arms embargo. Although the Muslim forces were desperate for weapons, President Bush responded to the report of the Iranian weapons delivery by officially protesting to Croatia and the Croatian Government impounded the aims. Secretary of State Eagleburger recalled, "We made it very clear that we were adamantly opposed to this going on." U.S. Department of State officials condemned Iran's attempt to skirt the United Nations arms embargo, but acknowledged that previous Iranian flights also may have included illegal arms shipments.

  On 9 October 1992, UN Security Council passed resolution 781, which prohibited unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone, but it did not take action against violators of the resolution. In response to over 500 documented violations, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures "to ensure compliance" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. NATO's Operation Deny Flight, which lasted from April 12, 1993 to Dec 20, 1995, enforced this UNSCR compliance.<sup>[[10]](https://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/459001/operation-deny-flight/)</sup></sup>

#### 1993-1994: Clinton's Bosnian Policy and the Muslim-Croat War:

- During the 1992 Presidential campaign. President Clinton criticized President Bush for taking little action to support the Bosnian Muslims. President Clinton publicly opposed the arms embargo and argued the United States should do more, including conducting air strikes, to protect Bosnia. Once elected, however, Clinton's foreign policy to aid the Bosnian Muslims was constrained diplomatically and militarily. President Clinton faced strong resistance to multilaterally lifting the arms embargo from the European allies, particularly Great Britain and France which feared that a retaliatory strike by the Bosnian Serbs would endanger their troops on the ground. In the absence of necessary international support for a multilateral lift of the embargo. Congress supported a unilateral lift to allow the United States to supply weapons directly to the Muslims. However, the allies opposed unilateral action by the United States vigorously. The Administration shared the allies' opposition to unilateral action out of concern that any Serb retaliation would endanger UNPROFOR troops, that our allies would withdraw their troops, and because unilateral action by the United States would be a direct violation of the international arms embargo. The Administration was concerned about an adverse effect unilateral action would have on the adherence to and the success of other embargoes against Iraq, Libya, and North Korea.


  In early 1993, the Clinton Administration supported a comprehensive peace settlement (the "Vance-Owen plan") sponsored by the two Chairmen of the Peace Conference on former Yugoslavia, United Nations envoy Cyrus Vance and European Community mediator Lord David Owen. The Vance-Owen plan would apportion Bosnia into ten provinces, primarily defined along ethnic lines. The plan would create ten separate provinces, of which three would be defined by a Serb majority, three would have a Muslim majority, two would have a Croat majority, one would be a Croat-Muslim province, and the tenth would be the city of Sarajevo, which would retain a presence of all ethnicities. Throughout the first months of 1993, the two mediators negotiated with the leaders of each warring faction to gamer support for the peace settlement. The Serbs rejected the plan because it required them to return some Muslim pockets of territory they had already conquered and because the Serb provinces would be isolated from each other. Bosnian President Izetbegovic criticized the plan for imposing ethnic partitions across Bosnia, although he felt pressure to accept the plan to gain international approval. In contrast to the other factions, the Croats supported the plan because it fulfilled their objective of creating autonomous Croat provinces that adjoined Croatia and extended into Bosnia. The Bosnian Serb Assembly voted to reject the plan and it lost the support of the United States for several reasons: first, the United States feared that the plan, if adopted, would be unenforceable; second the Bosnian Government continued to strongly criticize the plan; and third, it would have required 50,000 ground troops to enforce and the United States  maintained its reluctance to send peacekeeping troops from the United States armed forces into the region. After abandoning its support for the Vance-Owen plan. President Clinton looked for other ways to support a multi-ethnic state in Bosnia.

  During his first six months in office, President Clinton worked to establish a more active Bosnian policy. In June, Secretary of State Christopher announced the first commitment of United States peacekeeping ground forces to the war, offering 300 United States troops for the UNPROFOR force in Macedonia. The President also worked successfully within the international arena to urge the North Atlantic Council to employ "stronger measures including air strikes" against Bosnian Serb forces (action the NATO Council endorsed). Preparations for the use of NATO air power began immediately after the endorsement. In late April 1993, increasing tensions between the Bosnian Muslims and the Croats erupted into violence. For almost one full year, the Bosnian Muslims found themselves waging wars on two fronts. Ethnic tensions, an influx of refugees who had been "ethnically cleansed" from other cities, and the proximity of Croatian HVO troops and Bosnian Army troops in the same territory caused renegade skirmishes to grow into larger military battles. The war between Bosnian and Croat forces was characterized by surges through Croat villages by the Bosnian Army, burning and looting as it went. For its part, Croatian HVO troops rounded up Muslim men in conquered villages. Incidents of ethnic cleansing, massacres and continued fighting between the Muslims and Croats were widespread.

  At the same time, the Bosnian Serb Army continued to advance against the Muslim forces. In response to the ruthless attack on the Bosnian city of Srebrenica and its subsequent surrender to the Serb forces in April 1993, and to heavy fighting elsewhere, in June 1993, the United Nations Security Council parsed Resolution 836 expanding the mandate for the UNPROFOR troops to include protection of six Bosnian "safe areas." The areas included Sarajevo, Bihac, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Gorazde and Zepa and allowed "all necessary measures" including air power to support UNPROFOR in its protection of the safe areas. The designation of the safe areas required UNPROFOR to progress from peacekeeping to peace-enforcement in these areas and marked the first time in the conflict that the United Nations relinquished its strict neutrality and committed to the protection of one side over the other. In reality, however, the declared "safe areas" were far from safe. As 1993 continued, prospects for peace in the region remained slim. United States diplomats attempted to negotiate a cease-fire and union between the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims in August 1993, but provocations and broken promises on both sides caused the fighting to continue into the fall and winter. In October, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution extending the mandate for the UNPROFOR forces until March 31, 1994. In November, Bosnian Croat shelling destroyed the famous Old Bridge in Mostar, an international landmark built by the Ottoman Turks in 1566 and a symbol of past unity in a town where the ethnically-diverse residents had lived in mutual tolerance. Under pressure from the United States and other nations that advocated the lifting of the arms embargo, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution on December 20, 1993, urging the Security Council to lift the embargo on the Bosnian government. However, the Security Council did not have the votes to enact such a measure.

  In 1995, during the Bosnian war, Operation Deny Flight transitioned to Operation Deliberate Force, after artillery shells killed 38 civilians and injured 85 others, by Serb forces. The air campaign resulted in few civilian casualties, and ended the civil conflict. Indeed, experts have documented the Operation's efforts to avoid civilian casualties and applaud its efforts and results, "constraints on force application entailed avoiding collateral effects and unintended consequences that would be counterproductive to the political peace process. This effort to avoid collateral and unintended damage extended not only to the surrounding physical targets but also to concerns about fratricide, refugees, and noncombatant civilian casualties. The need for precision offensive air operations (OAS) platforms and weapons to limit collateral damage while accomplishing mission objectives became an overriding concern during the Balkans air campaign. Thus, precision-guided munitions (PGM) became the overwhelming weapons of choice during air strike operations. Indeed, Deliberate Force became the first air campaign in history to employ more precision-guided bombs and missiles than unguided ones."<sup>[[11]](https://www.airforcemag.com/article/1097deliberate/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[12]](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0074_OWEN_DELIBERATE_FORCE.pdf)</sup> 

#### Negotiating the Federation Agreement:

- In February of 1994, Bosnian Serbs attacked a crowded market square in Sarajevo, killing sixty-eight people, wounding more than 200 and sparking worldwide outrage. The Clinton Administration responded to the incident by calling for NATO air strikes against Serb gun  emplacements and encouraging the Muslims and Croats to present a unified defense against the Serbs. The Serb forces agreed to comply with the NATO demands, thereby avoiding the threatened air strikes. The front lines did not remain quiet for long. Later in February 1994, the first combat action in the 45-year-old history of NATO was initiated when United States fighter pilots downed four Bosnian Serb planes illegally flying in a no-fly zone.


  Throughout the Muslim-Croat conflict, mediators from the United States sought to exert pressure on both sides to enter into peace negotiations. In February, the United Nations issued an ultimatum to Croatia to pull its army out of Bosnia or face sanctions and world isolation. The threat worked.  Croatia agreed to withdraw its army and commence serious negotiations for a Federation. By the end of February, the Bosnians and Croats were en route to Washington and, over the next four days, negotiated a draft agreement. Despite the year long violence between the Muslims and Bosnian Croats, the two parties signed an accord establishing a fragile alliance. President Clinton hailed the pact as "one of the first clear signals that parties to this conflict are willing to end the violence and begin a process of reconstruction." The impact of the Federation Agreement was instrumental to the survival of the Bosnian Muslims until the signing of the Dayton Accords the following year. The most important and immediate consequence of the Agreement was to enable the Bosnian Army to focus its energy on  the war with Serb forces, and to create a Muslim-Croatian unified defense to put additional pressure on the Serbs to negotiate a peace settlement. The Bosnian Army's supply of weapons and munitions increased as a result of access to Croatian weapons caches and the arms pipeline was reopened through Croatian territory. The alliance also enhanced the delivery of needed humanitarian aid to Muslim enclaves.

  Despite the momentum provided by successful negotiations to establish the Muslim-Croat Federation, peace with the Bosnian Serbs was not forthcoming. The Serb forces continued to hold seventy percent of the territory in Bosnia. In April 1994, gunfire and explosions erupted again in Sarajevo. At the same time, the Serbs launched attacks against three United Nations "safe havens. Srebrenica and Zepa fell quickly. Gorazde, a city of 65,000 strategically located between two large Serb-held towns in the Drina Valley, was subjected to a devastating siege. The Bosnian Serbs were attempting to consolidate their territory in the event that a quickly-moving peace process would freeze existing boundaries. United Nations officials, however, interpreted the vigorous attacks on the cities in northern Bosnia as retaliation against the Federation agreement. 

  The siege of Gorazde was particularly harsh. United States Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia Charles Redman characterized the attack as "very, very brutal ... we simply had a bunch of helpless civilians being pounded at point blank range by Serbian tanks." At the height of the assault, Serb gunners were hitting the city an average of once every twenty seconds for an entire day. Bosnian President Izetbegovic responded with another international call for weapons to be used in self-defense. The events in Gorazde made absolutely clear the inability of the UNPROFOR forces to protect the "safe areas" under the existing rules of engagement. The situation was becoming increasingly dangerous to citizens of Gorazde, the international relief agency personnel and the United Nations personnel in the city.

  UNPROFOR Commander General Rose demanded Serbian General Mladic put a stop to the attacks on Gorazde or face NATO action, but the attacks continued. In what President Clinton described as "a clear call to the Serbs to pull back from Gorazde and resume the negotiations," NATO jets began to carry out air strikes against the Serb forces with increasing frequency and intensity to protect the United Nations personnel and civilians. Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic retaliated by detaining United Nations troops and officials, banning American  journalists from Serb territories and declaring United Nations Commander Rose persona non grata. The retaliation by the Serb forces hardened allied opposition to a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. Bosnian Serbs also blocked United Nations relief convoys from bringing needed food and medicine to Gorazde. Near the end of April, Bosnian Serb troops began to comply with NATO deadlines to withdraw their heavy weapons and air strikes diminished. While the Bosnian Serbs unleashed fierce attacks on the "safe areas" and other Bosnian enclaves, and the number of civilian casualties skyrocketed, the United States Congress hotly debated the issues of the arms embargo. During the spring of 1994, both Houses voted to mandate the lifting of the embargo. The disproportionate impact of the arms embargo had become increasingly clear to the Administration, Congress, and the American public. Moreover, the new Federation Agreement between the Croats and Muslims offered the first real opportunity to forge a peace in the region. This is the moment in the history of the Balkan conflict when the United States Ambassador responded to the President of Croatia that he had "no instructions" with respect to either the United States would object if Croatia allowed arms shipments from other countries to pass through its territory into Bosnia.

##### The Fall 1994 Initiative

- During the summer of 1994, the United States undertook an analysis of a possible covert action to arm the Bosnian Muslims. This option was rejected, however, because the United States determined it impossible to sustain such an activity for any extended period of time. In the fall of 1994, the United States also considered whether third countries should be encouraged to transship arms through Croatia to Bosnia. The "third country option" was initiated, in part, to respond to a proposal made by the Bosnian government to suspend its demands for lifting the embargo in return for an increase in arms shipments. This proposal also was rejected due to the risk that the allies would discover the arrangement and accuse the United States of a breach of the arms embargo.

  During the fall of 1994, individuals within the CIA nevertheless became suspicious that U.S. officials, including Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the new Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, were involved in a covert program to provide arms to the Bosnian Muslims for which a Presidential finding as required by law had not been made. The [redacted] reported on a series of incidents during the summer and fall of 1994 that he thought suggested senior U.S. officials were involved in such activity. Individuals within the CIA's Operations and Intelligence Directorates independently developed and reported to CIA leadership their suspicions about the activities of U.S. officials with regard to arms deliveries to the Bosnian Muslims. These suspicions were based in part on reporting by the [redacted] of intelligence and in part on comments and rumors conveyed to him by the Deputy Chief of Mission at Embassy Zagreb (the "DCM"). In September and October 1994, various intelligence sources incorrectly reported that senior officials of the United States government were engaged in active negotiations with third countries to provide arms to the Bosnians. In reality, United States government officials were simply exploring options of whether and how the Bosnians might be armed. The exploration of options was, in part, a result of the pressure the Congress was putting on the Administration to lift the embargo.

##### Communications and Miscommunications at the CIA

- Communications between the senior officials of the Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency over the United States Government policy and conduct in the Balkans lapsed in April/May 1994 and in September/October 1994. On May 5, at the weekly meeting of Secretary of Stale Christopher and DCI Woolsey (also attended on this occasion by Deputy Secretary Talbott), the DCI described a request Ambassador Galbraith had made of an ICR in Croatia. The DCI said Ambassador Galbraith had asked an ICR to [redacted] that the United States would, in effect, look the other way with regard to the transshipment of arms through Croatian-held territory to Bosnia. DCI Woolsey's description of the Ambassador's request set off a chain of miscommunication and misunderstanding. Deputy Secretary Talbott knew that Ambassador Galbraith had been instructed to tell the Croatians that he had "no instructions." When he heard the words "look the other way." he was therefore surprised. In fact, Ambassador Galbraith  did  not tell the Croatians that the United States Government would look the other way. The DCIs characterization of the message Ambassador Galbraith had transmitted incorrectly left Deputy Secretary Talbott with the impression that the Ambassador had expressed United States support for the transshipment of arms to the Croatian government. The use of the words "look the other way" by the DCI led Deputy Secretary Talbott to express concern because it was not consistent with the direction given to Ambassador Galbraith. The "no instructions" language was formulated to avoid putting the United States government in the position of either supporting or opposing the transshipment of arms. The "no instructions" response is very difference from the language that the DCI attributed to the Ambassador, ie, saying that the United States would, in effect, look the other way. In fact. Ambassador Galbraith had made his request of an ICR in Croatia so that an earlier and incorrect description of United States policy conveyed to a Croatian official could be corrected.

  For its part, [redacted] neglected to inform an ICR in Croatia that Ambassador Galbraith had been instructed to tell the Croatian government that he had "no instructions" regarding the transshipment of arms across Croatian-held territory to Bosnia. The failure of [redacted]  to inform the ICR of the "no instructions" response caused the ICR to continue to assume through mid-November 1994 that United States policy was to enforce the embargo against third country transshipments of aims through Croatian-held territory to Bosnia and that Ambassador Galbraith and other United States Government officials were taking actions contrary to that policy.

##### The May 1994 Convoy Incident

- The overriding objective on the ground in Bosnia in 1994 and throughout most of the war was to provide food, clothing and medical supplies to the Bosnians. The primary means of delivering these supplies was relief convoys. The convoys numbered in the thousands and were often stopped by Bosnian Croats to harass the Muslims. Often, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees which administered the United Nations convoy relief operation would contact United States Government officials for assistance in gaining the release of detained convoys. On many occasions. United States officials would intercede to expedite the progress of these convoys. Intelligence and other sources raised suspicions about whether some relief convoys may have carried weapons in addition to humanitarian supplies. The Minority believes that some convoys did carry weapons, but found no evidence to suggest that any United States Government official knowingly assisted in the relief of such a convoy. The Minority concludes that Special Envoy Redman did not intervene knowingly to have an arms convoy released. Some circumstantial evidence suggests that Special Envoy Redman may have made a call from Vienna regarding a convoy during the first week of May 1994. The source of that evidence, however, testified that Special Envoy Redman had no knowledge or awareness of any arms on the convoy. Further, no evidence of any kind exists to suggest that Ambassador Galbraith or any other United States personnel facilitated the release of this convoy or any prior or subsequent arms convoys.

  The Minority concludes that had it not been for this rampant speculative reporting, the May 1994 convoy would have been no more significant than the thousands of other convoys that traversed the region during the war. The allegations of misconduct and possible covert action were wholly unsupported by any evidence and should not have been accorded the level of significance that was afforded them. The Minority also believes that the CIA must do a better job of distinguishing between speculation and gossip in intelligence reporting. The speculation by the DCM about Special Envoy Redman was rumor and gossip, not intelligence.


##### Alleged Meetings between Ambassador Galbraith and the Muslim Cleric Omerbasic

- The transshipment of arms from Iran and other Islamic countries to Bosnia through Croatia undoubtedly involved the work of middlemen, arms dealers and other shadowy figures. The shadowy figure who emerged in the Select Subcommittee investigation was Imam Omerbasic, the religious leader of the Muslims in Zagreb. The Minority shares the belief that Imam Omerbasic played a role in arranging arms shipments to the Bosnian Muslims. However, the Minority strongly objects to any effort to connect the Imam's role to any United States Government official. For example, Imam Omerbasic met with Senator Bob Dole who also was sympathetic to the plight of the Bosnian Muslims. Testimony and documents reviewed by the Select Subcommittee staff offer no evidence to suggest that a secret contact or conversation between the Ambassador and the cleric ever occurred and that supplying Bosnia with arms was ever discussed.

  In response to a question posed to the cleric asking if the Ambassador ever was involved in working to arm the Bosnian Muslims, the cleric replied that "unfortunately that was not the case." The Imam explained that if the Muslims had received weapons from the United States, they would have not have suffered as many casualties. The cleric went on to state that he had no knowledge of any United States officials involved in arming Bosnia. That Imam Omerbasic expressed disappointment that the United States had not supplied arms to the Bosnian Muslims, further casts doubt on the possibility that Ambassador Galbraith or any other United States  official ever had made an offer of arms.

  The record is clear. The Ambassador first met Mr. Omerbasic in July 1993 on a courtesy call. Anns were not discussed. The second possible contact between the Ambassador and the cleric with respect to which none of the participants - including the cleric - has a clear memory of who attended, was a social event covered by the press in which no discussion of arms occurred. Two years later in May 19%, when the new Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Finn made a courtesy call on the Imam, the cleric noted that he was the first official from the Embassy the cleric had met with in two years. In fact, the speculative, incomplete and inaccurate nature of the reporting created suspicions within the CIA that a covert operation, spearheaded by Ambassador Galbraith, was underway. This was wildly disproportionate to the facts.

##### Mystery Flights into Tuzla

- Among the most publicized allegations of United States involvement in arming the Bosnian Muslims involved the February 1995 reports of United States cargo aircraft landing at Tuzla airport. These reports were investigated at the time they occurred by NATO, the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. No evidence confirming the reports was discovered.

  The reports of phantom C-130 cargo planes escorted by fighter jets first surfaced in the public media in February 1995. According to press accounts," United Nations peacekeepers reported hearing and seeing cargo planes escorted by fighter aircraft flying over the Tuzla airport on the nights of February 10 and 12, 1995. On the evening of February 10, 1995. a patrol went to investigate the alleged flight but retreated after being fired upon by Bosnian Muslim forces. Although no cargo or other aircraft actually were observed on the ground at any of the four airstrips which comprise the Tuzla airport region, the press reported speculation that the United States was involved. Press speculation about a United States role in the flights persisted because it was believed that the C-130s may have been conducting maneuvers such as air drops of high technology weapons that could have only been performed by only a few countries such as the United States, France, and Britain. On both occasions, NATO, the entity responsible for maintaining the no-fly zone over Bosnia, found nothing to verify that the flights had taken place. The speculation continued, however, because the United States had primary responsibility for the monitoring of the no-fly zone via radar and other aircraft and thus presumably could have allowed the flights to proceed "undetected." Some alleged that the United States also would have been in the position to know when radar coverage of the Tuzla area would be diminished sufficiently to permit clandestine flights. On February 24, 1995, the Russian delegation to the United Nations Security Council asked for a formal report from NATO and the United Nations on the mystery flights. NATO subsequently launched a military investigation into the matter. Military investigators traveled to Tuzla and interviewed eye witnesses in order to reconstruct events. The military investigation concluded that the flights observed by the Norwegian members of UNPROFOR on February 10 and 12, 1995, were attributed to "scheduled . . . NATO flights." NATO released the results of its investigation on March 1, 1995. Despite the NATO investigation, questions continued to linger within European circles about the Tuzla flights and possible United States involvement. Press reports continued sporadically throughout 1995, quoting unidentified U.N. officials alleging that the flights "had been a weapons delivery" and that "the United States had approved of the. . . operations."

  According to the report prepared by the NATO investigative team, beginning at approximately 5:45 p.m. on February 10. UNPROFOR personnel located in Sector Northeast reported the sighting of a transport type aircraft with two fighter escorts." According to the Air Operations Coordination Center ("AOCC") in Sarajevo, these planes were seen landing at the Tuzla West airstrip. Approximately one hour later, U.N. monitors also began receiving reports of fixed wing activity around Tuzla. In all, four reports of fixed wing activity were lodged on February 10, 1995. The second report occurred in the early evening of Sunday, February 10, 1995. UNPROFOR personnel began reporting "jet noise" over Tuzla. Reports of fixed wing aircraft filtered into NATO and United Nations monitoring centers for nearly an hour. While attempting to ascertain if a plane had landed at that Tuzla West airstrip, a team of Nordic UNPROFOR troops was surrounded by Bosnian forces and prohibited from examining the airstrip.

  The Select Subcommittee reviewed documentation provided by the Department of Defense, including the final report issued by the NATO investigative team, and interviewed numerous individuals will, knowledge of the rumours and investigations of them. The Minority concludes that no credible evidence exists to substantiate the claim that the United States delivered arms to the Bosnian Muslims via cargo flights on February 10 or 12, 1995. 

##### The missile incident

- The incident that appears to have attracted the most concern involves a shipment of missiles from Iran that was stopped in Croatia. The Croatian authorities asked the United States Government to inspect the missiles for chemical warheads. The Defense Attache at Embassy Zagreb, accompanied by two different intelligence officers, inspected the missiles on two separate occasions. The officials concluded that the missiles did not contain chemical warheads. No credible evidence to indicate any other United States involvement in the missile shipment was determined. The Majority alleges that Ambassador Galbraith was involved in pressuring the Croats to release the missiles to the Bosnians. The sources for the allegation are two Croat officials whose credibility and veracity have been challenged in a general way by a number of other Americans, and whose account of this event is inconsistent the the account of all other United States officials involved with the missile inspection. In a May 21, 1996 article. The Los Angeles Times reported that in September 1995 the United States was involved in the inspection of a shipment of missiles destined for Bosnia from Iran. The article alleged that United States officials had gone beyond passive acknowledgment of the arms pipeline to a direct role in facilitating the arms flow. The article claimed that the CIA and the military, after overcoming their alarm at the weapon's potential permitted them to be released to the Bosnians under the direction of Ambassador Galbraith. The Select Subcommittee undertook a detailed investigation of these allegations. Staff reviewed official reports and documents generated about the shipment, including the cable traffic of both the Defense Attache and the [redacted] in Zagreb; interviewed numerous witnesses with first hand knowledge of the events; and reviewed media accounts and Congressional hearing testimony.

  The Minority concludes, in direct contradiction to the findings of the Majority, that the inspection of the missiles by United States military and intelligence personnel was conducted for the sole purpose of determining whether the missiles were armed with chemical warheads. The Minority also concludes that the inspection was consistent with the terms and conditions of the Nunn-Mitchell amendment. The Minority concludes further that the inspection was appropriate for this limited purpose in order to protect United States civilian and military personnel from the risks of introducing chemical weapons into the region. The Minority found no credible or substantive evidence that Ambassador Galbraith. the [redacted] or any other United States government official facilitated or encouraged the release of these missiles. The Intelligence Oversight Board ("lOB") which had concluded in May 1995 that no United States covert activity to arm the Bosnian Muslims had occurred in 1994, initiated an informal review of the "missile allegation" as a supplement to its report. Based on interviews with key United States individuals, the lOB determined that no evidence existed to suggest that Ambassador Galbraith, [redacted]  or any other United States official pressured the Croatians to release the missiles.

#### Bosnian Train and Equip program, July 09, 1996
- Dayton Agreement Provisions to Protect IFOR:

  "Consistent with the United States policy of isolating Iran, and in response to specific concerns about the safety of United States troops, the United States has been particularly diligent in making sure the Dayton signatories comply with the so-called "foreign forces" provision in the peace agreement." This provision requires the removal of foreign forces from Bosnia, a catch-all phrase meant to include the volunteer Mujahideen forces, foreign Islamic fundamentalist forces, the Iranian military, and other extreme elements who had come to the region during the conflict to volunteer with the warring factions. As leverage to ensure compliance with this provision, the United States has linked the removal of foreign forces, in particular Iranian volunteer forces, with the receipt of United States aid. This strategy has been successful, and although the Bosnian Government was slow to pressure the foreign fighters to leave their territory after the Dayton Agreement was signed, it has made significant strides in the ensuing months. On June 7, 1996, President Clinton provided certification that the number of foreign forces remaining in Bosnia was low enough to trigger the United States "equip and train program" to proceed."

#### Conclusion on aid allegations

  Several investigations were conducted to examine the charges. In total, millions of classified records were examined, many hundreds of individuals interviewed and cross-examined. The following are the core conclusions of these independent & authoritative studies. Above are, are specific areas of concern, to clarify the confusing record left in the wake of sensationalist headlines and conspiracy theories:

- "From the outset of the Clinton Administration, it was United Slates policy neither to oppose nor support third party arms transfers to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This policy was embodied In the "no instructions" response to the Croatian Government's question on the United States view on the transshipment of arms. It served several important United States interests, and helped establish conditions on the ground that pointed the way to peace. The United States took no action to aid arms transfers to the former Yugoslavia. At no time did any United States government official take any action to supply arms to any country or entity covered by the U.N. arms embargo. At no time did any United States government official undertake any covert action to supply arms to any country or entity covered by the embargo, or to encourage, aid or assist in the shipment or transfer of arms to any country in the former Yugoslavia. No United States Government official coordinated, cooperated, conspired with or suggested to the Bosnian Muslims, the Government of Croatia, or the Bosnian Croats that the United States be asked to state its view of the transshipment of arms. United States Government officials directed Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith to respond that he had "no instructions" when asked for the reaction of the United States government to the transshipment of arms through Croatia to Bosnia by the government of Croatia. Ambassador Galbraith carried out his directions correctly and promptly. There was no "greenlight" for Iran.<sup>[[13]](https://archive.org/details/bosnia-arms)</sup></sup> 

- "The Committee found no evidence that the United States ever provided such support or any quid pro quo to Croatia, or encouraged any country to provide arms or military assistance in violation of the arms embargo, despite the fact that on September 27, 1994, Bosnia did publicly call for a United Nations resolution lifting the arms embargo that would incorporate a six-month delay."<sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/united-states-actions-regarding-iranian)</sup></sup>

- "Based on the facts developed during the Committee's inquiry into the matter of the shipment of Iranian arms into Bosnia, we believe that the following conclusions are inescapable: (1) the United States government undertook no covert action to ship weapons to Bosnia or Croatia; (2) No U.S. official directed, controlled or facilitated the shipment of Iranian arms to Bosnia or Croatia; (3) No U.S. official violated U.S. law relating to covert action, intelligence activities, or notifications to Congress; (4) No discrepancies justifying a criminal investigation exist in the testimony of the witnesses who appeared before the Committee; and (5) Nothing in the Committee's inquiry contradicts the findings of the 1995 and 1996 investigations of the President's Intelligence Oversight Board."<sup>[[15]](https://archive.org/details/investigation-into-iranian-arms-shipment)</sup></sup>

- Able Archer, in 1983, didn't come close to starting a nuclear war, as many revisionists allege. Simon Miles, in his earth-shattering examination, reviewed declassified records from various countries to prove the origins of this claim stem from Soviet disinformation.<sup>[[1]](https://direct.mit.edu/jcws/article-abstract/22/3/86/95296/The-War-Scare-That-Wasn-t-Able-Archer-83-and-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/7415273/h-diplo-article-review-1024-war-scare-wasn%E2%80%99t)</sup></sup>

-  Arising in August 1980 as the first independent trade union in Eastern Europe, Solidarity rapidly grew into a national protest movement against Poland’s chronically inept Communist regime. It enjoyed legal status for a year and half. Then, on the night of 12/13 December 1981, a junta calling itself the Military Council of National Salvation, headed by strongman Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, seized power and declared martial law. Military and security forces put the entire country on lockdown and rounded up thousands of Solidarity members in a carefully planned nationwide dragnet. A few leaders remained free and sent a message to the West asking for help. On 4 November 1982, Ronald Reagan signed a Presidential Finding that authorized the CIA to covertly provide money and non-lethal aid to the Polish underground movement known as Solidarity. The CIA assigned the cryptonym QRHELPFUL to its operation. The stated goal was to “to keep the spirit of Solidarity alive” by supporting “moderate elements” in Solidarity. This accorded with the intentions and goals of the mainstream underground activists. Their “limited revolution” sought to wrest concessions and rights from the Communist regime without seeking to overthrow it or withdraw from the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact.<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08850607.2019.1565587)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08850607.2012.652523)</sup> </sup>  <sup>[[3]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08850607.2016.1121054)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/static/US-Intelligence-and-the-Polish-Crisis-1980-1981-1.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1948-1956, Italy, the CIA aided centrists; socially/economically left-wing governments; labor unions; student groups and other socialist groups to provide political stability in preventing Soviet-backed right-wing authortarian groups to take hold—leading to a decade of democratic socialism. In total, only $3 million was provided to these various groups. A study finding, "The defeat of the Right meant that Communism's threat would be met through democratic politics, not a reversion to Fascism. The strength of the Socialists, even without aid from the outside, meant that left-wing sentiment looked toward a democratic form of socialism."<sup>[[1]](https://ia801601.us.archive.org/14/items/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-1956/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-56.pdf)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the CIA and NATO, supported right-wing terror groups in Italy (and elsewhere in Europe) from the 50s to the 90s, under "Operation Gladio"—to suppress left-wing governments and movements. This claim has been long-discredited by the consensus of Cold war historians. The US State Department confirmed some "evidence" of false flags were nothing more than KGB forgeries. The CIA did have a limited, brief effort to have organised resistance groups in Europe, in case the Soviet empire engaged in imperialistic shenanigans. However, nothing as described by the historical revisionists. In total, only a few dozen individuals were ever trained; they never did anything—and the programs quickly dropped.<sup>[[1]](https://direct.mit.edu/jcws/article-abstract/16/4/35/13485/Stay-Behind-A-Clandestine-Cold-War-Phenomenon?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676485)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.scribd.com/document/114855262/Misinformation-About-Gladio-Stay-Behind-Networks-Resurfaces)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02684520500340357)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390500448524)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850600500332656)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16161262.2005.10555113)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.cia.gov/static/9f3bcb469cee52fd1017f1c7c84aeadc/intel-officers-bookshelf-11.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676493)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676501)</sup></sup>

  Historian Kevin Ruffner finds, "Not only did OPC organize emigre groups for both propaganda tools and operational purposes, Frank Wisner also launched a program to train Eastern Europeans for clandestine operations against the Soviet Union. Wisner approved ZRELOPE in late July 1950 because "the acceleration of extensive OPC operations in the Soviet Union and its satellites, and further pursuance of resistance activities elsewhere abroad require the utilization of strong numbers of specially-trained personnel native to the area concerned." OPC estimated that it needed to train some 2,000 personnel over the next year in such fields as political warfare operations, resistance operations, escape and evasion  operations, communications, and "the will to fight and will to lead." OPC's use of emigres coincided with mounting interest among the US government agencies to organize displaced persons into paramilitary formations. Given the poor security environment in Germany (the Russian Intelligence Services had targeted virtually every emigre group there), OPC proposed to train these personnel in the United States. Prior to launching ZRELOPE, OPC formed a special task group to contact both Federal agencies and private individuals about the feasibility of this project. By November 1950, this group presented its report and recommended that OPC train a "diverse group" of foreigners in the United States for covert operations and establish a civilian cover committee "in order to sponsor trainees and disburse funds." The group also recommended that the DCI approve ZRELOPE and obtain similar approbation from the National Security Council (neither level of approval was mandatory for OPC projects at the time). In December 1950, OPC decided to initiate a pilot program with 100 trainees.

  While OPC sought a suitable facility for ZRELOPE (it selected Grand Bahama Island in Florida after examining 70 sites), a number of unforeseen problems arose. ZRELOPE, for example, suffered from splintered command and control within OPC. Whereas [redacted headed up Task Group BOULDER (which formulated overall planning and delivery of the candidates to the United States), OPC's Eastern Europe Division (EE) ran the selection, recruitment, and clearing of ZRELOPE trainees. The Training Division (TRD), a joint OSO/OPC element, trained the candidates and provided for cover and security of the project and its personnel. Project ZRELOPE had a grueling schedule. [redacted] chief of EE told [redacted] in March 1951 that the Department of Defense required 1,000 graduates by June 1952. To facilitate the selection of candidates, Frank Wisner informed the ADSO that same month that OPC needed to interview some four to five thousand candidates in Europe in order to fill the required 2,000 training slots. Wisner added, "as each candidate will require a field security investigation prior to final screening, a heavy burden will fall upon your field organizations, especially in Germany and Austria." The project's haste naturally raised questions about the thoroughness of the background investigations of the selected recruits. [redacted] of EE traveled to Germany in May 1951 to review the progress of ZRELOPE and its subprojects, JBPLEDGE (recruitment of trainees) and KMKIMONO (recruitment of instructors). 28 OPC planned to draw from some 60 "guard companies," with approximately 200 men each, performing various housekeeping tasks at US Army garrisons throughout Germany. By May of 1951, [redacted] stimated that some 60 percent of the guard company members had already been canvassed and that OPC had selected nearly 800 candidates. OPC had five case officers to do the screening, although a native Russian speaker handled the initial interviews and conducted the records checks. Candidates then traveled to Munich for psychological assessments. The actual recruitment occurred after the psychological assessment. Despite morale problems (the candidates did not want to leave their families in Germany), [redacted]  presented an optimistic appraisal. "I believe," he noted, "they will turn up in time a sufficient number of likely candidates to produce 100 willing candidates that can be started moving to the states between September 1st and September 15th [1951]. In saying that, I believe that we will be able to procure the minimum number of personnel which they require, that the field security will be able to speed up the results of their security checks and that home security will do the same. The security issue posed a serious problem, as [redacted] of TRD discovered in early 1951. Lt. Col. William R. Peers, an OSS veteran and Army officer serving as TRD's chief, found OPC's selection of ZRELOPE candidates to be less than adequate. Peers told Wisner that "although the foreign division concerned will be responsible for the selection of the students, including the checking of their security and political affiliations, it is readily apparent that if these matters are not given full consideration and properly handled initially, the Training Division later may be faced with the situation of having numerous security problems on its hands which by that time it will be powerless to correct."

  After great discussion and even greater expense, ZRELOPE proved to be a short-lived program. It failed because OPC could not recruit and vet candidates to meet its goal of 2,000 trained resistance fighters. The paramilitary aspect of ZRELOPE (known as ZRCORSET) was the first subproject to be discontinued because of a lack of recruits. In turn, CIA soon abandoned efforts to procure a "suitable" training area in the United States for the project. The political action element of ZRELOPE, or ZRDAMSEL, conducted a class in 1952 for a dozen-odd students at a hotel near Winchester, Virginia, utilizing the cover of the Franklin Development Foundation of Philadelphia. Despite plans to bring a new class to the training site, CIA canceled the entire program in November 1952. TRD estimated that the political action portion of ZRELOPE alone cost $30,000 per student—an incredible expense for little gain.

  The Hot War Cadre Programs:

  Despite the disappointing results of ZRELOPE, CIA continued to believe it could fashion the emigres into a potent fighting force in the event of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. Several CIA projects concentrated on the recruitment of foreigners for paramilitary or insertion training in the United States. Even as OPC dropped ZRELOPE, it expanded an earlier project, WSBAKERY. In January 1952, OPC (with OSO's consent) organized Project AEACRE, which called for the establishment of a Domestic Operations Base (DOB) near Washington, DC, that would allow the Agency to interrogate, assess, and prepare agents for dispatch into the Soviet Union. Like ZRELOPE, AEACRE encountered problems in recruiting knowledgeable instructors as well as in finding suitable agent candidates. This project, however, had no difficulties in the "black" entry and exit processing of agents thanks to the cooperation of the US Air Force and the INS. This aspect of CIA's covert training seems to have rarely posed a problem. The majority of personnel trained at DOB participated in REDSOX missions. These operations declined after the mid-1950s as CIA realized their futility, but the Soviet suppression of Hungary in 1956, however, rejuvenated DOB because the Joint Chiefs of Staff assigned new unconventional warfare tasks to the CIA. AEACRE spawned a new project in 1956 as the CIA upgraded its "hot war" plans in anticipation of the need for a reserve body of trained agents. In late 1956, Project AEREADY came into existence to build up a force of personnel, native to various target areas of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East, who possessed area knowledge, language skills, and paramilitary training. Following basic training under CIA auspices, these agents returned home to their civilian jobs and held themselves ready for emergency callup and annual refresher training. Unlike either ZRELOPE or AEACRE, AEREADY did not require overseas recruitment or transportation to the United States. Rather, the new project identified these specialized individuals from INS rosters of immigrants and displaced persons already in America. AEREADY, however, also suffered from a lack of suitable personnel. After extensive nationwide searches, CIA ended up assessing 27 candidates for each successful agent that completed training. Members of the US armed forces with foreign language skills provided the initial cadre of AEREADY trainees.

  The Army provided cover for Project AEREADY at Fort Meade, Maryland, where it established Material Testing Unit No. 1. Similar units were also organized for specialized training at Army posts in North Carolina, Virginia, and New York. By 1961, AEREADY (known as AEDEPOT after 1958) had produced a pool of 63 reserve agents from 13 ethnic groups. Ukrainians formed the largest single body of agents with 17 personnel, followed by Russians, Latvians, and Lithuanians. 45 CIA integrated teams of AEDEPOT personnel into various military training exercises, both in the United States and in Europe. The need to maintain a reserve cadre of European agents, however, diminished in the 1960s as the threat of Soviet invasion of Europe receded. In its place, communist insurgencies in Latin America and Southeast Asia posed new challenges that prompted CIA to reconsider its reserve hot war program. In 1966, the Agency deactivated WUDEPOT (as AEACRE and AEDEPOT had been redesignated two years earlier). While a handful of the reserve agents served in Latin America and Vietnam, the cancellation of WUDEPOT effectively ended the CIA's paramilitary training of Eastern Europe emigres."<sup>[[11]](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf#page=284)</sup></sup>

- The list claims the CIA installed Georgios Papadopoulos in a Greece military coup in 1967. The list cited a wiki entry that contradicts the allegation, and confirms it was just that: An allegation. The wiki entry states, "during William Colby's confirmation hearing to be Director of Central Intelligence, Colby was asked by Stuart Symington, chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, if there was any justification for the assertions. Colby replied that he had the allegations researched and found that the CIA had not engineered the coup, Papadopoulos was not an agent of the CIA, and that Papadopoulos was never paid by the CIA."<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074749253&view=2up&seq=7)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the CIA was involved in the Hungarian revolution against the brutal, authortarian Communist Stalinist regime; that the US signaled it would covertly, or overtly, help the democratic movement against the regime and USSR forces and that it had turned a blind-eye to the democratic revolution. However, a comprensive and authoritative declassified study reveals this isn't true. While the US was sympathtic to the Hungarian people, and pressing diplomacy at the UN, it was trying to avoid another world war: By disrupting the Soviet Union's atrocities agaisnt the movement, whilst also dealing with global matters that could have also sparked global conflict, such as the Suez crisis.<sup>[[1]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/MDR_Releases/FY12/12-M-1691.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/3473778/Document-01-Almost-Successful-Recipe-The-United.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Adolf Heusinger was not a nazi nor war criminal, despite pundit accusations. Promoted to colonel on 1 August 1940 and became chief of the Operationsabteilung in October 1940, which made him number three in the army's planning hierarchy, after the Chief of the General Staff, General Franz Halder, and the Deputy Chief of the General Staff/Chief Quartermaster, General Friedrich Paulus. After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the OKH became responsible primarily for planning operations in that theatre, and the Armed Forces High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW) was responsible for other theatres. Halder was replaced as Chief of the General Staff in September 1942 by General Kurt Zeitzler. Heusinger remained chief of the Operationsabteilung and was promoted to Generalleutnant on 1 January 1943. In June 1944, Zeitzler suffered a nervous breakdown and abandoned his post, and on 10 June, Heusinger temporarily assumed his office as Chief of the General Staff of the Army. In this capacity, he attended the meeting at Hitler's Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944, and he was standing next to Hitler when the bomb exploded that had been planted by Claus von Stauffenberg.

  Heusinger was hospitalised for his injuries in the explosion but was later arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo to determine his role, if any, in the 20 July Plot. 
  
  Since he was not accused of being a nazi, or a war criminal, he provided key testimony in the WW2 Tribunals. Heusinger's personal beliefs and political views were that of pro-democracy, and naturally found himself in support of the free West. Because of his skills in military planning operations. With the establishment of the West Germany Armed Forces Bundeswehr in 1955, Heusinger returned to military service. He was appointed a Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) on 12 November 1955, in the Bundeswehr and chairman of the Military Leadership Council.
  
  Shortly thereafter, in June 1957, Heusinger was promoted to full general and named the first Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, and he served in that capacity until March 1961. In April 1961, he was appointed Chair of the NATO Military Committee for Germany until 1964. The US had no say on this.<sup>[[1]](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/who_is_who_134296.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123033424/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/HEUSINGER%2C%20ADOLF_0006.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1949, the CIA supported the resistance movement against the oppressive, authoritarian Hoxha dictatorship in Albania. This was done through psychological and intelligence operations—which was widely supported by the local population, despite knowing the risks should they be found out by their oppressors. As one world-leading historian writes, "It has commonly been misread either as an all-out paramilitary effort to overthrow Albania’s communist government, or as a probe to test the feasibility of ‘rollback’ against Enver Hoxha’s regime and, by extension, the wider Soviet bloc. Recently declassified documents in the US and British archives – still largely neglected by historians – reveal that BGFIEND/Valuable was neither primarily a paramilitary campaign to overthrow Albania’s communist regime, nor a limited probe to test the viability of rollback behind the iron curtain. Instead, for the majority of its life, the operation principally constituted a psychological warfare campaign to subvert and harass Albania’s communist government, not to overthrow it, while keeping open the possibility of toppling the regime in the future. Removing Hoxha also risked undermining western cohesion by sparking territorial disputes between key allies Italy, Greece and Turkey. The status quo was therefore preferable to a provocative rollback effort, leading Anglo-American policymakers to indefinitely suspend their aggressive ambitions just six months after authorizing Hoxha’s overthrow." Sadly, "many who lost their lives or liberty infiltrating Albania, or to the many Albanian citizens who were ruthlessly suppressed by Hoxha’s police state in this period."<sup>[[1]](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2020.1754711?journalCode=fint20)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/obopus-bg-fiend-cia-operation-albania)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20150401215624/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/OBOPUS%20BGFIEND%20%20%20VOL.%2020%20%20%28BGFIEND%20OPERATIONS%29_0012.pdf)</sup></sup>

- It was alleged that the CIA's predecessor, OSS—was involved in aiding Nazi war criminals to further US Scientific inquiry and Intelligence operations, under "operation paperclip." This is a distortion of truth. It has been confirmed that there was no operation to rescue nazisfrom prosecution. As Allan Ryan, former Director of the Office of Special Investigation (the office to which Nazis were prosecuted) said,"From time to time in the past few years, books or other accounts have appeared claiming to expose some newly-discovered conspiracy by CIA, or the military, or a cabal of lawless bureaucrats, to bring Nazi collaborators to the United States after the war." "These accounts," according to Ryan, "have offered dubious evidence and have been unable to survive any objective analysis. 

  In a landmark treatise of all CIA files (still classified, those declassified), and public accounting, Historian Kevin Ruffner examines the role of PL 110, Sec 8. which has been misconstrued as the legal authority for this alleged Nazi smuggling. The purpose and use of this law was to facilitate defectors, including Communist defectors. No Nazi war criminals were permitted to enter, nor did any. Out of the total number of immigrants permitted to the US, between 1949 and 1982, only 3 may have had a connection to nazism. Another 3 had served in the German army and 3 in the Vlasov army. Ruffner concludes, "What can be summarized as the legacy of the Agency's Cold War defector program? Initially, OSS wanted to reward its European agents for faithful service during the war. Within months, however, this changed as the Soviets drew a tighter grip over Eastern Europe and the Americans found it necessary to evacuate its covert personnel from danger. The United States did not have a set plan to permit the emigration of its agents from Europe or to deal with defectors or deserters from the Soviet bloc. As a result, SSU, CIG, and CIA gradually slipped into the role as the responsible agency to handle defectors and their resettlement. By 1949, the problem of how to deal with these people had become critical, especially in Germany. New laws, such as the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 and the CIA Act of 1949, provided some help, but the NSC intelligence directives gave real direction to the Agency. After 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency was fully committed to using defectors as a weapon in fighting the Cold War. While an imperfect weapon, CIA did not deliberately use its position to "smuggle" Nazis out of Europe or to bring them or their collaborators to the United States.<sup>[[1]](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf#page=410)</sup></sup>
  
  As for Barbie: The 1983 Ryan report, concluded, "at no time from the end of World War II to the present time has the Central Intelligence Agency had any relationship with Klaus Barbie." He also determined that the "CIA was not involved in the use, control, or financing" of the rat line from Austria to Italy and then to South America that allowed Barbie to escape in 1951. Further, "the united States government has had no relationship of any kind with Klaus Barbie since he departed from Europe in 1951." As for the timeline and the Army's CIC: CIC personnel had no reliable indication until at least May 1949, some two years after Barbie was first employed, that he was suspected of war crimes or crimes against humanity. Not until the summer of 1950 did the French provide the evidence to the US Government. Further, it was not offered to, and was not reasonably available to, CIC officials, who had no reason even to know that it existed." A handful of CIC personnel misled HICOG's attempts to carry out its lawful obligation to decide the extradition of Klaus Barbie."<sup>[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-hrsp/legacy/2011/02/04/08-02-83barbie-rpt.pdf#page=212)</sup></sup>
  
  As for Otto von Bolschwing: He mostly lied and misled the CIA about his Nazi past in 1954. Not until 1960 did CIA learn of Bolschwing's larger role in the SS.<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000477271_0.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup>

  The CIA, (more than any), aided in bringing such justice in aiding the DOJ's OSI. In his role as director of the OSI, Ryan wrote, "no Federal agency, including the CIA, ever objected to any prosecution or tried to call off any investigation."<sup>[[4]](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201018014445/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol40no5/pdf/v40i5a12p.pdf)</sup></sup>

  There was a project paperclip, under the War Department, through the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA), established in 1945 as a subcommittee of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). However, this also did not protect and rescue nazis. "Persons proposed to be brought to the U.S. hereunder shall be screened by the Commanding General, USFET, on the basis of available records. No person found by the Commanding General, USFET, to have been a member of the Nazi Party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazism or militarism shall be brought to the U.S. hereunder. However, neither position nor honors awarded a specialist under the Nazi Regime solely on account of his scientific or technical ability will in themselves be considered sufficient to disqualify a specialist for evacuation to the U.S. hereunder. Where there is doubt as to qualification of a specialist under the preceding sentence, the Commanding General, USFET, may transport the specialist to the U.S., where further interrogation and screening shall be conducted immediately in order to determine such qualification. All specialists and families brought to the United States will be under temporary, limited military custody until such time as visas are granted or repatriation is accomplished. The degree of surveillance over any specialist will depend upon the length of time he has been under observation and exploitation in the United States, and the trustworthiness he has demonstrated under interrogation, screening and subsequent observation."<sup>[[6]](https://www.archives.gov/iwg/declassified-records/rg-330-defense-secretary)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1946v05/d448)</sup></sup>

  In 2005, the Interagency Working Group, (IGW, a team of world-leading historians) published a 2005 book that examined declassified records under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. It concludes: "Some claims about vast conspiracies involving the American government and Nazi war criminals or the intelligence use of some big-name Nazis in the postwar period turned out to be completely unfounded. And legends and concoctions about certain high-level criminals such as Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo, whose fate remained obscure at the end of the war, flourished best in a climate of suspicion and secrecy. The opening of OSS, CIA, and FBI records on Müller will not sway those determined to believe in conspiracy theories, but they should convince those who are willing to base conclusions on the evidence." It further concludes, "Nor was there any conspiracy to protect Hitler's willing executioners." and, "The piles of new CIC, FBI, and CIA files reveal no overarching policy by which American intelligence agencies targeted known SS or Gestapo officers for hiring."<sup>[[8]](https://archive.org/details/usintelligencena0000unse)</sup></sup>

  The United States took the lead in the first grand experiment with postwar justice beginning with the International Trial of the Major War Criminals at Nuremberg in 1945 and 1946.' Following this landmark trial, the United States held twelve more trials in Nuremberg, which involved 144 high-level defendants from the German High Command, the medical profession, big business, the judiciary, government ministries, SS economic officials, and most notably, the Einsatzgruppen. More military trials were held of German camp personnel and others so that by 1949, the United States had tried more than 1,800 German suspects. The U.S. war criminal prison in Landsberg had roughly one thousand inmates and bore the official name War Criminal Prison Number 1 on the assumption that there would be a War Criminal Prison Number 2. The worst SS criminals were hanged as late as July 1951, despite the virtual sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Germany, despite mass West German protests at Landsberg prison, and despite the intercession of high-ranking West Germans who would be instrumental for the rearmament of West Germany and its military alignment with NATO.3 Only the Soviet Union tried more German personnel. But Soviet proceedings were often for violations of Soviet criminal codes and contained a strong air of show trials.* Other continental European states, including West European ones, generally tried Germans only for crimes committed against their own nationals.

  Thus the United States' judicial record was unique, innovative, and substantial. It was not the policy of a state sympathetic with nazism, indifferent to the Holocaust, or soft on war criminals."
  
- Between 1945-1947, the OSS, and later CIA—briefly, worked with Ukrainian emigre groups after WW2. In 1947, the Central Intelligence Group approved USSR's extradition request for Bandera (after initial resistance), as well as ceasing intelligence gathering contact with the OUN, because of "the increasingly totalitarian attitude taken by Bandera." Due to ethics concerns, "by the spring of 1947 Munich base had orders to stop its work with the various emigre groups, especially the Ukrainians." Thus, all ties to groups were cut. CIA conducted another study in 1948 on various Ukraine groups to support and found that ZPUHVR would be suitable because, "ZPUHVR leaders have demonstrated that they are not interested in personal gain or profit... and has as kept itself morally and politically uncommitted and uncompromised over a period of three years." It should also be noted that Lebed and Hrinioch broke with Bandera's OUN in 1948.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/STUDIES%20IN%20INTELLIGENCE%20NAZI%20-%20RELATED%20ARTICLES_0015.pdf)</sup></sup>

The US and allied forces did their best to maintain compliance with international law, and did, with regards to detention operations of captive Germans. However, due to unforeseen issues such as the overwhelming numbers of German troop surrender, far more than planned—the Allied forces struggled to maintain sanitation conditions and other needs.

At this same location, though hours apart, CPT John T. Compton ordered a few of his men to kill a 36 POWs. Both cases were independently investigated and corroborated. Major General Troy H. Middleton convened a general court-martial for both men. West was found guilty, sentenced to life in prison. Compton's men didn't face Court-martial, since they acted under the orders of Compton, per Field Manual (FM) 27-10, Rules of Land Warfare, "Individuals of the armed forces will not be punished for these offenses in case they are committed under orders or sanction of their government or commanders. The commanders ordering the commission of such acts, or under whose authority they are committed by their troops, may be punished by the belligerent into whose hands they may fall." However, this also provided a defense in Compton's case—as, he claimed he was acting under the orders of General Patton. General Patton was cleared of wrong-doing by a seperate IG investigation. His speech didn't order killing of POWs, however it was misinterpreted as such. Since Compton thought he was acting on orders in good faith.<sup>[[1]](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/03-2013.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Asia

- In 2004, the Toledo Blade ran a series detailing alleged war crimes committed by "Tiger Force" in Vietnam. On 3 Feb, 1971, a former member of the 101st Airborne Division reported that a number of personnel from the Tiger Force Recon Platoon committed war crimes in South Vietnam, 1967. The Blade's series generally just repeated  and editorialized the allegations. However, a 2004 review of the paper's allegations of inconsistencies with the ROI found, “are attributed to misrepresentation of the facts and testimonial evidence being taken out of context.” The original report found most war crime allegations made in '71 were without merit. However, some were unable to be proven/disproven—and a few were found to be credible. Many of the credible cases had no action taken because those implicated were KIA in 1967, or were unidentified.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/tiger-force)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged the US Government aided Khmer Rouge, an organisation supported by China and other Communist states. The US engaged in a highly successful bombing campaign against the terror org. It has been confirmed <sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120133711/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90M00005R001000080038-7.pdf)</sup></sup> that the US had no involvement in aiding the org, "Since the fall of 1986 we have received reports about a letter from a Congressional Staffer alleging USG support for the Khmer Rouge. The letter was written by Jonathan Winer, counsel to Senator Kerry, and contained what were purported to be figures on annual USG support for the Khmer rouge starting in 1980. Winer claimed in his letter that the information on USG support was received from the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The allegation and figures included in Winer's letter are completely without basis in fact. The USG abhors and condemns the Khmer rouge and has never provided  any direct assistance to them. We have, however, generously supported the relief  program for displaced Cambodians on the Thai border. We also assist the Cambodian noncommunist resistance forces led by Prince Sihanouk and Son Sann in their struggle against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. We have initiated stringent safeguards in both programs to ensure that the assistances does not end up with the Khmer Rouge. The Congressional Research Service has denied any knowledge of the information attributed to it." 
  
  In 1978, President Carter issued a statement condemning the actions of the Democratic Kampuchea government and, importantly, used the word ‘genocide’ in his statement. In response to increased Khmer Rouge incursions into Vietnamese territory, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in December 1978.
  
  Famine was rife. Food stocks were dwindling due to disruptions in the harvest cycle caused by the invasion of Vietnamese troops, 150,000 of whom would remain in Cambodia for most of the decade. Some 300,000 Cambodian refugees lived in UN-administered camps along the Thai border, but only 10% were given refugee status, meaning the vast majority would spend the decade in limbo. International development groups, responding to the misery of the camps, poured into the border area to begin administering aid. The United States contributed $15 million per year in humanitarian assistance through organizations such as UNICEF and the International Committee for the Red Cross. As early as 1981, this aid began to have an impact on conditions in the camps, with the malnutrition rate among children falling from 50% to 2.5% in less than a year.
  
  It has also been alleged that the US "supported" the Khmer Rouge's seat at the UN, however, it's more nuanced than that, and also wrong. Beginning in 1979, and continuing throughout the 1980s, the United States – along with China, ASEAN and others – voted to allow the anti-government coalition to hold Cambodia’s seat at the United Nations. The United States argued that the PRK government was illegitimate since it was imposed by a foreign invasion, and it was consistent with international law to seat the predecessor government. US Government's position was that a country should not be deprived of representation at the United Nations simply because other Governments dislike that country's politics or find it morally objectionable. However, it welcomed the opportunity if a Supreme National Council was formed in time to present credentials for the next session of the UN General Assembly. The US tried to pressure Khmer Rouge out of the coalition government. In February and March of 1985, U.S. Representative Stephen Solarz, a Democrat from New York with a keen interest in developments in Cambodia, attempted to change the nature of U.S. support for these groups. Solarz proposed a $5 million package of overt, non-lethal aid; direct U.S. support for the groups up to that point had been covert and non-lethal, at $12 million per year. On May 15, the Senate approved a version of Solarz’ proposal. The House of Representatives then voted to pass the legislation in July, and President Reagan signed the bill on August 8, 1985. For the first time, U.S. non-lethal aid to the non-communist resistance would be overt, reaching a total of $15 million over the next three years.
 
  U.S. policy throughout the decade was to end Vietnamese military involvement in Cambodia and replace the Vietnamese-backed People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government with one that represented the will of the people. To that end, the United States, under the Reagan and Bush administrations, supported political and popular resistance to the PRK government, which was headed by Khmer Rouge defectors. In February 1991, China announced that it would resume military aid to the Khmer Rouge. The United States, in an effort to assure the international community that it would not tolerate the return of Pol Pot to power, suspended all aid to the non-communist resistance because of its cooperation with the Khmer Rouge.<sup>[[2]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/t-nsiad-90-63.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101004254/https://kh.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/book_us_cambodia_relations.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137364098_5)</sup></sup>
 
- There has been an increasing number of US veterans alleging exposure to Herbicide Orange while serving at military installations in Okinawa during the Vietnam Era. Some specific allegations published by the The Japan Times and other news outlets: Herbicide Orange and tactical herbicides were tested and evaluated in the jungle areas of Okinawa in 1961 – 1962; Beginning in 1962 in Project AGILE, Herbicide Orange and other tactical herbicides were shipped to or through, unloaded on, or used in Okinawa by the US Department of Defense during the Vietnam War; Shipments of the remaining surplus inventory of “25,000 barrels” of Herbicide Orange from Vietnam were sent to Okinawa prior to shipment to Johnston Island in 1971 during Operation RED HAT; Large quantities of Herbicide Orange were buried “in and around Chatan Town at Hamby Air Field” , and/or “buried at White Beach near the Machinato Supply Depot (Service Area)”, and/or “buried near the Futenma Air Station near the city of Ginowan”; Numerous US Vietnam-era veterans stationed in Okinawa handled and sprayed Herbicide Orange, or were witnesses to it being sprayed by a C-123; and, Some veterans stationed at Kadena Air Base cleaned the C-123 aircraft contaminated from spraying Herbicide Orange. However, an independent, comprehensive investigation concluded, "after an extensive search of all known and available records, there were no documents found that validated the allegations that Herbicide Orange was involved in any of these events, nor were there records to validate that Herbicide Orange was shipped to or through, unloaded, used or buried on Okinawa."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111003/http://denix.osd.mil/shf/upload/Allegations-of-Herbicide-Orange-on-Okinawa-January-2013.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Arc light missions in Cambodia adhered to the laws of war, under strict ROE to protect civilians. An internal study found, 
"Forward air controllers and fighter pilots followed normal in-country Rules of Engagement and operating procedures, exercising special care to avoid dropping ordnance on the noncombatant populace....  The FAC and fighter pilots were to follow normal in-country Rules of Engagement and operating procedures and were cautioned to exercise extreme vigilance to avoid dropping ordnance on the noncombatant populace." and, "The uncertainty of friendly locations and the absolute necessity to avoid noncombatant casualties delayed clearances and required some fighters to hold 15 to 30 minutes."

  That, "Restrictions for ARC LIGHT strikes were a minimum of one kilometer from the nearest noncombatants, not less than three kilometers from friendly combatants, and they were to avoid monuments, temples, and other cultural landmarks." And "If noncombatants were present, the strike was not to be conducted until the inhabitants had been warned by loudspeakers or leaflets to leave the area. Strikes were prohibited on 15 areas of cultural value to the Cambodian people, unless the target were requested and validated by FANK."<sup>[[1]](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA486570.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/195840/arc-light/)</sup></sup>

- Between 1964 and 1975, it is claimed that the US bombing campaign led to a poverty trap in Vietnam. However, the academic literature disputes this unfounded claim.
  "U.S. bombing does not have negative impacts on local poverty rates, consumption levels, infrastructure, literacy or population density through 2002. This finding indicates that even the most intense bombing in human history did not generate local poverty traps in Vietnam."<sup>[[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387810000817)</sup></sup> 
  
-  In 1998, CNN and Time alleged that during the Vietnam war, a US Special Forces unit was sent into Laos to hunt down US defectors—by killing an entire village of civilians, and using Sarin gas to finish them off, under "Operation Tailwind. "This sensational headline spurred two independent reviews: One by CNN, the other by the Pentagon that ordered the Army, Air Force and JCS to conduct investigations each: After interviewing pilots, planners, and all else involved, as well as extensive document review: All found the allegation baseless. Operation Tailwind was a rescue mission of Special Forces personnel. They deployed tear gas to suppress enemy fire, and recover their men. The review also confirmed that the US never deployed and chemical or biological weapons to Southeast Asia.

- It is charged by political pundits that the US Military during the Vietnam war, the stratergy was strategy of civilian slaughter sanctioned by American leaders—not only is this contradicted by the Rules of Engagement, as detailed in the following sections—but as  Fred L. Borch, a Military Historian & Archivist finds, "The vast majority of professional historians reject this view; they do not find that the historical record supports the conclusion that war crimes resulted from institutional flaws in the Army and its culture. In his highly acclaimed America in Vietnam, political scientist Guenter Lewy examined American strategy and tactics in Vietnam between 1961 and 1975, and analyzed hundreds of after action reports of military operations, command directive, field reports, and staff studies of pacification efforts. He also looked at courts-martial records and war crimes investigations. Lewy concluded that “charges of officially condoned illegal and grossly illegal conduct are without substance.” As Lewy demonstrates, the Army did not ignore misconduct by its Soldiers. On the contrary, the Army “kept statistics on the number of [war crimes] allegations made and their disposition.” For Lewy, this was proof that the Army as an institution was not turning a blind eye to war crimes committed by Americans in uniform. In Vietnam, senior commanders in fact took their responsibilities under the law of armed conflict seriously."<sup>[[1]](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/america-in-vietnam-9780195027327?cc=cz&lang=en&#)</sup></sup>

  In Law at War: Vietnam 1964-1973, an official study published by the Army’s Center of Military History, author George S. Prugh explains that the Commander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), considered creating special war crimes teams (to both investigate and prosecute these offenses). Ultimately, however, General William C. Westmoreland decided that this was not needed since the laws prohibiting war crimes were clear and the administrative and judicial machinery for investigating and punishing such offenses was sufficient. Westmoreland did, however, establish detailed rules governing the investigation of war crimes. Of particular importance is MACV Directive 20-4, which not only required the reporting of any war crime alleged to have been committed by U.S. personnel, but made it a criminal offense to fail to make such report. Finally, it was American military lawyers in Vietnam who were responsible for convincing their South Vietnamese counterparts that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were applicable to the conflict (thereby ensuring that international law governed the treatment of enemy combatants), and that it was Army lawyers who, intent on complying with the Conventions, authored rules governing the treatment of detained persons, including innocent civilians and civil defendants."<sup>[[2]](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/law-at-war/law-at-war.pdf)</sup></sup> 

  In 1973, Mr. Gerald Greven and Robert Dickey, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, alleged that US forces bombed a hospital around April-May 1969, in war zone D, South Vietnam, and that attacking hospitals was condoned. However, several reviews into the allegation found no evidence, and indeed—only information to the contrary, concluding, "It was United States , MACV, and Service policy to adhere to the laws of war, including not only the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Convention, but also those found in Hague Conventions Number IV and those established by customary international law. In addition, specific restrictions were imposed on our forces in South Vietnam that went beyond these Conventions. These restrictions, imposed to minimize civilian casualties, reduce the chance of an inadvertent strike into an inhabited area, protect religious monuments, public buildings, and areas of cultural interest, were applicable to forces in the field and to all levels of command in the target selection process. The policies of the Services do not support a conclusion that bombing of hospitals or other facilities protected by the Geneva Conventions would be condoned. On the contrary, we may have suffered additional casualties because of our self-imposed restrictions."<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/hospital-bombing-investigation-Nam)</sup></sup>

- During the Vietnam war, the US deployed herbicides to allow better troop movement in the jungle. This was known as Operation Ranch Hand.
Unknown to the US, one of its agents, agent orange, was toxic. Agent Orange was actually safe, however, a contamination issue occurred during the manufacture of 2,4,5,T. This was what was toxic: 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Contamination was between less than 0.05 to almost 50 parts per million, with a mean of about 2 parts per million.<sup>[[1]](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780306422478)</sup></sup> As noted by the National Academy of Sciences, "Until early 1973, there were no analytical techniques available with sensitivity and specificity sufficient to detect the extremely small quantities of TCDD likely to be present in the environment."<sup>[[2]](https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/items/show/1318)</sup></sup> This, of course, means that the contamination of TCDD couldn't be detected between 1961 and 1971. Allegations that it was used to harm/kill combatants or civilians is false.<sup>[[3]](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/98481.pdf)</sup></sup> The US did deploy one of its agents briefly_ to target _few, select_ crops belonging to the viet cong. The Americans were very reluctant to do this, however, South Vietnam insisted its use. The US only accepted under very strict controls & criteria, and if the South Government would guarantee humanitarian supplies should it be needed.<sup>[[4]](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/28/2001329797/-1/-1/0/AFD-100928-054.pdf)</sup></sup> Some will point to an article by the NYT, suggesting that the US knew of the toxicity of the Dioxin, and its presence in Agent Orange, according to Dow in a Court filing. The supposed evidence is a Rand report, according to the filing. However: The Rand report doesn't mention TCDD anywhere. The report also does not examine the toxicity of the only compound mentioned,  2,4-d. It's a survey of defectors, who report on what they believe to be the impact of various tactics. But again, this is a completely seperate compound.<sup>[[5]](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2007/RM5446-1.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Napalm, Cluster munitions and other incendiary bombs were used in Vietnam. Their deployment was subject to careful approval on select military targets only, and after CIVCAS mitigation efforts were completed, thus satisfactory to the Geneva Conventions. Interestingly, "Available factual data suggest that the air delivery of the fire bomb on the target can be accomplished with extreme accuracy in close air support of troops on the ground. Far example, fire bombs in this role are generally dropped from an altitude of 50-350 feet when the attack aircraft is not further than 1,000 feet from the target. Delivery accuracy under typical conditions is said to be within 100 feet with an area of effectiveness, elliptical in shape, approximately 120 meters long and 25 meters wide. Alternative weapons are indicated as having substantially larger maximum effective areas, thus tending to disprove the contention that the fire bomb is a weapon with an unusually large area of effectiveness with attendant indiscriminate effects against civilians and civilian property."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220131094000/https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/2251871/View+the+PDF/ee82f732-b0b4-4275-b230-5be04ad16474#page=101)</sup></sup>  

- In July 1972, the Hanoi propaganda effort ramped up, claiming the US deliberately attacked several Dikes, causing civilian casualties. However, an independent, internal review confirmed this not to be the case. "A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital dike system. A few dikes have been hit, apparently by stray bombs directed at military-associated targets nearby. The observable damage is minor and no major dike has been breached."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T00875R001700040062-8.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1965 and 1971, US bombing of Cambodia, such as MENU, with Cambodian consent to stop Viet Cong forces from operating within the territory, resulted in only 343 civilian deaths and 639 wounded, according to a JSC study.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/LOC-HAK-449-5-3-5.pdf)</sup></sup> It is also argued by some that the Communist attack on civilians in Saigon on June 7, 1969 were retalitory for US bombing their forces in Cambodia. However, a review of attacks confirms this narrative is false.<sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/LOC-HAK-553-4-6-7.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/cambodia-laos-review)</sup></sup> During 1969-73 in Cambodia, it was difficult for reporters in Phnom Penh to estimate the proportion of civilian casualties caused by air operations. There is no doubt that most of those casualties occurred in 1973. Pol Pot’s forces laid siege to Phnom Penh while cease-fire agreements in Vietnam and Cambodia permitted American air power to focus on Cambodia. Reporters in Phnom Penh could see that many nearby villages had been destroyed by bombing. According to the American air commander, General Vogt, those villages had already been vacated by civilians fleeing into the city. His forces were using a range of intelligence sources (including infrared sensors) to determine which villages were occupied. The worst error occurred at Neak Luong, where more than a hundred civilians were killed when a B-52 crew failed to calculate an offset and dropped on a beacon in the town.<sup>[[4]](https://archive.org/details/us-mil-doc-excerpts)</sup></sup>

- Operation Linebacker 1, from May 9 to October 23, 1972 and Operation Linebacker 2, from December 18 to December 29, 1972 were bombing campaigns against North Vietnam. North Vietnam illegally invaded South Vietnam, which triggered Operation Linebacker 1, targeting their military supply lines, etc. This was a successful effort in forcing the North to the peace table. However, the North Vietnam Government stalled peace talks, while trying to secretly build their forces. This prompted the Nixon Admin to begin Linebacker 2. A shorter campaign that while effective, was surrounded by disinformation alleging "indiscriminate targeting of civilians". An independent assessment concludes, "that the Linebacker campaigns were militarily effective and that, had AFP 110-31 been in effect in 1972, the campaigns, as they were actually conducted, would have conformed to the pamphlet's restrictions on aerial bombardment. These campaigns demonstrate that the pamphlet's rules on aerial bombardment are practical and can be complied with, given the proper technology and a conscious effort by commanders, their staffs, and aircrews."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA191278/page/n1/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
 
   A scholarly paper from W. Hays Park, a world-leading LOAC expert, also confirms these operations were in compliance with international law, and details the efforts to mitigate collateral damage and civilian casualties. He concludes, "Both Linebacker campaigns were also conducted with an acute awareness by the military of its responsibilities under the law of war, with mission parameters well within the prohibitions of the law. Although unprecedented in the degree of precaution taken by an attacker to minimize collateral injury to the civilian population of an enemy, each campaign was successful in attaining its objectives."<sup>[[1]](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/1983_Vol34_No1-6/1983_Vol34_No2.pdf)</sup></sup> 


- The US had 0 involvement in the Bangladesh genocide of 1971. The US provided only humanitarian aid to both parties, while US Military sales (lethal and non-lethal) and exports ceased to Pakistan.<sup>[[1]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-173651-096593.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-173651-091331.pdf)</sup></sup> The Blood telegram was also refuted by its flaws of its assumptions. Its only positive was it helped create the "dissent channel" in the State Department. <sup>[[3]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve07/d129)</sup></sup> However, due to the complexities of diplomacy, I'll quote extensively from the State Department Office of the Historian summary of events:

  The trigger for the crisis in 1971 in East Pakistan was the announcement by President Yahya Khan on March 1 that the scheduled meeting of the recently elected National Assembly would be postponed indefinitely. The National Assembly was scheduled to draft a new constitution for Pakistan to mark an end to martial law government. Because of the overwhelming electoral success in East Pakistan of Bengali nationalists, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League, the constitution was also expected to reflect their demand for virtual autonomy for East Pakistan. The Consulate General in Dacca reported on March 2 that "It would be impossible to over-estimate the sense of anger, shock and frustration which has gripped the east wing" as a result of the announcement.  President Yahya's announcement was followed by demonstrations in East Pakistan, and on March 7 Mujibur Rahman called for a "peaceful non-cooperation" movement patterned on Mahatma Gandhi's passive resistance movement in India. The martial law government responded by airlifting troops to Dacca to double the size of the 15,000-man garrison. Undaunted, Mujibur Rahman announced on March 15 that, on the basis of the December election, his party, the Awami League, was taking over the administration of East Pakistan.  On March 25, the army arrested Mujibur and moved to suppress what was viewed in Islamabad as a secessionist movement. The initial reaction in Washington to the emerging crisis was to avoid involvement in the internal politics of Pakistan. When the National Security Council's (NSC) Senior Review Group members considered the situation on March 6 they agreed with Under Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson that it called for "massive inaction" on the part of the United States. That conclusion was confirmed on March 26 when the NSC's crisis management team, the Washington Special Actions Group (WSAG), considered the crisis for the first time. Kissinger led a discussion in which there was general agreement to maintain a hands-off policy toward what was viewed as a developing civil war. The United States did not want to be open to the charge that it had encouraged the break-up of Pakistan.

  On April 6, most members of the Consulate General in Dacca signed a dissent channel message to Washington. The message called upon the United States Government to condemn the "indiscriminate killing" of the populace of East Pakistan by the army. Condemnation of genocide, they argued, should outweigh a reluctance to intervene in the internal affairs of another country. Consul General Archer Blood endorsed the dissent.  In Washington, Secretary of State Rogers raged over the "miserable" cable from Dacca.  Kissinger told Nixon on April 12 that the " Dacca consulate is in open rebellion." Nixon again concluded that it would be a mistake to become involved: "The people who bitch about Vietnam bitch about it because we intervened in what they say is a civil war. Now some of the same bastards...want us to intervene here—both civil wars." As early as April 12, a Special National Intelligence Estimate, produced at Department of State request, concluded that prospects were "poor" that the Pakistani army would be able to exert effective control over East Pakistan. The estimate also concluded that India would foster and support Bengali insurgency and contribute to the likelihood that an independent Bangladesh would emerge from the developing conflict.  There were few illusions in Washington from an early stage in the crisis about the probable outcome of the civil war. At most, Yahya Khan and his government could hope to negotiate a settlement premised upon autonomy for East Pakistan within a loosely unified state. With authorization from Washington, United States officials encouraged efforts by representatives of the Awami League operating out of Calcutta, who styled themselves the new government of Bangladesh, to negotiate such a compromise settlement. There was an inclination within the U.S. Government, particularly within the Department of State, to bring pressure on the Government of Pakistan to restrain the army and establish a regional civil administration that might win back some Bengali support and halt the flow of refugees. Nixon's response was given in a handwritten instruction: "To all hands. Don't squeeze Yahya at this time." Why was Nixon so concerned not to squeeze Yahya? On May 7, Kissinger entertained Ambassador Joseph Farland on Nixon's instructions in Palm Springs, California, where Farland had gone under guise of personal business to meet privately with Kissinger. Kissinger told Farland that for some time he had been sending messages to China through the Pakistani Government without the knowledge of Farland or anyone in his embassy. Farland was made privy to the exchange in order to prepare for Kissinger's trip to China via Pakistan in July. Only Farland was to know about the cover Pakistan was providing for this initiative, or that President Yahya had facilitated it with the Chinese leaders.

  On May 13, Prime Minister Gandhi wrote to President Nixon about the "carnage in East Bengal" which "disturbed the Indian people deeply." She added that the impact of millions of refugees imposed an enormous burden upon India and impacted heavily upon its economy. There were by Indian count over 2 million refugees in West Bengal and the flow was increasing. The situation, she warned, could become explosive. Indian Ambassador L. K. Jha warned Kissinger on May 21 that without evidence that Pakistan would reverse the military repression and restore the political rights of the population of East Pakistan, there was strong support in India for the idea of arming the refugees and sending them back as guerrillas.  By the end of May, reports were coming to Washington about Indian forces gathering along the border with East Pakistan. The United States passed the word to India that it was opposed to military intervention in the civil war. Nixon said that if India intervened militarily "by God we will cut off economic aid."  In a subsequent conversation with Kissinger on May 26, Nixon said that "the goddamn Indians" were promoting another war. Kissinger agreed: "they are the most aggressive goddamn people around."

  Nixon and Kissinger, who managed the United States response to the crisis... met in Washington in June with Indian Foreign Minister Swaran Singh and attempted to persuade him that the civil war need not evolve into conflict between India and Pakistan. When Nixon met with Singh on June 16, he tried to defuse the crisis by offering $70 million in humanitarian assistance to help offset the expenses involved in dealing with the refugees. Singh, who expanded on the "tremendous problems" created for India by the often destitute refugees, expressed appreciation for the offer but insisted that the fundamental question was how to stop the flow of refugees. It would not be possible, he said, to "buy the problem away." Nixon's view of the emerging crisis was expressed in an NSC meeting on July 16. The Indians... he felt that they would like nothing more than to take advantage of the opportunity to destroy Pakistan. Kissinger agreed that India seemed bent upon war. He thought that China would enter any such war on Pakistan's side, but concluded that might not dissuade India. Kissinger felt that if the United States did not "over-power the question of war, India would slide into it." On August 3, Secretary Rogers sent telegrams to New Delhi and Islamabad expressing concern about cross-border shelling by both Indian and Pakistani forces in East Pakistan and Indian support for Bengali guerrillas being infiltrated into East Pakistan. He instructed the embassies to urge restraint in the face of the strong possibility of war.

  Reports reached Washington in early October that Indian and Pakistani artillery were massing along the border of East Pakistan. The expectation was that the coming end of the monsoon season would create the conditions necessary for offensive operations and could bring the crisis to a head. The embassies in New Delhi and Islamabad were instructed to urge that cross-border operations be prevented. On October 8, Kissinger warned Ambassador Jha that if India started a war the United States would cut off all economic assistance. On the same day, Ambassador Beam called on Gromyko to emphasize U.S. concern about the mounting danger of war. The United States tried in mid-October to build on Foreign Minister Singh's assurance that India would not initiate hostilities by proposing that both sides withdraw their forces from the border to the nearest military bases. Pakistan accepted the proposal but India hedged and said that such a move would leave India at a disadvantage in that Pakistan's bases were closer to the border. Nixon put this proposal to Indira Gandhi when she visited Washington on November 4 as part of her tour of foreign capitals to try to generate support for India's position. He also told her that the United States would find the initiation of hostilities between India and Pakistan to be totally unacceptable. In a stiff meeting, Gandhi denied sponsoring the Mukti Bahini guerrillas and denied that Indian forces were poised to initiate a conflict. In this and in their subsequent meeting on the following day, she failed to respond to Nixon's proposal for a mutual withdrawal. Nixon and Kissinger subsequently discussed the exchanges with Gandhi. Kissinger's assessment was that "They are plotting a war." He felt that Nixon had given her a warm enough reception that she could not complain that the United States was anti-Indian. Nixon agreed.

  Open warfare erupted in East Pakistan on November 22 when India launched an offensive with two divisions supported by armor. The WSAG, which had been meeting with increasing frequency to assess the crisis, began almost daily meetings to map advice for the President. Indian forces pushed quickly into East Pakistan while Mukti Bahini guerrilla forces acted in support. Nixon's response was to cut off economic assistance to India, but, as Rogers told him, the leverage the United States could bring to bear with such a move was not liable to be effective. Still, Nixon instructed: "In terms of the merits of the situation, to the extent that we can tilt it toward Pakistan, I would prefer to play that." Pakistan sought to offset the pressure on its forces in East Pakistan by launching an attack on December 3 from West Pakistan. Pakistan's air force struck at six Indian airfields in Kashmir and the Punjab and Pakistani artillery began shelling at several points along the border. Kissinger told Nixon that the fighting in the west had been initiated by India. Nixon ordered a hold placed on $90 million in pending letters of credit for India.

  On December 4, United Nations Ambassador George Bush introduced a resolution in the Security Council which called for a cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan from each other's territories, and encouraged both countries to avail themselves of the Secretary General's offer to mediate. The resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. On December 7, the United States sponsored a similar resolution in the General Assembly, where the Soviet Union could not exercise a veto, and it was adopted by a wide margin. The United States recognized, however, that the United Nations could do little to control the fighting on the subcontinent. Accordingly, Nixon and Kissinger increased the pressure on the Soviet Union to rein in India. On December 5, Kissinger called in Soviet Chargé Yuli Vorontsov and told him that Nixon could not understand how the United States and the Soviet Union could work toward détente on a variety of issues while Moscow was encouraging Indian aggression against Pakistan. Kissinger said that Nixon invited Brezhnev to join in the effort to put an end to the fighting on the subcontinent and return to working on a broad improvement in relations. Kissinger warned that the United States viewed the situation in South Asia as a "watershed" in U.S.-Soviet relations.Nixon underlined the points made by Kissinger to Vorontsov in a letter to Brezhnev on December 6. He warned that if India achieved its ends militarily, with Soviet support, it would have an adverse effect on U.S.-Soviet relations.Nixon and Kissinger agreed, when they discussed the crisis on December 6, that it was necessary to take a hard line with the Soviet Union. Kissinger said that it was the kind of signal the Soviets understood. "You'll be better off six months from now," he added. "If they lose respect for us now they'll put it to us."

  New evidence suggested to Nixon and Kissinger that rather than being restrained by Moscow, India was contemplating expanded military operations against West Pakistan. An intelligence report of a briefing that Gandhi gave in early December indicated that India enjoyed strong support from the Soviet Union, which had promised to counter-balance any move China might make against India in support of Pakistan. With that much support, Gandhi outlined her war aims: she would not accept a settlement until Bangladesh was liberated, the "southern area of Azad Kashmir" was liberated, and the Pakistani armored and air force strength was destroyed to prevent any future challenge to India. Nixon and Kissinger took this as proof that India planned not only to foster the independence of East Pakistan, but to use the opportunity of the crisis to inflict a crushing military defeat on Pakistan, which would lead to the breakup of West Pakistan. Kissinger attributed to the Gandhi government the goal of Balkanizing West Pakistan. If the crisis resulted in the dismemberment of Pakistan, Kissinger worried that China might conclude that the United States was "just too weak" to prevent the humiliation of an ally. He felt that the Chinese would then look to other options "to break their encirclement." He concluded that the situation represented "a big watershed." To increase pressure on the Soviet Union to restrain India, Kissinger advised that it might be necessary to call the projected summit meeting with the Soviet Union into question. Nixon agreed: "Maybe we have to put it to the Russians and say we have to cancel the summit." Kissinger advised Nixon to "play it out toughly" and anticipated that if a summit meeting did in the end prove possible, it would be one that Nixon could attend with his head up.

  On December 9, Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms warned the WSAG that Pakistani forces in East Pakistan were crumbling. When Nixon and Kissinger met in the Oval Office on December 9 to discuss the crisis, they had in mind the deteriorating situation in East Pakistan and the intelligence report on Prime Minister Gandhi's early December briefing, which they took to mean that after achieving victory in the east, India would shift its forces to the west and dismember Pakistan. At that point, Nixon decided to introduce the carrier Enterprise and its supporting vessels into the Bay of Bengal to apply military pressure on India. The rather transparent cover story was that the Enterprise was moving from Southeast Asia to the Bay of Bengal to help protect and withdraw U.S. citizens from East Pakistan. Nixon decided to pose an implied military threat to India. Later in the afternoon of December 9, Nixon applied further pressure on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Minister of Agriculture, Vladimir Matskevich, was in Washington and Nixon received him for what Matskevich assumed was a courtesy call. Instead, to his surprise, Nixon delivered a stern warning that the crisis on the subcontinent was poisoning the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. He asked "are short-term gains for India worth jeopardizing Soviet relations with the U.S.?" (257) On Nixon's instructions, Kissinger saw Vorontsov on December 10 and warned him that the United States had "treaty" obligations to Pakistan, established in 1959 and confirmed by President Kennedy, that required the United States to come to Pakistan's assistance in the event of aggression. The United States, he warned, intended to honor those commitments.

  The other element that Nixon wanted to see come into play in a belated effort to prevent India from crushing Pakistan was a threat from China. In a conversation with Kissinger in the Oval Office on December 10, Nixon instructed Kissinger to ask the Chinese to move some forces toward the frontier with India. "Threaten to move forces or move them, Henry, that's what they must do now." With those instructions, Kissinger went to New York the evening of December 10 and met with Huang Hua, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. He briefed Huang Hua on Gandhi's position and on the threat to West Pakistan as perceived in Washington. He told Huang Hua about the carrier force moving toward the Bay of Bengal. And, using diplomatic language, he relayed Nixon's request for Chinese military moves in support of Pakistan. Kissinger added that Nixon wanted China to know that if China took such action, the United States would oppose the efforts of others to interfere with China. There were no qualifications to Kissinger's diplomatically worded but clear assurance that the United States would be prepared for a military confrontation with the Soviet Union if the Soviet Union attacked China.

  On December 12, Nixon had to contemplate the implications of the assurance offered to the Chinese two days earlier. During the course of a conversation between Nixon and Kissinger in the Oval Office about the need for a military move by China to reinforce the impact of the arrival of the U.S. carrier off East Pakistan, Kissinger's deputy Alexander Haig entered with word that the Chinese wanted to have a meeting in New York. That was startling news. Kissinger said the Chinese had never initiated contact in New York. Suddenly it seemed likely that the China was going to move militarily against India. That raised the likelihood that the Soviet Union would be given an excuse to strike China. Kissinger said: "If the Soviets move against them and we don't do anything, we will be finished." Nixon asked: "So what do we do if the Soviets move against them? Start lobbing nuclear weapons in, is that what you mean?" Kissinger responded: "If the Soviets move against them in these conditions and succeed, that will be the final showdown...and if they succeed we will be finished." He added that "if the Russians get away with facing down the Chinese and the Indians get away with licking the Pakistanis...we may be looking down the gun barrel." In the end, they concluded that the projected confrontation with the Soviet Union would not involve a nuclear exchange. Kissinger felt that to preserve credibility, the United States, if necessary, would have to support China with conventional forces: "We have to put forces in. We may have to give them bombing assistance." Kissinger saw the danger of war between the Soviet Union and China as a strong possibility, with the Soviets looking for "a pretext to wipe out China," but Nixon concluded at the end of the discussion that "Russia and China aren't going to go to war."

  Nixon's prediction was borne out when it developed that China had no intention of threatening military action against India. Pakistani forces surrendered in East Pakistan on December 16 and India announced a cease-fire. With a nudge from Ambassador Farland, President Yahya accepted the cease-fire."<sup>[[4]](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/xi/45650.htm)</sup></sup>

  
- June, 1970, local media in the village of Snoul, it was alleged that US troops burned a huts and engaged in looting en masse. However, an investigation revealed this was not so. Some troops did try to take a few drinks, however NCOs prevented this from happening. Some journalists try to suggest the investigation blamed civilian press for the looting—however, the investigation said no such thing. It merely suggested it was a possability.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/confidential-army-report-snuol-cambodia)</sup></sup>

- In 1970, in Cambodia, the CIA had no involvement in Prince Sihanouk's vote of no confidence. The list's own wiki citation even admits there is no evidence. It is alleged this had US involvement because of the view from the US that Cambodia was being used to supply weapons to the VC/NVA. However, a detailed study by Historian Ahern finds that the CIA, from 1965-1969 was split on the evidence intelligence suggested of such covert support by Sihanouk. Indeed, CIA scrapped all prior intel in 1969 to study from scratch, "OER undertook a comprehensive review, not only of the evidence but also of its own analytical methodology. Proceeding from primary reporting, the new effort would ignore all published analyses. Its objectivity would be assured by having it conducted by an officer without previous exposure to Cambodian analysis." However, ONE still leaned that the evidence wasn't enough, and downplayed key intelligence concerning the overland route. By 1970, however, the question was settled: Sihanouk had abandoned neutrality. Indeed, internal biases of sympathy existed in the CIA towards Prince Sihanouk, even as early as 1964: "Several participants in the debate later came to see individual and institutional bias as encouraging resistance to serious consideration of Sihanoukville as a major transit point for arms. [redacted] believed that service in Cambodia tended to generate sympathy for Sihanouk's position, as the Prince struggled to save his country with a neutralist balancing act. [redacted] remembered his own stance as open to Sihanouk's complicity in the arms traffic, but he agreed that pro-Sihanouk feeling was common [redacted]. But the phenomenon existed also at CIA. [redacted] remembered having absorbed the sentiment in OCI in the mid-1960s. He also recalled a visit to DDI Ray Cline's office, sometime in 1964, where Cline advised him to "take it easy on the Cambodians." [redacted] interpreted this cryptic guidance as suggesting he "cut Sihanouk some slack" when interpreting allegations of collusion with the VC/NVA that were already circulating." Official North Vietnamese histories published in 1994 and 1995 confirmed the use of Cambodia in trafficking: Chief editor, Nguyen Duy Tuong History of the Annamite Mountain Troops of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, "that the Lao Dong Party's Central Office for South Vietnam set up Rear Services Group 17 in July 1966 "in the friendly nation of Cambodia." Under the name "Hak Ly Company," it "established purchasing offices in a number of different areas in Cambodia." and Col. Gen. Tran Van Quang, Review of the Resistance War Against the Americans, "between 1966 and 1969, we shipped 21,400 tones of supplies through the port of Sihanoukville and paid the government more than 50 millionUS dollars in port fees and transportation charges."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/4_GOOD_QUESTIONS_WRONG_ANSWERS.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The US did not instigate or participate in the 1958 Indonesian rebellion, contrary to historical revisionists. In early 1957, the US  provided financial assistance to a group of dissident Indonesian Army Officers on the island of Sumatra, to maintain them as a force in being. By 25 September 1957, the National Security Council had become concerned with the course of events in Indonesia and on its recommendation President Eisenhower authorized the Agency to employ "all feasible covert means" to support the dissidents. Planning for increased aid of all types began immediately, and in January 1958, a US arms shipment for the dissidents arrived in Sumatra. Then on 10 February, the situation came to a head. While Sukarno was out of the country on a state visit to Japan, the dissident Army colonels, without consulting CIA, organized  a Revolutionary Council in Padang, West Sumatra, and demanded the abolition of President Sukarno's "guided democracy" (a euphemism for a brutal dictatorship). Five days later, this council proclaimed itself the new "Revolutionary  Government" of Indonesia. President Sukarno's armed forces responded swiftly to this threat. In late February the Indonesian Air Force begun bombing dissident strongholds, and by mid-March government forces were conducting an all-out air-sea-land drive against the rebel-held areas in central Sumatra. Only after this blood-thirsty, and indiscriminate bombing campaign overreaction by the regime, did US volunteers aide the dissidents in a handful of bombing missions.<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2014-004-doc01.pdf#page=220)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040006-9.pdf)</sup></sup>

She concluded that while Peking had probable learned of the Sukarno/PKI plan, as indeed it must have through agent penetration of the Palace and the PKI, the Chinese did not instigate the plot or participate in carrying it out. The same conclusion is implicit in an earlier article in _studies in Intelligence_ in _The September 30 Movement_ by John T. Pizzicaro. Like us, the Chinese knew something important was imminent.

As he points out, "the names I gave were based entirely—I repeat entirely—on the Indonesia Communist press and were available to everyone. This was a senior cadre system of the PKI—a few thousand at most out of the 3.5 million claimed party members.” Martens stressed that these lists of PKI members were “not party rank and file.” Martens also stated categorically in his letter that, “I and I alone decided to pass those ‘lists’ to the non-Communist forces. I neither sought nor was given permission to do so by Ambassador Marshall Green or any other embassy official.” Martens concluded with the statement that he did not turn over classified information nor was he the head of an Embassy group that spent 2 years compiling the lists as stated in the article in The Washington Post. He stated that there was no such group." <sup>[[6]](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v26/d185)</sup></sup> Yes, the CIA did produced estimates of the death toll, long after the fact.

- The Vietnam war and the US' entire air campaign; counter to many historical revisionists, was actually hampered by strict Rules of Engagement that often left the Military allowing the Vietcong to remain safe, even though they're far clear of any surrounding civilian populations. In another scholarly paper by a world-leading legal expert and practitioner, it was found while studying Air Force ROEs, "the policy of gradualism, implemented by the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1968, resulted in ROE of unprecedented detail and restrictiveness."<sup>[[1]](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Rules-of-Engagement-for-Land-Forces%3A-A-Matter-of-Martins/7e772b364572c7a5efe69de72538444c85cf099e)</sup></sup> Indeed, an internal air force study prior concluded the same, "military barracks were prohibited.

- Between 1942 and 1960, it has been charged that the United States influenced the Philippines via its "capitalistic elite," on US foreign policy. This hypothesis has been dispelled by a close and critical examination of US and Philippine government archives by world-leading historian, Nick Cullather in his monograph, 'Illusions of Influence The Political Economy of United States-Philippines Relations, 1942-1960.' "Based on extensive research in U.S. and Philippine archives, Cullather's study exposes the limits of American influence with its former colony. Its thesis, simply stated, is that a succession of Philippine presidents consistently thwarted U.S. policy initiatives, particularly ones aimed at reforming the Philippine economy, because their agendas differed from those of U.S. administrations. Whereas American policy makers wanted to promote economic growth and to eliminate corruption in order to insure the stability of the new, strategically important nation-state, Philippine leaders aimed, above all, to reward domestic political allies with economic advantages and to promote the Philippine manufacturing sector, however inefficient, at the expense of Chinese and foreign competitors. Cullather explodes a number of myths in this book. He shows, for example, that the close economic ties established between the United States and the Philippines after 1946-including a preferential tariff system were not imposed on an unwilling Philippine government. In fact, Philippine leaders favored those ties, believing that the country's economic health depended on them. Furthermore, they were approved over the strong objections of the U.S. State Department, which opposed special bilateral arrangements. Cullather recounts, too, the largely successful efforts of the administrations of Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino to resist U.S. efforts to dictate policy. Perhaps his most arresting findings relate to Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, typically depicted as a creature of C.I.A. operative Edward Lansdale. But, as Cullather demonstrates, Magsaysay adeptly used his close U.S. connections to enlarge his patronage base and gave little attention to land and tax reform programs favored by the U.S. government because they threatened to undermine Magsaysay's alliances with planters, industrialists, and warlords. Even on regional security matters, Magsaysay was anything but a puppet, effectively resisting U.S. pressure to recognize South Vietnam and to grant additional land for military bases. Rather than being manipulated by Lansdale, Magsaysay was a master manipulator."<sup>[[1]](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/101/1/262/18599)</sup></sup> " This well-written and instructive book succeeds admirably in its objectives. First, it convincingly challenges conventional wisdom that Washington easily dominated postwar United States-Philippines relations. Second, it demonstrates that world systems analysis and dependency theory need to take into account more fully the nuances of a client-patron relationship. Third, it shows that when historians of diplomacy venture overseas to research foreign archives and to learn about foreign cultures, they may discover that American influence—so often portrayed as fact in United States documents—is in many ways illusory.<sup>[[2]](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/82/3/1275/676232?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1951, the Dalai Lama pleaded with the international community publicly, and to the US secretly, to aid the Tibetan people against the illegal, genocidal imperialistic campaign of the Chinese communists in Tibet. Chinese psyops have attempted to tarnish the image of the Tibetans as religious bourgeoisie. Most Tibetans, however, are neither monks nor nobles but peasants, often tenants, or nomadic herders. As one of the leading historians on the CIA's aid to the Tibetan people notes, “In 1950 the Chinese came to Kham.” This was the opening sentence of what became a familiar litany to American officers who worked with the Tibetans on one of the more total and romantic programs of covert action undertaken by the Agency. With this simple description, the pragmatic Tibetans would proceed to make their case for American support in a common fight. The Tibetans told a story of how the Chinese were systematically setting out to destroytheir culture, particularly the religion around which their lives were organized. Like frontiersmen, they asked for help, not in terms of money or subsidies, but for arms and training so that they might fight their own fight. The Tibetans’ pleas fell on responsive ears within the U.S. Government. North Korea had invaded South Korea in June of that year and the U.S. Government was still smarting over the Chinese Communist takeover of the mainland the year before. When the Dalai Lama sent emissaries from Yatung, his temporary capital just across the Tibet-Sikkim border, they found willing negotiators within the American Embassy in India. The 15-year-old Dalai Lama had decided to come to Yatung after his plea to the United Nations in December 1950 had produced no helpful response. His advisors had been concerned that if he stayed in Lhasa he might be captured and the central figure of their civilization thereby be lost. The young ruler was faced with the decision of whether to return to Lhasa and attempt to alleviate the lot of his people by working with the Chinese, or to flee abroad where he and his ecclesiastical court might act as a rallying point for the resistance effort then being organized in eastern Tibet.

  The Dalai Lama made his way back up the Chumbi Valley in July 1952, and the U.S. promises of covert aid were shelved while the god-king attempted to reach an accommodation with the Chinese. Under the agreement which Tibetan representatives had signed under duress in the Dalai Lama’s absence in 1951, the Chinese extended their occupation throughout all of Tibet. Life under their rule became increasingly harsh. Various efforts which the Dalai Lama made both to mitigate this rule and to reform his own archaic government were frustrated by the Chinese. By 1956 the Dalai Lama had despaired of his ability to provide effective political rule to his country, and he considered withdrawal from all secular life. UN resolution of 21 October 1959 which deplored Chinese Communist violations of human rights in Tibet. 

  In the summer of 1961 the Dalai Lama announced plans for a new constitution. Tge Agency had encouraged this move by the Dalai Lama, and Ambassador Gross had drafted a preliminary document. The Dalai Lama modified this document to fit his idiom and ideas which were surprisingly liberal, particularly concerning his willingness to give up state lands and subject himself to a form of recall. His scattered constituents debated and voted on this constitution in refugee camps throughout India and Nepal for the following two years. The only popularly expressed reservations were that the Dalai Lama had granted too generous a constitution. The international community had been informed of this constituent process by an article by Ambassador Gross which appeared in the October edition of Foreign Affairs, By the time the UN again considered Tibet at its autumn 1961 session, the Tibetans had additional evidence to back their claim to political self- determination. On 20 December the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution renewing its call for the cessation of practices which deprived the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedom, including their right to self-determination. This was to be the height of UN support for Tibetan aspirations. Finally, our involvement was right for the times and the ideal we professed. The Tibetans never approached us as supplicants, but as fellow believers in similar democratic values who were temporary victims of a common enemy. They asked for the means to fight for their own cause, which they assumed was ours. Our willingness to respond to this appeal was noted by those other nations who were then judging our readiness to commit ourselves against our professions. It was an honorable operation."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/COVERT%20ACTION%20IN%20HIGH%20ALT%5B14688685%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20141013004630/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0005543224.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- In 1950, it was alleged that A US airstrike deliberately targeted South Korean refugees in the village of Nogeun-ri (No Gun Ri).
An independent and authoritative investigation summarised as follows: "Over the last year, the Review Team has conducted an exhaustive factual review by examining over a million documents from the National Archives, conducting interviews with approximately 200 American witnesses, and analyzing the interview transcripts and oral statements of approximately 75 Korean witnesses.  The U.S. Review Team also closely examined press reports, aerial imagery, and other forensic examination results.  This U.S. Report reflects the U.S. Review Team’s factual findings based upon all the evidence available on the incident. During late July 1950, Korean civilians were caught between withdrawing U.S. forces and attacking enemy forces.  As a result of U.S. actions during the Korean War in the last week of July 1950, Korean civilians were killed and injured in the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  The Review Team did not find that the Korean deaths and injuries occurred exactly as described in the Korean account.  To appraise these events, it is necessary to recall the circumstances of the period.  U.S. forces on occupation duty in Japan, mostly without training for, or experience in, combat were suddenly ordered to join ROK forces in defending against a determined assault by well-armed and well-trained NKPA forces employing both conventional and guerilla warfare tactics.  The U.S. troops had to give up position after position.  In the week beginning July 25, 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division, withdrawing from Yongdong toward the Naktong River, passed through the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  Earlier, roads and trails in South Korea had been choked with civilians fleeing south.  Disguised NKPA soldiers had mingled with these refugees.  U.S. and ROK commanders had published a policy designed to limit the threat from NKPA infiltrators, to protect U.S. forces from attacks from the rear, and to prevent civilians from interfering with the flow of supplies and troops.  The ROK National Police were supposed to control and strictly limit the movements of innocent refugees. In these circumstances, especially given the fact that many of the U.S. soldiers lacked combat-experienced officers and Non-commissioned officers, some soldiers may have fired out of fear in response to a perceived enemy threat without considering the possibility that they might be firing on Korean civilians."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20051028235056/http://www.army.mil/nogunri/)</sup></sup>

- In 1967, the South Vietnamese government operated a program called Phung Hoang or Phoenix.

As such, Phung Hoand represented an intelligence coordination mechanism—in the form of coordinating committees at the province, regional and national level; and intelligence and operations coordinating centers at the province and district level—which aimed at a united total governmental effort against the CVI. It was _not_ a program of assassination or terror in response to Communist terror, and the program did not authorise torture, brutality or cruel methods in the interrogation or handling of captives. The US further worked with the Government to make sure adequate, humane treatment as focal, observing fair concepts of due process and improve conditions of internment.<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001100060018-1.pdf)</sup> <sup>[[4]](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB284/3-CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf#page=287)</sup>

- 1955-1973. There were two phases of the US involvement in Laos. One was waged in the north to assure the independence, territorial integrity, and neutrality of the Laotian government, guaranteed by the 1954 and 1962 Geneva agreements. The other was waged in the south to arrest the infiltration of manpower and supplies from communist North Vietnam to the Viet Cong insurgents in non-communist South Vietnam, to which US forces were committed to minimizing civilian casualties via strict ROEs.

  The Geneva agreements of 1954, ending French control over Indochina, left the Kingdom of Laos a very fragile country, ruled by contesting factions. There were separate military groupings with the neutralists controlling the Royal Laotian Army (shortly renamed the Forces Armees du Royaume or FAR) and a Pathet Lao army occupying two northern provinces, Houa Phan, also called Samneua, and Phong Saly. The population of three million included a small, French-educated elite and numerous diverse, illiterate tribal groups who lived in isolated jungle and mountainous areas. The United States supported but did not sign the 1954 Geneva agreements. It nevertheless believed that the free world’s interest required keeping Laos and two other newly created Indochina states, South Vietnam and Cambodia, outside the orbit of Communist North Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union. The provisions applicable to Laos forbade the Vientiane government from entering into any foreign military alliance, called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops except a French military training mission, and limited the types and amount of military equipment that could be used by the small Royal Laotian Army of 10,000 men. Also established was an International Control Commission consisting of Indian, Canadian, and Polish representatives to ensure compliance with the provisions. Given Laos’s weaknesses, the impreciseness of some of the agreement’s provisions, and the suspicions in Washington of the intentions of Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow, enforcement of the agreements to assure Laos’s neutrality promised to be difficult. With few exceptions, the Pathet Lao barred the International Control Commission from entering its occupied areas (including several occasions firing on ICC helicopters), and Hanoi made no significant withdrawal of its North Vietnamese cadres engaged in training, equipping, and supporting their Pathet Lao allies.
  
  The pseudo-nationalist Communist insurgent group, the Pathet Lao, under the control of North Vietnam (in direct violation of the Geneva Accords), started an insurrection via a campaign of propaganda<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R000600080007-0.pdf)</sup></sup> and terrorism, to sway towards North Vietnam. Under SEATO, to which Laos was not party to, the United Stated provided non-military aid to the country to repel the Pathet Lao, in the form of the Program Evaluation Office (PEO), in compliance with the Geneva Agreement.<sup>[[2]](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/war_in_northern_laos.pdf)</sup></sup> In 1958, the CIA entered the scene: It begun two operations, one civic program to locally  encourage the government to focus on the welfare of rural populations and the working class and the other, focused on small, mobile units designed to operate in enemy-held territory, challenging Pathet Lao control and organizing civilian resistance.<sup>[[3]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/6_UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf)</sup></sup> In 1960 the US began reconnaissance flights to document Pathet Lao's violations.<sup>[[4]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001300050007-2.pdf)</sup></sup> These terminated in 1962 after a new Agreement was reached.
  
  Two crises drew the United States deeper into Laos’s internal affairs. The first occurred on April 10 when a rightist faction of the Government of National Union again attempted a coup to replace Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma. American officials acted quickly to restore things as they were. The second crisis derived from the first. Taking advantage of the political disarray in Vientiane, the Pathet Lao in mid-May stepped up military operations against neutralist Kong Le’s forces and shortly captured the Plain of Jars. In Washington, State and Defense officials now believed the upsurge in communist activity warranted an additional response. The Laos government had requested the recon missions to assist the International Control Commission in documenting Pathet Lao violations of the 1962 Geneva agreements. In Jun 1964, a US Navy reconnaissance aircraft was shot down, in response, President Johnson, with Prime Minister Souvanna’s approval, quickly ordered fighter escorts for the reconnaissance aircraft with pilots henceforth authorized to return enemy fire. Continued violations by Communist North Vietnam would further escalate the US response up until 1973 via bombing campaigns to target Viet Cong under strict ROE to limit civilian casualties<sup>[[5]](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/27/2001329814/-1/-1/0/AFD-100927-078.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/06/2001329752/-1/-1/0/AFD-101006-027.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://archive.org/details/cambodia-laos-review)</sup></sup>
  
  In the early 1970s, allegations of CIA's complicity in illegal drug trafficking in Laos (and the broader Golden Triangle). One such popular perpetrator of this lie was Alfred W. McCoy's 'The politics of heroin in Southeast Asia'. However, this book, and media claims of this were far from the facts of reality. CIA Headquarters and Stations in Asia actively pressured the resistance groups they aided from engaging in such activities, such as driving the Yao chieftain Chao out of the business; the Agency also made sure no US assets would be used for illegal smuggling. CIA's sensitivities to the illegal activity was so great, that one "acting chief of security once proposed a sting operation, with narcotics on an Air America plane going to Saigon used to lure traffickers there into a trap. Devlin imagined the press hysteria that would result if word got out about drugs moving on the CIA's airline, and he rejected the idea on the spot." Other details of CIA efforts to counter the narcotics smuggling can be found in the declassified study, 'Undercover Armies, CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos'. Indeed, early on, a handful of civilian pilots were involved in a shipment of drugs—however, were discovered by CIA personnel. Because of this, Air America strengthened SOPs, and checks. Because of this, even Air America personnel busted two Royal Lao Air force personnel were caught smuggling 120 pounds in 1971.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/6_UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf#page=541)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP73B00296R000300060032-8.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- In the summer of 1950 in South Korea, South Korea engaged in a massacre. British and US Governments tried to prevent it, and managed to save a large number of civilians. United States official documents show that John J. Muccio, then United States Ambassador to South Korea, made recommendations to South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo that the executions be stopped. Great Britain raised this issue with the U.S. at a diplomatic level, causing Dean Rusk, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, to inform the British that U.S. commanders were doing "everything they can to curb such atrocities". During the massacre, the British protected their allies and saved some citizens.

- The US involvement in Vietnam is one of nuance and slow buildup. In 1955, the US reached a formal advisory role to South Vietnam. In 1959, two US Military advisors were killed in a terror attack at Bien Hoa. The advisory role and eventual military training assistance by 1961, were all brought about by the increased North Vietnam attacks of aggression. Indeed, the first POW of the war, George Fryett, was kidnapped for the crime of riding his bicycle on the outskirts of Saigon. By 1962, due to the ongoing attacks by the North communist regime—in direct violation of both international law, the SEATO Treaty and the Geneva Accords of 1954—South Vietnam asks the United States for assistance in self-defense, which leads to an increase in US assistance. The full conflict begins in 1964. So begins the military operations until 1975.<sup>[[1]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Military-Assistance-Advisory-Group-Indochina-is-Re-Designated-MAAG-Vietnam/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Two-U-S-Military-Advisers-Are-Killed-At-Bien-Hoa/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Civilian-Irregular-Defense-Groups-Formally-Established/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/First-U-S-POW-In-Vietnam/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://dsc.duq.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1330&context=dlr)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400885909-017/html?lang=en) </sup></sup> <sup>[[7]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/794921?origin=crossref)</sup></sup> <sup>[[8]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-legal-materials/article/abs/legal-memorandum-on-us-action-in-vietnam/756631751CE81CBF218B31528720DB82)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/lawfulness-of-military-assistance-to-the-republic-of-vietnam/CE962350F9CC548F3D5E64F179B2EAD6)</sup></sup>

  Many groundbreaking, authoritative monographs of US activities, attitudes and policy decisions towards Asia have been written, and provide the most detailed, in-depth examination of several decades:
  - US Intelligence and Vietnam provides a detailed examination of finished intelligence relating to the Vietnam conflict from the time of introduction of US combat forces in 1965 through the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975. In settling on the scope of the study, it was decided to go back to the beginning of the American involvement in Indochina toward the end of World War II and cover at least the major developments that occurred during a period of approximately three decades. 1945-1975.<sup>[[10]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123192047/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001433692.pdf)</sup></sup>
  - CIA and the House of Ngo notes how the CIA aided in establishing a civilian government in South Vietnam. As Diem became more authoritarian and suppressive of minorities, the US tried to persuade him to abide by human rights, however, upon this failing, encouraged but was not involved in, the coup by the military. Ahern traces CIA efforts to bring stability and democracy to South Vietnam and to influence Diem. Although not uncritical of US policy and CIA operations, Ahern's study reveals a CIA Station-indeed in the early years, two Stations-working diligently and effectively to aid Diem in forming a viable state.<sup>[[11]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/2_CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf)</sup></sup>

  - CIA and Rural pacification details CIA's efforts to win the "hearts and minds" of the South Vietnamese rural population. It's a compelling account of CIA's contributions to the US effort to establish and preserve an independent nation in South Vietnam. Despite local success, the CIA effort was, in the end, part of a major tragedy. No one, either in Washington or in the field, grasped the immense complexity and difficulty in instituting a massive effort to control the contryside, win the support of the peasantry, and promote political reforms, while fighting a determined and entrenched enemy.<sup>[[13]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/3_CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf)</sup></sup>

  It has been alleged that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a US false flag to justify the Vietnam war, and that it's admitted in the declassified record. This is a well-debunked myth. The list cites a wiki entry, which cites to a declassified NSA document as evidence. However, problems arise when one actually reads the document in question. 1) It's an opinion piece in NSA's Cryptologic Quarterly. 2) The author in the study actually cautions against a conspiracy theory take, "This mishandling of SIGINT was not done in a manner that can be construde as conspiratorial , that is, with manufactured evidence and collusion at all levels. Rather, the objective of these individuals was to support the Navy's claim that the Desoto patrol had been deliberately attacked by the North Vietnamese." It's worth noting as well, that the NSA, while appreciative of the study, disagrees with the author's central premise: That SIGINT/COMINT was mishandled. According to the response, "This article does dispute Mr. Hanyok's assertion that SIGINT was mishandled, deliberately skewed or not provided to the Johnson administration. In fact, the record shows that NSA performed magnificently during this period of crisis, providing all SIGINT available in a timely manner to a broad spectrum of customers. With only a few trained Vietnamese linguists at NSA Headquarters and field stations analyzing encrypted North Vietnamese communications, NSA still provided U.S. forces advance warning of possible intended attacks that quite likely prevented the sinking of a U.S. destroyer on 2 August.

  Further evidence refuting the claim that COMINT information was presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964 can be found in the NSA review of Secretary McNamara's testimony before Congress. NSA noted that McNamara systematically used overkill language with COMINT and that the COMINT surrounding Tonkin was "flexible for interpretation". Again in 1972, as noted by Mr. Hanyok, NSA Deputy Director Dr. Tordella provided Senator Fulbright's staff director Carl Marcy access to all NSA material relating to the Gulf of Tonkin and told Mr. Marcy that the intercept of 4 August could indeed refer to events that occurred on 2 August. These facts make it clear that NSA consistently provided the Administration, as well as Congress, all COMINT information related to the events of 2-4 August. In fact, one NSA manager present during the August 1964 events has stated, "the folks downtown were provided all of the COM INT as they wanted to do their own analysis. They weren't overly interested in what we thought." Some would argue that NSA should have explicitly informed decision makers in formal SIGINT reporting that COMINT showed there was no attack on 4 August. However, the available COMINT could not support such a position. While some analysts did indeed come to such a conclusion, the COMINT itself, as noted by Dr. Tordella, was "flexible for interpretation". In the final analysis, it is clear that not only was SIGINT information _not_ presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964, but that all of the COM INT produced was distributed to CIA, JCS, DIA and other customers and that NSA uncertainties, even of single words, were made known to decision makers."<sup>[[14]](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/gulf-of-tonkin/articles/release-2/rel2_thoughts_intelligence.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1949 into 1954, CIA covertly supported anticommunist, democratic movements made up of students and refugees in their propaganda operations in mainland China, known as the "Third Force". They also supported a paramilitary arm, focused at resisting Soviet/Communist authoritarian military aggression against Korea.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/static/58b7c48bd76884f38902a2891a5a3cea/Covert-Action-in-China.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1946-55, the Huk Rebellion in the Philippines. The list cites the one-sided wiki article to suggest that the rebellion (consisting of peasants and farmers), were brutally oppressed by the US/Filipino Government. The wiki, and the list, rely heavily on the book, 'The Huk Rebellion: A Case Study of Peasant Revolt in the Philippines'. However, upon reading this reference, a few things become apparent, that the rebellion subsided due to various reason:
  1. agrarian reforms were instituted by the Government.
  2. Army minimised its abuses. Improving on its adherence to the rule of law.
  3. The Communist party joining the rebellion, urging for more radical changes than what the peasants  espoused. The wide gap between the Communist leaders and the peasants was never bridged, thus weakening the movement.

  Indeed, the author credits well-documented US efforts to shape this reform, working with the Filipino Government. As noted in a critically-acclaimed history, 'The Hukbalahap Insurrection: A case study of a successful anti-insurgency Operation in the Philippines - 1946–1955', "Graft and corruption ran rampant in government. The Roxas administration seemed to condone it and did nothing to conceal its presence or depth. In a 1948 letter to General Omar Bradley, the Chief of Staff, Major General George F. Moore (Commander, U.S. Army Philippine-Ryukyus Command) reported that Philippine law enforcement and court systems were inadequate, applied arbitrarily, and did not protect the citizen. Rather. he reported they were being used as tools by government officials, wealthy landowners, and businessmen." Magsaysay became a key figure in cleaning house when he took the position of secretary: Removing corruption within the military and providing justice reform across the board. This only became more pronounced when he became President.

  "A prominent factor in the successful anti-guerrilla campaign was the close, personal relationship that developed between Edward Lansdale and Ramon Magsaysay. This relationship provided an effective conduit through which American advice affected Philippine actions during this period. To overlook Lansdale's role would be to neglect a significant chapter of this story. Lansdale was given exceptional freedom of action and quickly became Hegsaysey's de facto personal advisor. Often the two talked long into the night about conditions that fostered the insurrection and about the real need for governmental and social reforms. Shortly thereafter. Magsaysay took steps to revitalize the military, improve pay and morale, eliminate corrupt officers, and foster his campaign to win the people back to the central government. The people saw clear evidence of military professionalism, competence, and honesty (quite a dramatic change) and through the military's behavior. began to realize that Magsaysay was working for their benefit. To what did Edward Lansdale credit his success? First and foremost, he dealt with Magsaysay and the Filipinos as friends and equals. Filipinos viewed friendship as a deeper and longer-lived relationship than Americans did. To them, friendship involved total acceptance into their their most valued social institution—the family. Trusting the Filipinos, allowing them to form their own solutions to their problems with a minimum of interference, and always treating them as equals were Lansdale's keys to success. He advised them on counter-guerrilla tactics and helped them lessen their reliance on conventional operations, but he always made sure they were responsible for the decisions. He maintained a low-profile and allowed Filipinos to take credit for successful operations, concurrently building pride and confidence in the AFP and their fellow countrymen. As retired Maj. Gen. Lansdale so aptly put it. the Filipinos best knew the problems, best knew how to solve them, and did it—with U.S. aid and advice, but without U.S. domination of their effort."<sup>[[1]](https://history.army.mil/html/books/093/93-8/CMH_Pub_93-8-1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2801097)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/ArtOfWar_AmericaAndThePhilippines.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Some historical revisionists refer to a conspiracy theorist blogger, who made waves in the alternative-truth circles, that he obtained a document confirming the US granted immunity to Ashii, and others of unit 731. However, it quotes a section of a May 5, 1982 report from Norman M. Covert. This quoted section only states that the Joint State, War, Navy Coordinating Committee expressed its desire that the information be retained in US hands exclusively and certainly it should be kept from the Soviet Union. The second driving force... was the precondition established by the War Crimes Tribunal in Japan that no prosecutions would be pursued unless a specific incident could be identified and a single person established as the responsible party. This could not be done in LTG Ishii's case. It could not be said that LTG Ishii personally ordered the death of prisoners through experimentation on a particular date using particular agents. This was the result of the US withdrawal from Manchuria and the lack of incriminating evidence from the wealth of material supplied on testing at the Unit."

  Indeed, many historians have upheld this fact: Army historian Edward J. Drea of the Army Center of Military History, “It came down to the problem that prosecutors didn’t have enough evidence for an indictment." Valerie J. Cranmer, "Conscious of the fact they were establishing international criminal precedent, the United States’ case against the Nazi doctors relied on military chain of command to prove strong legal responsibility for human experimentation crimes. In contrast, the United States avoided prosecuting Unit 731 because they could not replicate the same clear legal framework used to successfully prosecute the Nazis." And IWG historians, "the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) thought it lacked definitive evidence to prosecute Ishii and his group at the War Crimes Tribunal." Lawrence Fouraker, on discredited author, Harris, "In general, Harris tends to consider quantity a substitute for quality, as if the sheer volume of footnoted material can compensate for vagueness or even internal contradictions of those sources. This tendency is especially pronounced in the evidence for the "American cover-up."<sup>[[1]](https://networks.h-net.org/node/20904/reviews/21143/fouraker-harris-factories-death-japanese-biological-warfare-1932-1945)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://brill.com/view/journals/jaer/30/1/article-p32_003.xml?language=en)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/reports/final-report-2007.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/japanese-war-crimes/introductory-essays.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- US Fire bombings in Germany and Japan, as well as the use of nuclear weapons fell well within international law at the time As one of the world's leading experts notes, "President Truman’s classification of the bombing as a purely military objective has caused  some  historians to speculate that the President  engaged in “self-deception.”4  Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate. Although Hiroshima was not a military  base as understood today, it was  a “military city”  as it housed the 2d Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan. The city was also a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops...  Nagasaki’s  military  industry  made it significant. The  atomic  bomb  landed between  the two principal targets in the city: the Mitsubishi Steel and Arm Works and  the  Mitsubishi-Uramaki  Ordnance  Works (Torpedo  Works). The atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lawful under the laws of war existing in 1945. These attacks also represent the only two instances  of  atomic  weapon  strikes in  history. They illustrate the definitional confusion existing with respect  to  the  U.S. classification  of lawful military  objects exclusive of civilian  objects. If some  historians  believe President Truman  was  engaged in “self-deception” in labelling Hiroshima a military target, those historians may be equally perplexed by modern American usage of law-of-war target labels. Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate."<sup>[[1]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2924907)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/3567438/Bennett.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.raf.mod.uk/what-we-do/centre-for-air-and-space-power-studies/documents1/air-power-review-vol-13-no-3/)</sup></sup> Further, counter to some historical revisionists, no, the "two nuclear weapons that the United States exploded over Japan ending World War II are not listed [as tests].

- Between October/November 1901, during the Philippine–American War in the battle of Samar (Battle of Balangiga), General Jacob H. Smith is famously quoted as ordering, “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill and burn the better you will please me... The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness.” When asked by Major Waller asked about the age of those to whom he should apply this guidance, Smith replied that males over ten years old should be considered as being capable of bearing arms. This is cited as evidence that Smith ordered unlawful killings and atrocities against the villagers. This narrative, however, ignores some key facts: When court-martialed for their actions on Samar. Waller would testify that rather than taking the order literally, his interpretation of Smith’s intemperate guidance was, “that the General wanted all insurrectionists killed... people who were bearing arms against Americans... I understood that we were not to  take prisoners if they were armed.” In fact, Waller testified that he cautioned his officers that “we were not sent here to make war on women and children and old men." While smith was seen as ruthless and excessively forceful, "... a circular he issued on 18 November 1901 specifically sought to ensure that accommodating natives were cared for: “Emphasis is laid upon the point that the brigade commander desires not only to permit proper food supplies to reach all friendly natives,  but he particularly desires that these supplies do so reach them." Besides this, Smith was "not tried for issuing illegal orders or for inciting war crimes. Instead, he was charged with 'conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline' for the excessive nature of his orders. A military court headed by Maj. Gen. Loyd Wheaton, who had commanded the Department of North Philippines, that convened in Manila in April 1902 found General Smith guilty of instructing  Waller to “kill and burn” as  much as possible and not take any prisoners. Commenting on this verdict three months later, Secretary of War Elihu Root described the  language Smith was convicted of using as containing “intemperate, inconsiderate, and violent expressions, which, if accepted literally, would grossly violate the humane rules governing American armies in the field.” But the court exercised leniency and sentenced Smith merely to be 'admonished by the reviewing authority.' It  justified this outcome by concluding that Smith “did not mean everything that his unexplained language implied; that his subordinates did not gather such a meaning;  and that the orders were never executed in such sense.” Root commented, “Fortunately they [Smith’s instructions] were not taken literally and were not followed. No  women or children or helpless persons or noncombatants or prisoners were put to death in pursuance of them." Smith was still forced out of the Military for his actions. Others were also convicted and served life in prison for unlawful acts unrelated to Smith.<sup>[[1]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26296824?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents)</sup></sup>

## USA/Domestic matters
- On Feb 10, 2022, Senator Wyden once again made headlines with his lies distorting details of a CIA program during his reelection run. He alleged, per a letter that was approved for declassification that he wrote, that the CIA operates a program that collects, in bulk, US Person data, akin to the discontinued BMD program 215 of the PA. It should be noted that declassification isn't an accuracy review, nor endorse the content. With the letter, the CIA also declassified a PCLOB report on the program, though heavily redacted. However, Senator Wyden counted on the media not reading this document, as it makes clear: 1) The program targeted financial records belonging to ISIS: " This report examines the CIA’s financial data activities conducted under E.O. 12333 in support of counterterrorism efforts with respect to the network of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL." 2) That the program didn't intentionally collect USP data, that unintentional collection must be avoided as much as possible: "officials also emphasized that targeters try to limit the amount of information about USPs that is collected. [redacted] examples of such limits focus on avoiding information that is clearly identifiable as US-focused. For example, [redacted] stated that CIA operators would try to avoid collection information [redacted] believed to have a connection to the US. Similarly, [redacted] CIA operators would try to avoid [redacted] asserts that it follows routine steps to limit USP data." 3) CIA has an effective means to mask and delete USP data: "The CIA OIG reviewed the filters used [redacted] and related procedures and concluded that they are 'effective in identifying USP information in bulk financial data'... OIG described a separate process by which the CIA’s [redacted] takes steps to “minimize,” i.e., delete, segregate, or mask USP information in certain collections before the data is transferred... OIG conclude that the procedures “were effective in ensuring that only minimized bulk financial data are disseminated." The Senator also lied about not being briefed. His committee was, as unclassified documents confirm.<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/static/63f697addbbd30a4d64432ff28bbc6d6/OPCL-PCLOB-Report-on-CIA-Activities.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On 10 August, 2019 Jeffrey Epstein took his own life. Counter to the many conspiracy theory memes, this was confirmed to be a suicide by two independent autopsies, as well as confirmed by a surveillance camera that showed no one entered the tier in which Epstein was housed.<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1218466/download#page=9)</sup></sup> An independent DOJ investigation utterly destroyed the conspiracy theories about the camera system, etc. Per a 2019 indictment, states, "As confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC's internal video surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only entrance to the tier in which Epstein was housed until approximately 6.30am on August 10." The DOJ IG report concludes, "Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed." The report goes on in detail: "In August 2019, the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had approximately 150 video security cameras (no audio) placed throughout the institution. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that approximately 11 cameras were located in and around the Special Housing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August 10, 2019, including one at the end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that showed any movement in or out of inmate cells and in the Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live video feeds. Following Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigators attempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the security cameras were working and transmitting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the SHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29, 2019, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier.

  As a result, while the L Tier video camera was transmitting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2019, and morning of August 10, 2019, the video was not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and 10 was a camera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of the common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to the different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or attempting to enter the L Tier from the common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and 10, would have been picked up by the video recorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings showed the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU staff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier. All video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR 1” and “DVR 2,” and each consisted of 16 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York’s security cameras were assigned to record to DVR 1, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras assigned to DVR 1 only recorded to the DVR 1 hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to the DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be retrieved from DVR 1, and vice versa. The OIG’s investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2019, the Electronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2016, he found that the facility’s security camera system needed to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly maintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be replaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system was subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.

  The Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2018, told the OIG he was generally aware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further stated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be fixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system. Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2018, the Warden submitted a memorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $800,000 in funding to replace the entire camera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December 1, 2018, and an estimated completion date of February 9, 2019. The BOP approved the funding request, and on September 21, 2018, a contract in the amount of $698,108.99 was awarded to Company 1 to provide various equipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2018, a separate contract in the amount of $34,089.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to install the camera system. As the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough qualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the facility, so beginning the week of March 17, 2019, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to perform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC New York’s custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills required to do the camera work.

  At the time of Epstein’s death on August 10, 2019, the camera system upgrade had not been completed. Immediately following Epstein’s death, Company 1 officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new recording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing cameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2019, and they were installed in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of August 2021, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.
  
  The available video showed that at approximately 7:49 p.m. on August 9, Epstein was escorted toward the L Tier stairway by an individual believed to be the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge.54 At approximately 10:39 p.m., an unidentified CO appeared to walk up the L Tier stairway, and then reappeared within view of the camera at 10:41 p.m. This is believed to be the last time anyone entered L Tier before approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. Between approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9 and just before 6:30 a.m. on August 10, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video any CO or other individual enter any of the SHU tiers, which is consistent with CO Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas’s admissions to the OIG that the SHU rounds and counts were not conducted during that time frame. At approximately 6:28 a.m., an unidentified officer was observed on the L Tier stairway, presumably to deliver breakfast food trays. Between 6:28 a.m. and 6:32 a.m., an unidentified officer, believed to be Noel, moved back and forth several times between the L Tier stairway and the SHU Officers’ Station. At approximately 6:33 a.m., additional officers entered the SHU and ascended the L Tier stairway, presumably after Noel activated her body alarm when Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell.

  As noted above, the camera at the end of the L Tier was providing a live video feed at the time of Epstein’s death but the video was not being recorded. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that certain MCC New York personnel, including the Control Center, SIS personnel, the Warden, most Lieutenants, and the Electronics Technician, had access to the live video feed of the institution’s security cameras. He explained that to view the live feed of a particular camera an employee with access would need to key in the specific camera into the security camera system to call up the live feed. The Correctional Systems Officer, who was working in the Control Center on August 10 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant both told the OIG that the only live feed from the SHU on their screens was video from the camera showing the SHU common area, and they did not perceive a need to take the necessary steps to see the live feed from the SHU L Tier from either of their duty stations on the evening Epstein died."<sup>[[2]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/23-085.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2017, Reality Winner was charged and convicted for leaking classified information about Russian hacking operations against US companies for their election operations—despite the Government detailing the Russian efforts months earlier. She claimed she wanted to show the public about Russia's subversive actions, however: The investigation revealed that she joined the Air Force, and later contractors to obtain TS/SCI information in order to deliberately leak classified information. "Winner’s exceptionally damaging disclosure was not a spontaneous, unplanned event, but was the calculated culmination of a series of acts.  She researched whether it was possible to insert a thumb drive into a Top Secret computer without being detected... she researched job opportunities that would provide her access to classified information. At the same time, she searched for information about anti-secrecy organizations, and she celebrated claimed compromises in U.S. classified information." And, "Winner repeatedly expressed contempt for the United States. On February 25, 2017, Winner wrote that she was “gonnafail” her polygraph examination, which would ask if she had “ever plotted against” the government; claimed that she said she “hates America like 3 times a day”; and when asked “But you don’t actually hate America, right?”, responded, “I mean yeah I do it’s literally the worst thing to happen on the planet.”<sup>[[1]](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/5513705/United-States-v-Winner-Government-s-Sentencing.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/statement-us-attorney-bobby-l-christine-regarding-sentencing-reality-winner)</sup></sup>

- In 2016, activists and media pundits decried the building of the Dakota Access pipeline, that crosses 4 states. Myths and disinformation ran wild, so here are the facts: The Dakota Access pipeline is not built on Native American reservations. 99.98% of the pipeline is installed on privately owned property in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. The Dakota Access Pipeline does not enter the Standing Rock Sioux reservation at any point; Eight other pipelines currently run below Lake Oahe. In fact, existing pipelines have safely transported natural gas beneath Lake Oahe for more than 30 years; The Dakota Access Pipeline was approved by regulatory agencies in all four states where the pipeline will operate and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Tribes were consulted hundreds of times while DAPL route was planned. In developing the route, the United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was reviewed. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the Dakota; The Dakota Access Pipeline has not impacted groundwater in any of the four states through which it passes since going into service in June of 2017; The Dakota Access Pipeline does not encroach on water supply; the Standing Rock Sioux's water intake has been moved to a location about 75 miles away from the pipeline; The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation, also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes and located in North Dakota, use the Dakota Access Pipeline to transport more than 60% of the oil they produce; In August of 2018, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed more than a year of additional study of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, saying the work substantiated its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats; Were tribes consulted on the Dakota Access Pipeline? Yes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was under review. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the pipeline route. During the planning phase, Dakota Access worked with the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer and contracted professionally licensed archaeologists to conduct Class II and Class III cultural surveys.<sup>[[1]](https://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/The-Facts.html)</sup></sup> Indeed, as a Court found, "In fact, on this record, it appears that the Corps exceeded its NHPA obligations at many of the PCN sites." The protests cost the state of North Dakota a lot of resources and money. According to local law enforcement, protesters provoked multiple dangerous and criminal confrontations and caused significant damage to property. Additional police were brought in from all over the country to help during the protests. North Dakota's congressional delegation has asked the federal government for $38 million to cover the cost of policing the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Approximately 21 million pounds of trash, debris and waste was ultimately removed from the protest site at Lake Oahe, costing over $1 million in clean up and causing significant concern for the health of the lake. Corps Capt. Ryan Hignight said a total of 8,170 cubic yards of debris was removed from the three camps - Sacred Stone, Oceti Sakowin and Rosebud - all within the flood plain on federally managed land. In 2017, Energy Transfer gifted the state of North Dakota $15 million to help cover costs.<sup>[[2]](https://mwalliancenow.org/news/memorandum-opinion-judge-standing-rock-sioux-tribe-v-us-army-corps-engineers/)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists allege that the FBI "created" a terrorist, by the name of Sami Osmakac. However, in 2017, a Federal Court of Appeals smacked down this hoax, "We recognize Osmakac argues that, since he raised a serious entrapment issue, the strength-of-the-evidence factor weighs in favor of a finding of prejudice. But the government’s thorough detailing of the evidence shows that there was substantial evidence of Osmakac’s guilt, including substantial evidence of his propensity to commit a crime of this nature well before he met the CS in 40 September 2011. Osmakac provides nothing to contradict the trial record, which showed that he, not the undercover agent, initiated and greatly escalated the planned terrorist attack by asking for weapons of mass destruction."<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/d9/press-releases/attachments/2017/08/21/20170818_osmakac_opinion_0.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The Curtis Culwell Center attack was a failed terrorist attack on an exhibit featuring cartoon images of Muhammad at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015. Political pundits have claimed that undercover FBI agent encouraged Elton Simpson to commit the attacks. However, as in all cases of this nature, the FBI didn't initiate the plans or desire. Indeed, Simpson et al had evidence of terrorism links dating back to the mid 2000s. Conspiracy theorists try to quote-mine the text, "tear up Texas" as evidence of FBI "goading". However, in context, Simpson was already of this mindset by stating, "that goes without saying." The Courts have ruled, that FBI's activities here were proper, abiding by the Constitution, laws, and various governing regulations. <sup>[[1]](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.293751/gov.uscourts.txnd.293751.28.0_1.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Contrary to conspiracy theorist reporting, Eric McDavid was not "entrapped" by the FBI. Federal Courts and a Grand Jury threw out this nonsensical claim. There is some complexity in the case from 2015, and his release—so I'll quote extensively from the Court record to correct the myths: "McDavid and two co-defendants were charged with conspiring, between June 2005 and January 13, 2006, to destroy by fire or explosives one or more targets in the Sacramento area, including the United States Forest Service Institute of Forest Genetics, the Nimbus Dam, and local cellular telephone towers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(n). McDavid’s two co-defendants pled guilty, cooperated with the United States, and testified against McDavid at trial. After a 10-day trial, the jury rejected McDavid’s entrapment defense and convicted McDavid of the crimes charged in the Indictment. The Court sentenced McDavid to 235 months in custody, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed McDavid’s conviction and sentence. United States v. McDavid, 396 Fed. Appx. 365 (9th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S.Ct. 2469 (May 16, 2011)." After his conviction and appeal loss—he filed a FOIA request.

  May 15, 2012, McDavid filed that the Government, among other things, failed "to disclose during discovery in the underlying criminal prosecution all favorable evidence material to guilt or punishment, as required under Bady v. Maryland. On or about November 6, 2014, the United States disclosed to McDavid approximately eleven documents comprised of correspondence between McDavid and a government informant who testified at McDavid’s trial, which were not disclosed during the criminal proceedings that preceded his § 2255 action (the “First Disclosure”). The correspondence delivered by the government to McDavid in the First Disclosure was not produced pursuant to McDavid’s post-convictions FOIA requests." On or about December 12, 2014, the United States disclosed to McDavid un-redacted copies of the Miami Reports (the “Second Disclosure”). Later in December 2014, the United States voluntarily agreed to disclose to McDavid un-redacted copies of certain of the remaining FOIA Documents but only after a review of those documents for sensitive information that required redaction (the “Proposed Third Disclosure”). As with the documents in the Second Disclosure, the United States had already specifically addressed the documents in the Proposed Third Disclosure in its written opposition to McDavid’s § 2255 petition, in the Walker Declaration. The United States argued that all of the FOIA Documents were either properly withheld in discovery or, alternatively, were not exculpatory or material under Brady. On or about December 15, 2014, the parties appeared before Judge Brennan and presented the outline of a proposed settlement of McDavid’s § 2255 claims.

  Beginning at least as early as November 2014, the parties acknowledged their disagreements about the merits of McDavid’s arguments but engaged in negotiations toward a comprehensive and final settlement of his claims. The United States took the position that McDavid’s § 2255 claims, including his Brady claims relating to all of the FOIA Documents, were without merit. However, the United States took a different position with respect to the eleven documents of correspondence between McDavid and the informant, which it produced in the First Disclosure. With respect to those eleven documents only, the United States concluded that this Court or a reviewing court might find its inadvertent failure to disclose those eleven documents was sufficient to justify relief under Brady. McDavid agreed. Therefore, to avoid the expense and risks of further litigation, to advance the interests of justice, and to conclude McDavid’s § 2255 action and the underlying prosecution in every respect, the parties jointly agreed to enter into a Final Settlement Agreement compromising and settling McDavid’s disputed § 2255 claims.

  After a hearing on January 8, 2015 (the “January Hearing”), the Court accepted the parties’ stipulations and agreed to enter the relief described in the Final Settlement Agreement. See Reporters Transcript of January 8, 2015 Hearing at 1-42, attached hereto as Government’s Exhibit 2 (“Govt. Ex. 2”). Specifically, the Court: (i) accepted McDavid’s waiver of indictment and plea of guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to a Superseding Information that charged him with conspiracy to destroy by fire or explosives one or more targets in the Sacramento area, contrary to 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(f) and (i), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3714; (ii) held an immediate sentencing hearing, relied on the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report filed by the United States Probation Office for the Eastern District of California on February 21, 2008, and sentenced McDavid to time already served in custody and a two-year period of Supervised Release; (iii) granted McDavid’s motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to the extent stipulated by the parties in the Final Settlement Agreement, and vacated McDavid’s conviction and sentence as finalized by the Judgment and Commitment entered by the Court on May 19, 2008, in the underlying criminal prosecution. Thereafter, the Court ordered the relief recommended by the parties in the Final Settlement Agreement and filed that Agreement. After the hearing, the Court executed and filed a new Judgment and Commitment memorializing McDavid’s new conviction and sentence, and McDavid was released from custody. McDavid served approximately 108 months in custody."

  Eric subsequently requested the Court, an Order to Show Cause. However, the Court shut this down in the final ruling on the matter: "Moreover, this Court exercised its inherent power to ask the Government 'how and why' documents were withheld when it thoroughly and painstakingly questioned the United States at the January 8, 2015, hearing regarding the very issues Defendant’s current counsel raises now. The Court is satisfied that the failure to turn over documents in this case was inadvertent, an anomaly, and an incident not likely to be repeated. No further action by this Court is required."<sup>[[1]](https://edca.typepad.com/files/govt-opp-d-mo-osc-8-20-15-emd.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://edca.typepad.com/files/exs-govt-opp-d-mo-osc-8-20-15-emd.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://edca.typepad.com/files/order-denying-mo-osc-9-2-15-emd.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2015, conspiracy theorists claim that the Chicago Homan Square facility is a "domestic blacksite". This, of course, is nonsense. It never was a secret facility, and people detained their for various crimes can be seen by their own lawyers, or issued a government lawyer, a long established practice the free, Western world. Homan Square is home to CPD’s Evidence and Recovered Property Section, which is open to the public. Homan Square is the only CPD facility where members of the public can collect evidence recovered during a now complete criminal investigation, or found property. Portions of the facility are sensitive. Homan Square is the base of operations for officers working undercover assignments. These men and women dress in plain clothes and work to disrupt gang activity and clear drug markets out of neighborhoods. Advertising their base of operations could put their lives at risk, which is why Homan Square features little signage. Other sensitive units housed at the facility include the Bureau of Organized Crime (including the narcotics unit), the SWAT Unit, Evidence Technicians, and the CPD ballistics lab. Fake allegations claim there is police beatings, and room-controlled temp to force admissions, however, there is no such thing at the facility. Everything about the facility is standard in terms of procedure.<sup>[[1]](https://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/Homan-Fact-Sheet.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Disgraced journalist, Sharyl Attkisson, claimed in 2013 that the Obama administration was spying on her, due to her reporting on Fast and Furious and Benghazi. She hired a technician to review her computer, who conclude there was an advanced actor who gained remote access. However, an independent, expert forensic examination revealed serious flaws in their work. Ultimately concluded no such action occurred.

- In 2013, a Federal Appeals Court upheld the conviction on James Cromitie, a man who desired to strike terror on American soil. He claimed his convictions were invalid because he was entrapped by the FBI and that the FBI engaged in outrageous conduct. However, the 2013 ruling determined neither to have been the case. James was the first to raise the idea of bombing synagogues. "as with all sting operations, government creation of the opportunity to commit an offense, even to the point of supplying defendants with materials essential to commit crimes, does not exceed due process limits. Once the FBI learned that Cromitie, in his very first encounter with Hussain, had expressed a desire to 'do something to America' and had given an ominous meaning to this statement by saying he wanted to die like a martyr, the FBI agents would have been derelict in their duties if they did not test how far Cromitie would go to carry out his desires. Determining whether Cromitie would go so far as to launch missiles at military aircraft was not outrageous government conduct."<sup>[[1]](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-cromitie)</sup></sup>

- Conservatives, since 2013 have repeated the lie that right-wing organisations were unfairly targeted by the IRS, under Obama's order.

- Conspiracy theorists claim that under the 2012 NDAA, US citizens can be indefinitely detained by the Military, for no reason. However, reading the 2012 NDAA, we find this isn't so. All it did was codify the 2001 AUMF. It should be noted that NDAAs change, but come around every year. Further, not a single example exists to show this has been misused.

- In 2012, sensationalist reporting from the WSJ claimed that the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), as a result of changes in March of that year to AG guidelines, allowed NCTC access to data from other agencies, on any and all Americans, for no reason. The headlines that followed, as well as the original WSJ piece, distort reality—either by gross incompetence or a deliberate. The 2008 Guidelines established three “tracks” for NCTC to access or acquire such information from other federal agencies. Under Track 1, NCTC analysts would have account-based access to a relevant agency dataset, while under Track 2, NCTC would submit query terms for the providing agency to perform the search and return responsive information. Under Track 3, the agency dataset would be replicated (copied) at NCTC so NCTC could use its analytic tools to identify terrorism information; if NCTC could not “promptly” identify terrorism information in the replicated dataset, the 2008 Guidelines required NCTC to “promptly remove” the information. As implemented at NCTC, this generally required the removal of information within 180 days.

  In March, 2012, the DNI, the Attorney General, and the Director of NCTC approved the updated NCTC Guidelines. The Guidelines now provide that datasets likely to contain significant terrorism information may be temporarily retained for up to 5 years (or a shorter period as determined with the providing agency, known as the "data provider"). The updated Guidelines carry forward the same three-track framework from the 2008 Guidelines, while adding specificity on how data is obtained, retained, and disseminated, and providing for enhanced safeguards and oversight mechanisms to protect important privacy and civil liberties interests throughout the information sharing lifecycle. These 3 tracks only relate to the following 3 types of data already in the lawful and Constitutional possession of the Government: International travel, immigration status records and financial related, where banks may submit what they believe to be suspect financial transactions. 
  
  The Guidelines only apply to datasets that are reasonably believed to contain terrorism information. Moreover, NCTC may only retain United States person information (and other information protected under the Guidelines) within such datasets beyond the temporary retention period if it is reasonably believed to constitute terrorism information. 
  
  For Tracks 1 and 2, NCTC’s initial query term must itself be an item of terrorism information. For Track 3, NCTC’s queries must be designed solely to identify terrorism information and to minimize the review of information protected under the Guidelines that is not terrorism information. In addition, NCTC must limit access to duly trained and authorized personnel, implement compliance verification measures, and determine whether to apply enhanced safeguards (e.g., more data access/use restrictions). For all tracks, information protected under the Guidelines may be shared only under limited circumstances. Independent audits have confirmed NCTC abides by these restrictions.<sup>[[1]](https://sgp.fas.org/othergov/intel/nctc_guidelines.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/NCTC_White_Paper-Overview_of_NCTC_Data_Accesses_under_its_2012_AG_Guidelines_as_of_March_2014.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[3]](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/NCTCWhitePaperOverviewofNCTC2012AGGBaselineSafeguards050114.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/CLPO_Information_Paper_on_NCTC_AG_Guidelines012213.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/TAB_3_2013-2015_NCTC_AGG_Annual_Report_Redacted.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- An independent 2010 Intelligence Community Review Panel examined the Fort Hood shooting and Flight 253 incidents, among its findings, it found, "Officers in various agencies expressed everything from unease to worry about inadvertent mistakes to fear of professional rebuke if they strayed outside existing guidelines. In many cases, the panel sensed that officers had the authority they needed but were erring on the side of caution—a subtle form of risk aversion... these tendencies had practical and worrisome consequences in the two cases we studied." and, "Throughout our interviews, we were impressed with the great care taken by the Community to protect information about US Persons.... Intelligence officers in both the 25 December and the Hasan cases worked hard to stay within the  guidelines, which sometimes led to excessive caution."<sup>[[1]](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/FOIA/Report_to_the_Director_of_National_Intelligence_on_the_Fort_Hood_and_Northwest_Flight_253_Incidents_U.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In an April 2008 a NYT article it was alleged that the DoD used retired military analyst (RMAs) to generate favorable news coverage of the administration’s wartime performance, and that it gave those analysts who had ties to military contractors an unfair opportunity to enhance their business interests. Two investigations were launched in repose to this article, plus a GAO opinion. The GAO opinion finds, "We found no evidence that DOD attempted to conceal from the public its outreach to RMOs or its role in providing RMOs with information, materials, access to department officials, travel, and luncheons. Moreover, we found no evidence that DOD contracted with or paid RMOs for positive commentary or analysis. Consequently, DOD’s public affairs activities involving RMOs, in our opinion, did not violate the publicity or propaganda prohibition."<sup>[[1]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-316443.pdf)</sup></sup> Of the two IG investigations, the first concluded, "we found the evidence insufficient to conclude that RMA outreach activities were improper. Further, we found insufficient basis to conclude that OASD(PA) conceived of or undertook a disciplined effort to assemble a contingent of influential RMAs who could be depended on to comment favorably on DoD programs. With regard to RMAs who had ties to military contractors, extensive searches found no instance where such RMAs used information or contacts obtained as a result of the OASD(PA) outreach program to achieve a competitive advantage for their company. Of the 70 RMAs that we examined, we found that 20 (29 percent) had some type of corporate association. We examined publicly available contracting information involving RMA-affiliated companies to identify any pattern of contract award or contract type that might indicate an irregularity. We did not isolate such a pattern and concluded that further investigative work into this matter was not warranted."<sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20090320221936/http://www.dodig.osd.mil/Inspections/IE/Reports/ExaminationofAllegationsInvolvingDoDOfficeofPublicAffairsOutreachProgram.pdf)</sup></sup>

  The second report found, "The RMA outreach activities were consistent with DOD directives and regulations outlined for the community relations program and the implementation of those activities was not inconsistent with law or regulation. We found the intent of the RMA outreach activities was to provide information to the public through former military members, as credible third party subject matter experts. In implementing the RMA outreach activities, we found that OASD (PA) included a reasonable cross section of media outlets based on our analysis of the in-Pentagon meetings and the travel event."<sup>[[3]](https://web.archive.org/web/20120605001943/http://www.dodig.mil/Ir/reports/RMATheFinalReport112111redacted.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists have been claiming that between 2007 and 2008, there was misconduct, or corruption by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO), in the handling of the Federal investigation into Geffrey Epstein, by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement (NPA). This has become known as the "sweetheart deal." However, a thorough review by DOJ's OPR found no such corruption or misuse. During the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein's attorney, and filed under seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein attorney Lefkowitz and Villafaña (and others with Acosta and Sloman during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized, and thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkowitz's side of the communications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafaña's communications to Lefkowitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over Epstein's objections. Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafaña's emails as proof that Villafaña and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein's attorneys to keep the “sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in particular were cited as evidence of the USAO's  improper favouritism towards Epstein. OPR noted, "Because the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other information showing Villafaña’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a public narrative developed that Villafaña colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that narrative to be inaccurate."<sup>[[1]](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/justice-department-review-jeffrey-epstein/41c1a927e0acff76/full.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists distort what Operation Fast and Furious was, claiming, without evidence, that the US Government was secretly smuggling guns to cartels, or drugs, to Mexico. This however, is just fake news. Op Fast and Furious was an investigation. Nothing more. The background:
  On October 31, 2009, special agents working in the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) received information from a local gun store about the recent purchases of multiple AK- 47 style rifles by four individuals. Agents began investigating the purchases and soon came to believe that the men were so-called “straw purchasers” involved in a large-scale gun trafficking organization responsible for buying guns for transport to violent Mexican drug trafficking organizations. This investigation was later named “Operation Fast and Furious.” By the time ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona (U.S. Attorney’s Office) publicly announced the indictment in the case on January 25, 2011, agents had identified more than 40 subjects believed to be connected to a trafficking conspiracy responsible for purchasing over 2,000 firearms for approximately $1.5 million in cash. During the course of the investigation, ATF agents seized only about 100 of the firearms purchased, the result of a strategy jointly pursued by ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office that deferred taking overt enforcement action against the individual straw purchasers while seeking to build a case against the leaders of the organization. Numerous firearms bought by straw purchasers were later recovered by law enforcement officials at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States. One such recovery occurred in connection with the tragic shooting death of a federal law enforcement agent, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry. On January 16, 2010, one of the straw purchasers, Jaime Avila, purchased three AK-47 style rifles from a Phoenix-area gun store. ATF agents learned about that purchase 3 days later and, consistent with the investigative strategy in the case, made no effort to locate Avila or seize the rifles although ATF had identified Avila as a suspect in November 2009. Two of the three rifles purchased by Avila on January 16 were recovered 11 months later at the scene of the murder of Agent Terry, who was shot and killed on December 14, 2010, as he tried to arrest persons believed to be illegally entering the United States. The day after and in response to Agent Terry’s murder, ATF agents arrested Avila. Several weeks later, on January 19, 2011, the U.S. Attorney’s Office indicted 20 Operation Fast and Furious straw purchasers and gun traffickers. As of August 1, 2012, 14 defendants, including Avila, have entered guilty pleas to one or more counts of the indictment. Although the FBI was assigned to investigate the murder of Agent Terry, the senior leadership of ATF and the Department of Justice (Department or DOJ) took little action in the immediate aftermath of Agent Terry’s death to learn more about an ATF investigation that involved the trafficking of approximately 2,000 weapons over many months, and how guns purchased by a previously-identified subject of that investigation ended up being recovered at the scene of Agent Terry’s murder. Shortly after Agent Terry’s death, stories began appearing on the Internet alleging that ATF had allowed firearms to “walk” to Mexico, and that one of those firearms may have been linked to the death of a federal law enforcement officer.<sup>[[1]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/441887/ig-report-fast-and-furious.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Claims that Bush "suspended" habeas corpus have 0 basis in reality. "The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) further narrowed the scope of habeas relief, providing that prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay may not access the federal courts through habeas corpus; instead, they must go through the military commissions and then seek appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court. However, the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush (2008) expanded the territorial reach of habeas corpus, ruling that the Suspension Clause affirmatively guaranteed the right to habeas review. Thus, alien detainees designated as enemy combatants who were held outside the United States had the constitutional right to habeas corpus."<sup>[[1]](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus)</sup></sup>  Detainees were able to file habeas corpus from their arrival. <sup>[[2]](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/01_David-Kris.pdf)</sup></sup>  
  
- Allegations arose that since 2001, the FBI had been targeting certain domestic advocacy groups such as PETA, Greenpeace, etc. However, an investigation  that examined a 6-year period from Jan 2001 to Dec 2006, found, "the evidence in our review did not indicate that the FBI targeted any of the groups for investigation based on their First Amendment activities."<sup>[[1]](https://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/oig-reports/s1009r.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- Political pundits and sensationalist headlines claimed in 2005, that the Pentagon was spying on Americans for anti-war demonstrations and groups. This sparked two members of Congress to request an independent IG investigation into the matter. This allegations concerns a database called Threat And Local Observation Notice (TALON). TALON was created under the DoD's Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA). The IG investigation however, found that this wasn't any sort of intelligence program. It found that TALON was a reporting system for community tips provided to DoD and law enforcement, on possible threats to DoD facilities. This enabled Commanders to protect their personnel and facilities. Further, "CIFA did not use the information in an attempt to monitor First Amendment activities of U.S. persons."<sup>[[1]](https://media.defense.gov/2007/Jun/27/2001712179/-1/-1/1/07-INTEL-09.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/TALON/20090626_dod_talon_release.pdf)</sup></sup>
    
- Political pundits claim that the Patriot Act was used to wrongfully target and arrest Brandon Mayfield, in May, 2004, in connection to the terrorist attack in Madrid—allegedly because he was a Muslim, that he was racially profiled. However, the independent DOJ Inspector General investigation found that 1. No Patriot Act authority was used, 2. The unique circumstances of Brandon Mayfield's fingerprints closely match those of the bomber, 3. Investigators did not know of his religion until during the investigation. 

  In sum, the OIG concluded "contrary to some public speculation, the Patriot Act amendments to FISA did not affect the government's decision to seek FISA authority in the Mayfield case and did not affect the scope of information the government collected about Mayfield pursuant to the FISA surveillance and searches. We also found that the FBI did not use certain provisions of the Patriot Act in the Mayfield case, such as those relating to delayed notification searches. Moreover, the evidence indicated that, even prior to the Patriot Act, the FBI would likely have sought and been able to obtain identical FISA authorization for the searches and surveillance of Mayfield that it conducted." 

  "The OIG concluded that Mayfield's religion was not the sole or primary cause of the FBI's failure to question the original misidentification and catch its error. The primary factors Were the similarity of the prints and the Laboratory's overconfidence in the superiority of its examiners."<sup>[[1]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/s0601/final.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On May 6, 2002, the US opposed the ICC because it suffers from a number structural flaws. At the same time, the US proposed alternatives that already exist: "Domestic Accountability: Encourage states to create credible justice institutions in their own state rather than abdicating responsibility to an international body. Where domestic legal institutions are lacking, but domestic will is present, the international community must be prepared to assist in creating the capacity for the sovereign state to address the violations. This includes political, financial, legal, and logistical support. Where domestic will is non-existent, the international community can intervene through the UN Security Council, consistent with the UN Charter. Ad hoc international mechanisms may be created under the auspices of the UN Security Council, as was done to establish the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Additionally, hybrid courts consisting of international participants and the affected state’s participants can be authorized, such as in the case of Sierra Leone."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20031129170524/http://www.usembassy.at/en/download/pdf/icc_pa.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Further, Per the ICC, "The International Criminal Court is _not a substitute_ for national courts. According to the Rome Statute, it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. The International Criminal Court _can only intervene where a State is unable or unwilling genuinely to carry out the investigation and prosecute the perpetrators"_<sup>[[2]](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/Publications/understanding-the-icc.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Within the first 100 days of the tragic attack on 9/11, President Bush moved swiftly to protect Muslims from hate crimes and the Department of Justice followed his lead by having their Civil Rights Division sponsor community forums in Chicago, Illinois, and Dearborn, Michigan, on combating ethnically motivated violence as a result of the September 11th terrorist attacks.

- Immediately after 9/11, indeed, within 3 months, law enforcement arrested people connected to the PENTTBOM investigation. In total, 762 aliens were under their violation of Immigration laws. During this time, they were manually reviewed by the FBI and released. While intended to be no more than a few days detained, the average was 80 days. The highest arrests were within the same week of the terror attacks. By December 2001, there was a sharp decline of arrests. Further, the vast majority of detainees held were treated like any other case. However, a few were roughly treated at NY's Brooklyn Metro Detention Center, by a handful of officers. MDC management installed cameras into teach 9/11 detainee's cell, and record all interactions between cells, to make sure they were not abused—or capture evidence if it did occur. <sup>[[1]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/special/0306/full.pdf)</sup></sup>   
  
- Naturally, after 9/11, various States across the country requested requests for Intelligence Community support for counterterrorism investigations. A 2011 AP article alleged improper CIA activities involving NYPD. However, an independent investigation that reviewed thousands of records, many personnel, Congressional briefings, and more—found no violations of law, policy, or EO had occurred.<sup>[[1]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/717864/cia-nypd-ig.pdf)</sup></sup>

### Post-9/11 Surveillance authorities
- Pundits, conspiracy theorists & laypeople have misunderstood & perpetuated many myths on surveillance activities of the FBI & NSA after the terrorist attack on 9/11. Broadly: They claim they're illegal & unconstitutional; the Patriot Act weakened privacy protections, backdoor/reverse searches & collected all data on everyone with no warrants, & that this was proven by Snowden. This is false.<sup>[[1]](https://store.legal.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/Treatises/National-Security-Investigations-and-Prosecutions-3d/p/106604908)</sup></sup>

- Jeffrey Sterling contacted a reporter in early 2003, claiming that the CIA incidentally aided Iran's nuclear weapons development in a covert program. The NYT declined to run the story because of concerns for the safety of human sources. Sterling had a personal axe to grind against the CIA, as he alleged that he was racially discriminated against by colleagues. However, an independent investigation found this allegation baseless. He took this issue to court, but backed off when the Court said it would require CIPA to review classified information—he clearly knew he didn't have a case. As for the core operation itself: A Russian scientist had been an asset for the CIA since 1994—by 1998, the CIA began plans to deceive Iran's nuclear program via the following: Merlin provided designs on Soviet nuclear weapon parts such as the fire set. From there, CIA examined the design and altered many components to cause total failure. The goal was to delay Iran's covert WMD program. The design plans were then prototyped and tested by two independent teams unaware of the modifications. The team's collective experience totalled more than 200 years. They then tried to fix the mechanism if they discovered any flaws. Tests were all successful. In 2000, Merlin traveled to Vienna and met with Iranian contacts. The rest of the operation is all classified.<sup>[[1]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/govt-exh-399.pdf)</sup></sup> Sterling was last involved in the program in May 2000 and in Jan of 2002, Sterling was fired from the Agency. His allegations that this operation backfired are without merit, as it would be impossible for him to know. In 2006, the journalist he approached, wrote a book, publishing these activities. Merlin and his wife were so concerned that Russia or Iran could discover their identities, and capturing them for torture and kill them, the wife would jump in fear at every little noise at night.<sup>[[2]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/govt-exh-406.pdf#page=32)</sup></sup> Thankfully, Sterling lost the appeal and spent years in prison for this serious breach of ethics and obstruction of justice. <sup>[[3]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/062217-appeal.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Over the years, it has been alleged by conspiracy theorists that the CIA has misled Congress on various matters. One such cited example is the case of Richard Barlow, a Foreign Affairs Specialist while at DoD. In 1993, a Congressionally-mandated Joint Inspectors General investigation between CIA, DoD and State, found that 1. He had made no such disclosure to Congress, but said Congress was misled to a coworker. 2 He was not terminated from his position for allegedly making a disclosure to Congress, suffering reprisal—that the decision for employment termination was made well before the alleged disclosure took place. 3. That the allegation was in error in the first place. "The OIG report concluded that no one at CIA or the NIC ever deliberately provided false or misleading information to Congress regarding Pakistan's nuclear program." It also found, "on those few occasions when an Agency or NIC officer may have made an honest misstatement during Congressional testimony, the Agency quickly corrected the record without prompting from any other quarter." While the GAO review, while not saying the Joint report was wrong, suggests its logic wasn't fully supported by the evidence. However, the GAO failed to address the criticism by management that points out, as previously stated, that the termination decision had already been made prior to the communication.<sup>[[1]](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/statesec/barlow-tenet.pdf#page=13)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20081211034006/http://archive.gao.gov/paprpdf1/158991.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Ruby Ridge. Conspiracy theorists claim that the terrorist was targeted by ATF for his beliefs, and that they deliberately killed for "muh reasons." However, an independent review by the RRTF confirm this wasn't the case. This investigation did find issues in the FBI's handling of the initial investigation, but found, "no evidence that these deficiencies were international or that the FBI staged evidence for the prosecution's benefit." It also found issues with Assistant AG Ronald Howen taking questionable acts, it recommended that the Executive Office for US Attorneys examine their findings. However, overall, "this investigation found no evidence that BATF improperly targeted Weaver because of his religious or political beliefs. Similarly, we found insufficient evidence to sustain the charge that Weaver was illegally entrapped into selling the weapons." The investigation also examined the snipers: "an FBI sniper/observer fired two shots in quick succession. The first shot was at an armed adult male whom he believed was about to fire at a HRT helicopter on an observation mission. The first shot wounded Randy Weaver while in front of a building at the Weaver compound known as the birthing shed. The second shot was fired at Harris while Harris was retreating into the Weaver cabin. The second shot seriously wounded Harris and killed Vicki Weaver who was behind the cabin door. It is our conclusion that the sniper/observer who took the second shot intended to shoot Kevin Harris but accidentally killed Vicki Weaver whom he did not see behind the curtained door. We concluded that the first shot met the standard of "objective reasonableness" the Constitution requires for the legal use of deadly force."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/report-on-ruby-ridge)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://archive.org/details/rubyridgeBerman)</sup></sup> OPR found, "the second shot was justified in view of the totality of the circumstances."<sup>[[3]](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/special/0211/final.pdf#page=42)</sup></sup>

- In 1993, a cultist group known as the Branch Davidians, engaged the law enforcement as they attempted to serve a search and arrest warrant on the ranch. Conspiracy theorists and pundits have claimed it was the ATF that caused the fire. This has been debunked by several independent investigations. Title III intercepts, and admissions by survivors all but confirm: the Davidians did it. A 1993 review finds: "The arson team concluded that the fire was deliberately set by one or more persons inside the compound. The fire had three separate points of origin. The arson investigation established that those fires occurred in areas significantly distant from one another, but within such a short time frame that it was not possible for the fire to have been accidentally set or for it to have been caused by a single ignition. The arson team then discussed those factors that enhanced the spread of the fire. First, the team noted that the compound building had been poorly construction, with apparently no attention to fire safety. The team noted that the building "appears to have been built with a total disregard to any reasonable concern for fire prevention, especially considering its intended use as living quarters for numerous people." Second, the arson team attributed the rapid spread of the fire to the strong winds prevailing on April 19. Third, the arson team found that the openings created in the building's structure by the FBI during the six hours of the tear gas operation also helped vent the fire. However, the team also noted that the FBI's actions would have allowed more fresh air to flow through the structure while it was burning, thereby reducing the concentration of carbon monoxide and permitting more "breathable" air to reach those trapped inside. Fourth, the unusually large amount of combustible material stored inside the compound contributed to the rapid spread of the fire. Finally, the absence of fire suppression was a minor factor. The arson team explained that given a fire of this intensity and magnitude, it would have been difficult for a fire fighting team to have halted the fire.

  Finally, the arson team addressed whether the fire could have been started by the FBI's deployment of tear gas into the compound. The team concluded that "the fire was not caused by nor was it intensified by any chemicals present in the tear-gassing operations." The team noted that the two methods used to deliver the gas were non-incendiary. The pressurized gas delivered through the combat engineering vehicles was sprayed through a nozzle using carbon dioxide as the propellant. The team noted that carbon dioxide would be incapable of igniting, and might even have acted as a fire inhibiting agent. The other method -- 40 mm Ferret cartridges delivered by an M79 hand-held launcher containing a nonburning, nonexplosive liquid agent containing methylene chloride as the carrier -- could not have had any incendiary effect either. The arson team likewise concluded that, given the multiple simultaneous points of origin, the fire could not possibly have been started by a ferret round entering a window and knocking over a container of flammable liquid. Moreover, the arson team concluded (contrary to a theory that has been advanced by certain people) that the fire could not have been started by one of the combat engineering vehicles rupturing a propane container and igniting it. If that had happened, according to the report, "an immediate vapor air explosion or flash fire would have occurred involving the vehicle itself. It did not happen." 
 
  The Fire Development Analysis: In addition to the arson investigation, which focused on the cause and origin of the fire, two experts from the University of Maryland's Department of Fire Protection Engineering traveled to Waco to investigate how the fire had developed and spread. Those two experts prepared a written "Fire Development Analysis" dated September 8, 1993. They reached the following conclusions: 1. The fires in each of the three points of origin grew very quickly, each resulting in full room involvement within two minutes of initiation. 2. The rapid growth rates of the fires resulted from an ignition source, probably liquid fuel, deliberately placed in each of the three points of origin. 3. The rapid growth rates of the fires could not have been caused by a CEV accidentally tipping a lantern, nor by the chemical (methylene chloride) used as the dispersal agent for the CS tear gas. 4. The strong winds did not significantly affect the fire growth rates inside the compound. The wind affected the external spread of flames, but not the initial rapid growth of the three fires to full room involvement. 5. The tank-made openings on the first floor of the compound could have had some effect on the fire growth, but more likely provided fresh air to areas of refuge for some of the occupants. 6. The compound residents had sufficient time to escape the fire, if they had so desired."<sup>[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/archives/publications/waco/report-deputy-attorney-general-events-waco-texas)</sup></sup>

  In 2000, the Office Of Special Counsel filed a final report regarding Waco. The investigation lasted 14 months, employed 74 personnel, and cost approximately $17 million. The Office of Special Counsel interviewed exactly 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence. "As a result of this effort, the Special Counsel states the following conclusions with certainty. The government of the United States and its agents are not responsible for the April 19, 1993, tragedy at Waco: (a) did not cause the fire; (b) did not direct gunfire at the Branch Davidian complex; and (c) did not improperly employ the armed forces of the United States. Responsibility for the tragedy of Waco rests with certain of the Branch Davidians and their leader, Vernon Howell, also known as David Koresh, who: (a) shot and killed four ATF agents on February 28, 1993, and wounded 20 others; (b) refused to exit the complex peacefully during the 51-day standoff that followed the ATF raid despite extensive efforts and concessions by negotiators for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”); (c) directed gunfire at FBI agents who were inserting tear gas into the complex on April 19, 1993; (d) spread fuel throughout the main structure of the complex and ignited it in at least three places causing the fire which resulted in the deaths of those Branch Davidians not killed by their own gunfire; and (e) killed some of their own people by gunfire, including at least five children." The OSC did find fault with Government personnel, especially in the investigations after the incident.

  "Government agents did not start or materially contribute to the spread of the fire. During the morning of April 19, 1993, several Davidians spread accelerants throughout the main structure of the complex, and started fires in several locations. The evidence indicates that many of the Davidians did not want to escape the fire.10 Indeed, while government agents risked their lives to save Davidians from the fire, one Davidian tried to re-enter the burning complex to die. When an FBI agent questioned this Davidian regarding the location of the children, the Davidian refused to answer. A Davidian who exited the complex during the fire stated that he witnessed others make no effort to leave the complex. Another Davidian expressed remorse that she had not perished in the fire with the rest of the group." Among the evidence that the terrorists started the fire was Title III intercepts: "Davidian conversations intercepted through the use of concealed listening devices inside the complex from April 17 to April 19 indicate that the Davidians started the fire. An April 17 intercept records Davidians discussing how they could prevent fire trucks from reaching the complex. An April 18 intercept records a conversation between Steven Schneider and other Davidians indicating a conspiracy to start a fire. During that conversation, Schneider joked that another Davidian had always wanted to be a “charcoal briquette.” Another Davidian stated that, “I know there’s nothing like a good fire . . . .” On April 19, between the beginning of the tear gas insertion operation at approximately 6:00 a.m. and approximately 7:25 a.m., the Title III intercepts recorded the following statements: “Need fuel;” “Do you want it poured?;” “Have you poured it yet?;” “Did you pour it yet?;” “David said pour it right?;” “David said we have to get the fuel on;” “We want the fuel;” “They got some fuel around here;” “Have you got the fuel . . . the fuel ready?;” “I’ve already poured it;” “It’s already poured;” “Yeah . . . we’ve been pouring it;” “Pouring it already;” “Real quickly you can order the fire yes;” “You got to put the fuel in there too;” “We’ve got it poured already;” “Is there a way to spread fuel in here?;” “So we only light it first when they come in with the tank right . . . right as they’re coming in;” “That’s secure . . . we should get more hay in here;” “You have to spread it so get started ok?” These statements precede the sighting of fire by several hours, which is further proof that the Davidians intended to set fire to the complex well in advance of actually lighting the fires. Much closer to the time of the fire, from approximately 11:17 a.m. to 12:04 p.m., Title III intercepts recorded the following statements from inside the complex: “Do you think I could light this soon?;” “I want a fire on the front . . . you two can go;” “Keep that fire going . . . keep it.” The only plausible explanation for these comments is that some of the Davidians were executing their plan to start a fire."

  Other evidence from the cult: Admissions of Branch Davidians. "Davidians who survived the fire have acknowledged that other Davidians started the fire. Graeme Craddock told the Office of Special Counsel in 1999 that he observed other Davidians pouring fuel in the chapel area of the complex on April 19, 1993. He further stated that he saw another Davidian, Mark Wendel, arrive from the second floor yelling: “Light the fire.” Davidian Clive Doyle told the Texas Rangers on April 20, 1993, that Davidians had spread Coleman fuel in designated locations throughout the complex, although he declined to state who specifically lit the fires."

  As for gunshots, the OSC finds, "In summary, those claiming that government gunfire did occur have presented an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions. The FLIR tapes and testing, witness interviews, including those of Davidians, documentary evidence, audio and video evidence, photographs, autopsy reports, polygraph examinations, ballistics testing, and basic tactical and behavioral considerations provide conclusive evidence that no agent of the United States fired gunshots at Waco on April 19, 1993. The eyewitness evidence and physical evidence are equally overwhelming that the Davidians shot repeatedly at the government on April 19 and that 20 Davidians either committed suicide or were shot by other Davidians as the fire broke out just after noon on April 19."<sup>[[2]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Danforthreport-final.pdf)</sup></sup> In September 2001, Frankel, Donald S. also examined the FLIR, and reached the same conclusions as the OSC's expert teams. "The following conclusions have been reached: 1) The flashes seen on the tape cannot be weapons muzzle flash. Their duration is far too long and their spatial extent is far too great. They are almost certainly the result of solar energy or heat energy form nearby vehicles reflected toward the FLIR by debris or puddles. 2) The FLIR video technology has a very low probability of detecting small arms muzzle flash. 3) As a consequence of 2) above, the absence of muzzle flash detection on the FLIR tape does not prove that no weapons were actually fired during the final assault. Indeed, there is ample evidence (not presented here) that the Davidians fired at the federal agents, but none of their muzzle flashes are detectable on the videotape."<sup>[[3]](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001SPIE.4370..286F/abstract)</sup></sup>

## Human research, 1932-1990
A number of myths persist to this day, on a wide-range of Federal, State, and local government activities in human research, from WW2, to the Cold War—this is due to highly inaccurate, sensationalist headlines. Ranging from Biological, Chemical and radiation research—through the Military, CIA, and civilian institutions. Overall, the scientific consensus has been that all these experiments have been safe, in the short and long-term. Informed consent was provided in the vast majority of cases, with only a few unknowns. Nor was research conducted haphazardly, or with little regard for safety or ethics.

#### US Military 
##### BW
Between 1941 and 1969, when President Nixon banned Biological Weapons (BW), the US Army conducted a series of investigations into the defense against BW, and limited use of BW in retaliation. Open-air tests were not human research experiments, contrary to sensationalist speculation, and Soviet disinfo.

- Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson therefore requested the National Academy of Sciences to appoint a committee to make a complete survey of the BW situation (two months prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor). After careful study, the committee concluded in February 1942 that BW was feasible and urged that appropriate steps be taken to reduce U.S. vulnerability to BW attack. Secretary Stimson then recommended to President Roosevelt the establishment of a civilian agency for this purpose. With approval by the President, the War Reserve Service (WRS) was formed in August of 1942. Scientific advice was received from a committee of prominent scientists set up by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council. The first task undertaken by WRS was the development of defensive measures against possible BW attack. Its major achievement was the organization of a research and development program (R&D now referred to in the Department of Defense as research, development, test and evaluation, (RDTE) to extend the paucity of knowledge about BW. It was concluded that significant knowledge could not be gotten without larger scale developmental operations. Therefore, in November 1942, WRS requested the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) of the Army (redesignated the Chemical Corps in 1946) to prepare to assume responsibility for a larger scale research and development program, including construction and operation of laboratories and pilot plants. 

  The Office of Strategic Services alerted the Joint Chiefs of Staff in December 1943 to indications that the Germans might be planning to use BW. The BW program was accordingly stepped up and, in June 1944, the complete program was transferred by direction of the President to the War Department. At the direction of the Secretary of War, the Chemical Warfare Service was made responsible for work on BW agents, for BW intelligence, and for BW defense. The Army Surgeon General was directed to cooperate with the CWS on matters of BW defense. The program continued as a joint effort with Navy and other Federal department participation. The R&D program was greatly accelerated with the addition of field testing facilities and a production plant. When the War Department assumed full responsibility, Secretary Stimson appointed Mr. Merck as a special consultant on BW. He also established the United States BW Committee in October 1944 wich Mr. Merck as Chairman and with senior representatives from the military services. During World War II, the policy of BW use implicity paralleled the policy for Chemical Warfare (CW); that is, retaliation only. While the United States had not ratified the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925 which prohibited CW and BW, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill announced this policy in unilateral statements in the spring of 1942. By the end of World War II, a wide variety of disease agents effective against man, animals, and plants had been studied and limited field testing conducted. Extensive work on safety measures to perform BW research and development had been necessary as no comprehensive procedures, methodologies or equipment had been available at the start. Even so, infections occurred. These were later reported publicly in the extensive War Department press release on BW in January 1946. The release was the first notification to the nation and the world of United States work in BW. It reported, in part, that:  "In all work on biological warfare carried on in the United States, extreme care was taken to protect the participating personnel from infection. Many new techniques were devised to prevent infection and proved highly successful. Hospitals and dispensaries were maintained at all installations, staffed with both Army and Navy personnel and were equipped to treat accidental infections. As the result of the extraordinary precautions taken, there occurred only sixty cases of proven infection caused by accidental exposure to virulent biological warfare agents which required treatment. Fifty-two of these recovered completely; of the eight cases remaining, all are recovering satisfactorily. There were, in addition to the sixty proven cases, 159 accidental exposures to agents of unknown concentrations. All but one of these received prompt treatment and did not develop any infection. In one instance, the individual did not report exposure, developed the disease, but recovered after treatment."

  In response to concerns about the vulnerability of the United States to covert attack, the Research and Development Board, OSD, requested its Committee on BW to consider the implications of BW in sabotage in extension of a study by a Special "Ad Hoc Panel on Sabotage." In October 1948, the Committee submitted a "Report on Special BW Operations" concluding that: BW was well adapted to subversive use; U.S. was particularly susceptible to attack by BW operations which presented a grave danger, and the current BW R&D program did not meet the requirements to defend against subversive BW operations. The Committee provided a blueprint on goals, objectives, organization, and examples of projects. One of their defensive project examples was conduct of vulnerability tests on "...test ventilating systems, subway systems, and water supply systems with innocuous organisms..." Their recommendations were subsequently approved and became the genesis of open air vulnerability tests and covert R&D programs conducted by the Army, some of which were in support of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As a result of the study recommendation a Special Operations (SO) Division was established at Camp Detrick, MD in May 1949. At the end of World War II, all the field test sites with the exception of Dugway Proving Ground, were abandoned and the primitive Granite Peak BW test site at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah was inactivated. Pathogenic agent testing at Camp Detrick was confined to closed laboratory size chambers and was directly related to agent evaluation and medical defensive aspects. In this period, no control experimentation on humans had yet been conducted at Camp Detrick even though such experimentation was an acceptable practice in the development of vaccines within the U.S. medical community.

  Small scale outdoor testing with two biological simulants (BG, a spore forming microorganism; Serratia marcescens, a vegetative organism commonly referred to as SM) and inert material such as talc, were conducted at Camp Detrick. These materials were considered to be totally harmless by scientific and medical experts. In 1949, construction of an enclosed one million liter test sphere (the largest in the world) was built at Fort Detrick and BW explosive munition tests with pathogens were started. The first open air sea tests with biological simulants were conducted in 1950 aboard U.S. naval ships in the Atlantic Ocean off Norfolk, VA. Simulant clouds were released to envelop ships so as to assess their vulnerability and to test prototype BW electronic detection devices. These same stimulants were released in open-air tests in San Francisco, Panama City, Key West, New York subway, Washington, D.C. Pennsylvania, Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, Port Hueneme, USS Coral, and San Clemente. These occurred under various project/operation names, such as LAC, top hat, SHAD, project 112, whitecoat, Sea-Spray, Dew, D-22 program, etc.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/us-army-bw-activity)</sup></sup>

  "Operation Whitecoat" was the code name for the plan to use human volunteers in field experiments concerning the effects of certain biological pathogens upon humans. Thorough legal investigation and ethical review yielded a group of conditions under which volunteers could be used in research: Voluntary consent is required. Written consent must be witnessed, and signed by the individual concerned. No experimentation which could predictably lead to death or permanent disabling injury will be investigated with the use of human volunteers. Proper medical supervision and treatment capability will be immediately available to the subjects. Experimentation must be expected to yield fruitful results for the good of society, not available by other means. Experimentation should avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering. The degree of risk taken should never exceed the importance of the experiment or the expectable benefits from it. The volunteer may remove himself from the experiment at any stage if he feels that he has reached the limits of his physical or mental endurance. The above elements were incorporated in the policies and procedures for the use of human volunteers in biological warfare research published by the Army Chief of Staff (CS 385-30, June 1952). Assignment to Fort Detrick did not mean that the volunteer automatically participated in human experimentation. There was a distinct process used for each experiment. Each medical investigator prepared a protocol that was extensively reviewed and modified to comply with the twelve ethical principles of the Nuremberg Code. (The Nuremberg war crimes trials convicted 23 Nazi doctors of murder). In 1946, Andrew Ivey released his list of ten conditions required for "permissible medical experiments" in healthy subjects, which became known as the Nuremberg Code. These twelve conditions are embodied in the Wilson Memorandum described above.) When a review validated the ethical requirement and scientific validity of an experiment, it was forwarded to Army officials for approval. It was at this point that potential volunteers were briefed as a group on the approved protocol. During this briefing, they became familiar with the purpose of the study and the risks and benefits involved. They also attended an interview with a scientist where they could ask questions about the research. Volunteers were encouraged to discuss the study with family members, clergy and personal physicians. After an obligatory waiting period of 24 hours to four weeks (the length depended on the presumed risks of the study), informed consent documents would be signed. It must be stressed that Operation Whitecoat soldiers were not required to participate in any study, only to be present for the protocol briefings by principal investigators seeking volunteers. About 20 percent of Operation Whitecoat volunteers did not participate in any study during their tenure at Fort Detrick.<sup>[[2]](https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Frequently-Asked-Questions/Human-Subject-Research-at-Fort-Detrick)</sup></sup>

  Several news papers claimed there had been death or serious illness in San Francisco, even a study claimed there might have been a link at a SF and Stanford hospitals. However, close scrutiny of that paper shows serious flaws. Indeed, a seperate review by a group of eminent scientists to review the available information and provide recommendations on the future use of SM. The four reviewers were from CDC, USPHS; Department of Health, City of New York, Ohio State University; and Microbiological Institutes, National Institutes of Health, USPHS. "The data in the referenced article describing the experience in San Francisco are incomplete as to the primary relation of the SM isolated from the patients and their illnesses, except in the case of one patient who died from bacterial endocarditis and SM bacteremia. With this single exception, the finding of SM in these cases was not shown to have influenced the clinical course of the patients' illnesses." 

  Health data for Monroe County (Key West) and Bay County (Panama City) do not support the Newsday allegations of pneumonia cases according to Dr. C. Prather, Florida's Health Officer, as given to the National Observer Weekend Edition (26 December 1976). A state-wide influenza epidemic hit Florida in 1952 and 1953 with a corresponding increase in pneumonia. According to Dr. Prather, the incidence of pneumonia in Bay County (Panama City) was relatively constant in 1951, 1952, and 1953. Additionally, SM has been used medically as a bacterial tracer from 1937 to 1969 with the results having been published in highly reputable medical journals as late as February 1969. Dr. David J. Sencer, Assistant Surgeon General, Center for Division Control in Atlanta GA provides additional data regarding the incidence of pneumonia and influenza deaths near cities where the vulnerability tests were conducted. The report substantiates the lack of evidence associating the reported deaths with the organisms used in the various tests.<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/us-army-bw-activity/page/141/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

##### CW
- Chemical releases, (Fluorescent particles, ZnCdS), in the public domain, such as St Louis, Minneapolis. Despite claims made by Lisa Martino-Taylor in her dissertation, a critical examination of declassified documents she cites, reveals no evidence of a hidden program of radioactive tests in St. Louis and Minneapolis. Nor do they reveal any coverup or secrecy or "poisoned" residents, between 1953 and 1965. To quote from the material she references, "Meetings were held with various city officials of St. Louis for the purpose of completing arrangements for wiresonde and field-test operations. Minor difficulties with the Park Commissioner were ironed out with the completion of the change in city administration. The St. Louis police department was quite cooperative at all times, and the fire department aided in the recovery of a kytoon and thermistor which had become entangled in a tree during gusty winds. Civil Defence and city officials of Winnipeg and surrounding municipalities were exceptionally cooperative in helping to initiate mesometeorological operations in that city. As a result, considerable interest was shown by the press and the public. Nor did these studies target minorities. Indeed, the opposite is true, "Those residents in the How Area contacted for location of sampling equipment in homes were found to be extremely cooperative."<sup>[[4]](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0031508.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://archive.org/details/Aerosol-study)</sup></sup> <sup>[[6]](https://archive.org/details/st-louis-dispersion-study)</sup></sup> The aerosols that were released were all safe. The US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine conducted health risk assessments of these Cold War era tests in 1994 following the declassification of the test reports. These health risk assessments used guidance from the EPA and focused on determining the health effects from inhalation exposure to the ZnCdS, which was used to simulate potential Soviet deployed biological agents from that era. These health risk assessments determined that exposure to ZnCds from the testing would not cause a health risk to those exposed. The National Research Council Committee on Toxicology, a private nonprofit institution, conducted an independent review of the health risk assessments. In their report, Completed in 1997, the NRC agreed with the Army's conclusion that ZnCdS exposures would not cause a health risk, finding, "tests did not expose residents of the United States and Canada to chemical levels considered harmful."<sup>[[7]](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/5739/toxicologic-assessment-of-the-armys-zinc-cadmium-sulfide-dispersion-tests)</sup></sup> In addition, they recommended that the Army conduct a subsequent toxicological study to determine the effects of ZnCds when it broke down in the body.

  The U.S. Army followed the National Research Council's recommendations and completed a toxicological study in 1998. The toxicological study found that more than 40% of the ZnCdS was cleared from the test subjects within the first day, only a very small amount was found after one week, and the remaining amount was negligible after 14 weeks following exposure. Additionally, it found evidence that ZnCdS does not likely break down into Cadmium in the body. While a single very high concentration could elicit an inflammatory response in the lungs that diminished with time, this dosage was 8,409 times the amount that was used in the Army ZnCdS dispersion testing. This study was peer reviewed and published in Inhalation Toxicology, Volume 12 in 2000.

  The National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine conducted an independent review of the toxicity study in 2004 and corroborated the conclusions presented in the National Research Council assessment and the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine toxicological study. The U.S. Army Public Health Command has reviewed the health risk assessments as well as available source documents from the NRC's Committee on Toxicology and the Institute of Medicine. The U.S. Army Public Health Command reconfirms that exposure to ZCdS, under the test conditions reported, would not cause a health risk in humans. Further, these reports contain no evidence of a radioactive component to the ZnCdS dispersion testing as has been alleged in the media.<sup>[[8]](https://web.archive.org/web/20121109112920/http://www.blunt.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/430b5197-ca1d-4b06-bcc5-c8d7f9d7cf92/Response%20from%20Army.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  Indeed, several independent studies were conducted by the UK's Academy of Medical Sciences, and others, finding that ZnCdS, CdS and Cd is also safe—as these were also used by the MoD's dispersion tests. "With regard to the land-based trials it is concluded that the dissemination of ZnCdS by the UK during the ‘Cold War’ did not significantly add to the cadmium concentrations in soil, except within a few metres of the point of dissemination of the material. Except immediately around the dispersal sites in two trials at RAF Beaulieu airfield, the predicted soil concentrations are within the range of cadmium concentrations normally observed in the UK and much lower than those found at Shipham. Risk to the public from soil contamination with cadmium from these and other ZnCdS dispersion trials is therefore considered to be negligible. With regard to the long-range contamination trials, the dose potentially received by inhalation during even the most severe case was small (c. 0.13 μg Cd). Over all the trials, our worst case estimate of personal dose received from these trials is c. 10 μg over an eight year period. This is the amount of cadmium that is inhaled in a normal urban environment in a period of between 12 and 100 days (or from smoking a total of 100 cigarettes). We are also reassured by the fact that no increased incidence has been claimed for the diseases that are particularly associated with cadmium toxicity. We were further reassured by discovering that the people largely involved in the dissemination of the cadmium sulphide from aircraft who will have been exposed to very much larger amounts than anybody on the ground suffered no ill effects. Our conclusions therefore do mirror those in the much more comprehensive American study."<sup>[[9]](https://acmedsci.ac.uk/file-download/34958-ZincCadm.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://oem.bmj.com/content/59/1/13)</sup></sup> <sup>[[11]](https://archive.org/details/uk-bw-defence-field-trials-1940-1979)</sup></sup>
  
- Volunteers. The preliminary Laboratory research was absolutely necessary in order to insure compliance with the basic policy governing the use of humans in research, Chief of Staff Memorandum 385, which provided: "The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature. The number of volunteers wed shall be kept at a minimum. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experiments and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated research will justify the performance of the experiment. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury. No experiment should be conducted where there is a prior reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian Importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment. In order to be in full compliance with the Department of the Army regulations and policies, scientists were involved in a great deal of painstaking research long before volunteers were used. The preliminary work often took years.

  There were several ways that chemical compounds came to the attention of the Medical Research Laboratories. Some of those were: discovery by Medical Laboratory employees through basic research or during experiments with other chemicals; review of professional literature; accidental or intentional discovery by industry; and recommendations from other medical research institutions (both in the US and other countries). However, the most prevalent source of chemical compounds appeared to be from the Chemical Corps Industrial Liaison Program. An example of this method was the discovery of benzilates (BZ), the most useful of the known incapacitating agents developed by the Chemical Corps. It was reported that as of October 1960 that the most potent benzilate candidate agent under consideration by the Chemical Corps was agent EA 2277. Chemical Corps screened this compound, along with thousands of others recived from their various sources, to determine its potential military usefullnes. Once the compounds with military value were selected from the mass of candidate agents, more detailed studies begin. These studies were known as "initial toxicity screening." Between 1950-1975 approximately 34,500 compounds were studied. Following initial screening, each compound was reviewed in light of its potential military value. Records reflected that 2,077 agents survived the initial review. Those agents selected for further chemical analysis were divided into three general categories: proposed irritants; incapacitants (such as LSD, PCP); and lethal agents.

  The proposed incapacitating agents were next studied in animal behavior tests, using several different species (still in the chemical laboratories). Next, the candidate agents were presented to the Medical Research Laboratories for adaptational research. Initial medical research included an evaluation of the data available from the Chemical Laboratory, evidence from industry, private institutions, and technical literature. Additionally, the laboratory staff conducted pathology and pharmacology studies. Following these evaluations, a second major review was conducted to further reduce the number of candidate compounds. Records reflected that 2,026 of the available 2,077 agents were rejected at this stage of the research cycle. The remaining 51 candidate agents were submitted for pre-clinical testing at the Medical Research Laboratories. The next laboratory studies involved research in numerous animal species, prophylaxis studies, and therapy studies. Only 32 candidate agents reportedly survived the pre-clinical research phase of the cycle. Those agents were selected for clinical testing with volunteers. Once the agent passed the pre-clinical or animal testing phase it was considered safe for human experiments.

  A request to conduct experiments with nerve gases on volunteers was submitted in August 1953. Permission was granted in November 1953, however, it did not provide for a source of volunteer subjects. On 12 March 1954 The Surgeon General prepared a set of principles, policies, and rules for the use of human volunteers in medical research. With four exceptions, these principles generally were the same as those published in Chief of Staff memorandum 385. The first rule was in the form of expanded guidance regarding volunteer consent. Next, rules 7 and 8 of the Chief of Staff memorandum 358 guidance were expanded as follows: "Adequate preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death. This included hospitalization and medical treatment as may be required. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons (including an adequately trained physician) who shall be required to exercise the highest degree of skill and care throughout the experiment. Competent consultants should be available on short notice in this connection." Finally, there was included an additional rule: "Agents used in research must have the following limiting characteristics: controllable lethality; no serious chronicity anticipated; effective therapy available; and adequate background or animal experimentations." These were not intended to replace the rules set forth in the basic policy, but rather to clarify their intent. This program reportedly visualized four types of studies for human volunteers. "The first category consists of planned, hazardous experiments where there is a clear-cut risk, but with intelligent, adequate supervision, safeguards, and adequate therapy available, it is felt that no irrevocable damage will be done. Experiments will not be attempted where such damage can be foreseen. These form the type of experiments for which the Army Secretary's approval has been received and the only kind where such approval is required. Another category includes risk of accidental exposure to hazardous degree. The fullest possible studies should be made of any such unplanned exposures. The third category consists of experiments that are only potentially but not definitely hazardous. These experiments would be hazardous if the individual, despite previous examinations and check-up, should prove unusually senstitive, or if there occurs an accidental error or break in technique. The fourth category of procedures will be those designated non-hazardous, experiments involving no hazard greater than that of crossing a highway."
  
  Pennsylvania’s Holmesburg prison. An investigation found that Dr. Albert Kligman complied with DoD policy on human volunteers that required, among other things, consent. It was also the only experiment conducted on inmates.<sup>[[12]](https://archive.org/details/army-igchem)</sup></sup> Another review found, "It appears that all of the test subjects were volunteers and that stringent medical safeguards and followup procedures were used."<sup>[[13]](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/NCB/02-A-0846_RELEASE.pdf#page=5)</sup></sup>

  Evidence that more chan 7,000 volunteers were tested at Edgewood Arsenal without a single fatality or serious injury must be accepted as supporting evidence of the ability of the US Army and the medical research staff to fulfill their responsibilities.<sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/army-igchem)</sup></sup> In the spring of 1980, the Department of the Army asked the Committee on Toxicology of the National Research Council's Board on Toxicology and Environmental Health Hazards to study the possible chronic or delayed adverse health effects incurred by servicemen who had been exposed experimentally to various chemicals at the U.S. Army Laboratories, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Edgewood, Maryland, during 1955-1975. Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a three-volume study, which found no adverse health effects from those subjects.<sup>[[15]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222994/)</sup></sup> Project SHAD was under Project 112. They ran both chemical and biological tests. To date, there is no clear evidence of specific, long-term health problems associated with participation in Project SHAD. The Health and Medicine Division (formally known as the Institute of Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted a study sponsored by VA and presented findings in the 2007 report Long-Term Health Effects of Participation in Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense). The same conclusions were found in a 2016 Report, Assessing Health Outcomes Among Veterans of Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense).<sup>[[16]](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11900/long-term-health-effects-of-participation-in-project-shad-shipboard-hazard-and-defense)</sup></sup> <sup>[[17]](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21846/assessing-health-outcomes-among-veterans-of-project-shad-shipboard-hazard-and-defense)</sup></sup> <sup>[[18]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[19]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[20]](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[[21]](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Chemical-and-Biological-Exposures)</sup></sup>
  
- Among the first chemicals used as lethal/tactical weapons during World War I (WW I) were vesicants or blistering agents. The most widely used agents were the mustards, also known as mustard gas. Fearful that mustard gas might be used again in WW II, the U.S. military conducted experiments at the beginning of the war to test the effectiveness of various protective clothing and equipment in preventing injury/incapacitation due to mustard gas exposure (2). One method of testing involved exposing Navy volunteers wearing protective clothing and gas masks to mustard gas in a sealed chamber that was 10′ by 15′ with a 12′ high ceiling. The interiors of the chambers were most often maintained at 90°F and 65% relative humidity to test the durability of protective clothing under tropical conditions. Chamber test participants were often ask to perform routine duties, (e.g., marching), to determine the degree they had been incapacitated by their exposure to mustard gas. 
  
  A study published in 2000, at the recommendation of NRC, found, "To date there have been no studies examining possible long-term adverse health effects among test participants who received low level non-lethal exposures of mustard gas. We conducted a mortality follow-up study comparing the cause specific mortality of exposed veterans (i.e., veterans who participated in chamber tests) to that of controls (i.e., veterans who served during the same time period but who had no evidence of mustard gas exposure). All veterans in this study were white males. This study assessed the risk of cause-specific mortality associated with mustard gas exposure among Navy chamber test participants. Assessing the relative risk of cause specific mortality, namely respiratory diseases and respiratory cancers, there was no increased risk of any cause of death associated with mustard gas exposure. There was also no increased risk in cause specific mortality associate with level of mustard gas exposure among exposed veterans."<sup>[[22]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047279700000600)</sup></sup>

##### Radiation
- After WW2, the United States DoD conducted experiments with radiation on human subjects. An independent review that examined studies and policy from 1944 to 1994 found: Fully informed consent was an essential requirement for human subjects, as well as adequate medical treatment and strict ethics guidance adhered to.

  For example, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the DoD and University of Cincinnati conducted unethical experiments "on more than 90 poor, black, advanced stage cancer patients with inoperable tumors" and that Dr. Eugene Saenger "forged consent forms, and did not inform the patients of the risks of irradiation." However, this couldn't be further from the truth. The research at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCM) examined the effectiveness of using new, deep-penetrating TBI technology to improve the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. During the 1950s and 1960s, the DoD sought information on the biological and clinical features of radiation injury. The DoD funded laboratory studies and psychological tests of cancer patients after they had received TBI and PBI as treatment for their disease. The DoD’s initial objective was to obtain a biological marker of radiation exposure. After 1965, the DoD was also interested in obtaining data on the psychological response to radiation exposure. A total of 88 patients from Cincinnati General Hospital participated in this project. Patient selection criteria required that only individuals with proven metastatic or far-advanced cancer be selected for the studies. In addition, subjects had to be in relatively good nutritional status and, in most cases, have normal hematologic values. These criteria remained relatively constant throughout the twelve years of the study. UCCM researchers also sought patients who had not undergone previous radiation or chemotherapy, had normal kidney function and new, abnormal tissue growth that was not radiosensitive, and were without lymphoma or bronchogenic cancer. According to a 1972 University of Cincinnati review of the project, the demographic distribution of study participants reflected the patient population of the Cincinnati General Hospital.
  
  UCCM researchers determined that TBI and PBI therapies were effective in controlling certain advanced cancers. They reported that the relief effects of radiation treatments compared favorably with results using anticancer drugs or chemotherapy. Delivery of higher radiation doses caused patients to experience blood problems, which included loss of red and white blood cells and platelets. Doctors infused bone marrow early in the post-irradiation period, hoping to prevent these problems. In May 1963, researchers in this project proposed establishing facilities for the withdrawal, storage, and reinfusion of bone marrow. By April 1966, a filtration system for the reinfusion of human bone marrow was completed, and by April 1969, success in bone marrow reinfusion was achieved. The use of this process immediately after radiation therapy minimized the characteristic bone marrow depression associated with higher doses of radiation. The degree of illness following reinfusion was significantly decreased and hospitalization greatly shortened. 
  
  Psychological studies of the patients in the UCCM project began in 1965. The DoD’s objective was to determine the effect of radiation exposure on emotional and intellectual functioning. The tests were designed to take into account the many complex variables that may influence the measurement of these functions after radiation treatment. The tests included the Reitan Trials Test, Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor Test, Wechsler Depression Rating Scale, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the five-minute verbal content test of Gottschalk and Gleser. The researchers found evidence of a decrease in intellectual functioning immediately after radiation. This effect was temporary, and functioning improved markedly within three days.

  In January 1972, the American College of Radiology (ACR) reviewed the science, methodology, and design of the project from a medical point of view to determine if the project conformed to then-contemporary standards for clinical investigations. The ACR report concluded that the UCCM project was validly conceived, stated, executed, controlled, and followed up; the process of patient selection conformed with sound medical practice; and procedures for obtaining patient consent were valid, thorough, and consistent with National Institutes of Health recommendations and the practices of most cancer centers. Also in November 1971, Clifford Grulee, M.D., Dean of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, appointed an Ad Hoc Committee made up of members of the UCCM faculty to review the project. Dr. Grulee asked the committee to review the project’s scientific content, methodology, and data treatment. The committee’s report, released in January 1972, indicated that there were no problems with the project’s scientific content or methodology. In addition, the committee stated that there was no evidence that DASA funding was made contingent on work, ideas, or suggestions proposed by DASA and all information reported to DASA was kept unclassified and publicly available.<sup>[[23]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210821164345/https://archive.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Narratv.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  From 1963 to 1973, a leading endocrinologist, Dr. Carl Heller, studied radiation's affects male reproductive function. ACHRE, "in its own analysis of the risks incurred by the Oregon and Washington testicular irradiation subjects based on a 600-rem dose, which was the maximum testicular exposure of any subject in either state. For purposes of this analysis we assumed that the testicles have average radiation sensitivity; that there is a linear relationship between cancer incidence and dose, and that there is a linear relationship between the risk of cancer and the amount of tissue exposed. Using these assumptions, we calculated that it would take more than double the dose received by any prisoner-subject to yield an effective dose of 1 rem. This means that the predicted increase over the expected cancer rate for the individuals who received the greatest exposure would be less that four-hundreths of 1 percent. For those who received smaller doses of radiation, the risk would, of course, be smaller, too.<sup>[[24]](https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap9_2.html)</sup></sup>
  
- Some conspiracy theorists cite, what they believe as evidence, that the government covered-up evidence of the dangers posed to communities while conducting nuclear tests, in general—is a August 1980 subcommittee report on low-level radiation exposure. They quote the passage, "In addition, the government's program for monitoring the health effects of the tests was in-adequate and, more disturbingly all evidence suggesting that radiation was having harmful effects, be it on the sheep or the people, was not only disregarded but actually suppressed." However, a careful reading of this report shows that the only item they believe was "covered-up" and "suppressed" was a specific incident involving the deaths of sheep in Utah and Nevada. This incident only related to the Upshot-Knothole Test Series. A critical reading doesn't support the subcommittee's report. The matter was settled by a consensus in scientific literature, and also in Court, in 1956. The judge presiding over the case was A. Sherman Christensen. The government’s defense (backed by expert witnesses and unclassified records) maintained that fallout levels from the Upshot-Knothole Test Series were too low to cause the sheep deaths, and that the timing between the atomic tests and subsequent sheep deaths was purely a coincidence. Judge Christensen sided with the expert testimony provided by the AEC, stating that the government was negligent in not warning sheep owners of potential fallout in the area, but nothing more. A few years later, he overturned this ruling based on the aforementioned report. However, this ruling was in turn, over-ruled by a 3-Judge panel. "The trial court thus (1) mentioned the Bustad report and asserted that information had been withheld; (2) it mentioned that the Government had given misleading information as to radiation dosages; (3) that the veterinarians had been pressured by the Government; and (4) that misleading answers had been given to interrogatories by the Government. Each of these specifics have been considered in relation to the record in the proceedings appealed from and to what original record and briefs are extant. We must conclude that none of these several findings or conclusions are supported by the record. The information, data, reports, maps, experiments and witnesses were all available to plaintiffs at the first trial. The data is the same now. They tried their case on the basis of their then best judgment in the selection of witnesses, interviews, the evaluation of data and reports, and the consideration of the position of the experts.

  We have not mentioned the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory comparative study of radiation burns (in experiments) and the lesions on the Utah sheep. The analysis of tissues, organs, bones and blood samples made by Doctors Comar, Rust and Trum showed no evidence of radiation injury to the sheep in the flocks of plaintiffs where the losses took place. A tissue analysis was made on the sheep by the Utah University College of Medicine and the conclusion was reached that the sheep had been exposed to radiation but the examination concluded that there had been no acute effects from the exposure. The Hanford comparative study, as mentioned, concluded that the sheep had not died from exposure to radiation. In Bulloch I the conclusion of the experts was that the sheep and lambs had died as a result of unprecedented cold weather during the lambing and shearing, together with malnutrition, also to generally poor range conditions and to common diseases which caused the skin lesions and deaths. These conditions were established by the evidence. The losses began after an initial detonation but before the detonation of the "Harry" test. The expert witnesses who were the leading authorities on the subject thus concluded that the losses were not due to radiation. There was no evidence presented that humans in the areas with the sheep nor animals such as the sheep dogs or horses, which were with the sheep, were affected. This recent increase in the heat, the light, and awareness of atomic energy is all worthwhile, but we are unable to find in it any reason, as the plaintiffs apparently would have us do, to overturn the considered judgment of the court reached 25 years ago.<sup>[[25]](https://casetext.com/case/bulloch-v-united-states-2)</sup></sup> <sup>[[26]](https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1201913/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[27]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup> <sup>[[28]](https://www.energy.gov/management/articles/fehner-and-gosling-atmospheric-nuclear-weapons-testing-1951-1963-battlefield)</sup></sup> A seperate lawsuit rested in 1988, where it was alleged that the Government failed in a duty to warn and provide information. A Federal appeals Court found this not so—while smacking down other claims. "In the instant case, no evidence was presented of any act or omission of the AEC or its employees that clearly contravened a specific statutory or regulatory duty, or that exceeded statutory or regulatory authority. There was no evidence, for example, that the Test Information Officer failed to release information he was required to give out, or that the Radsafe Officer failed to take a specific radiation measurement that had been decided upon."<sup>[[29]](https://casetext.com/case/allen-v-us-59?q=Allen%20v.%20U.S.,%20No.%2084-2126&sort=relevance&p=1&type=case)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1954, the US detonated a series of nuclear bombs to study their yield. This was part of Operation Castle and Operation Crossroads, near Bikini Atoll. Due to a miscalculation there was an increase in radiation output than expected. The US Department of Energy estimated that 253 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were impacted by the radioactive fallout. It is alleged that the US deliberately used the Marshallese as "ginea pigs" for testing radiation under project 4.1. This allegation has been thoroughly investigated and is not supported by any evidence. Operation Castle had no biomedical program. US Military personnel were also exposed to large amounts of radiation, when they thought they were in safe areas of the expected yield.<sup>[[30]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16380885-g1vuWf/16380885.pdf#page=212)</sup></sup> <sup>[[31]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16061854-leUIeE/16061854.pdf#page=5)</sup></sup>

- Operation Plumbbob. Troops were not studied for radiation research, contrary to conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists.
Exercises Desert Rock VII and VIII, the test groups, and AFSWC each developed its own organization and procedures for ensuring the radiological safety of its members based on the established criteria of the AEC. The radiological safety plans were developed to minimize operational exposures to ionizing radiation. The safety of Desert Rock VII and VIII participants was the responsibility of the Desert Rock Exercise Director. A maximum radiation exposure limit of 5.0 Roentgens (R) in any 6-month period was established for Desert Rock troops. Of this exposure, no more than 2.0 R was to be from prompt radiation. Exposure limits for blast pressure and thermal radiation were also established. Based on exposure limits and mode of delivery, minimum distance criteria for positioning Desert Rock troops and observers were established. For a tower shot with a predicted maximum yield of about 10 kilotons, troops in the open were positioned at least 4,000 yards from ground zero. Troops in trenches at such a shot were positioned no closer than 2,600 yards from ground zero. Troops in armored vehicles were positioned no closer than 2,800 yards from ground zero. Radiation doses have been reconstructed for all of the major troop test units at the operation. These doses are in agreement with the available film badge dosimetry. About 40 DOD personnel received total doses exceeding 5 rem∗ during PLUMBBOB; half of these were accrued by cloud samplers or penetrators. The three largest doses were between 13 and 22 rem to Air Force fliers who penetrated the Shot JOHN cloud at about 10 minutes after burst. The other doses over 5 rem were scattered, mostly among Desert Rock VII and VIII support and technical service project personnel. Very few of the personnel in the major troop test described above received as much as 2 rem. The average total dose to DOD participants at PLUMBBOB was 0.4 rem. Animals were used for medical examination.<sup>[[32]](https://www.dtra.mil/Portals/125/Documents/NTPR/newDocs/14-PLUMBBOB%20-%202021.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[33]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16004390.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[34]](https://www.dtra.mil/Portals/125/Documents/NTPR/newDocs/ANTHReport/1957_DNA_6005F.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[35]](https://ia801305.us.archive.org/17/items/Misc-DoD/Analysis%20of%20Radiation%20Exposure%204th%20Marine%20Corps%20Provisional%20Atomic%20Exercise%20Brigade%2015%20June%201981.pdf)</sup></sup>

  As the ACHRE and DoD reviews found, "no documentation has been identified to indicate that human radiation experiments were part of the U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing program. The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) concluded in 1995 that, 'although there was a real possibility that human subject research had been conducted in conjunction with the bomb tests, the tests were not themselves experiments involving human subjects.' Human aspects research conducted in conjunction with atomic weapons tests was designed to study the effects atomic weapons would have on combat operations. For example, flashblindness studies, troop training and maneuvers, psychological testing, and decontamination studies were designed with the goal of increasing the capabilities and preparedness of military forces to conduct effective military operations on a nuclear battlefield."<sup>[[36]](https://web.archive.org/web/20210821164345/https://archive.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Narratv.pdf)</sup></sup> Lastly, it should be noted that the Advisory Committee did find that "for the period 1944 to 1974 there is no evidence that any [US] government statement or policy on research involving human subjects contained a provision permitting a waiver of consent requirements for national security reasons".
  
- Green Run. ACHRE and the GAO found that, "Our work did not document that the test was intended to be a radiation warfare experiment or a field test of radiobiological effects on humans. In particular, we examined still-classified passages in the Green Run test report and found that they did not refer to any such intentions or operations."<sup>[[37]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[38]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10111991)</sup></sup>  

#### CIA
##### MKULTRA
- In 1953, MKULTRA. There exists a rich universe of misleading allegations of MKULTRA, due to pop culture, and propagandists. To concisely and accurately represent the program, only declassified overviews will be directly quoted, (including mkdelta, bluebird/artichoke, mksearch): "Because of events in the 1940's and early 1950's, including operational reports and Soviet show trials involving Gardinal Mindzenty and others, the Soviet Union was believed to have developed the capability to affect human behavior through the use of drugs. To obtain information on the use of chemical and biological substances and methods to counter the use of behavior influencing drugs, the Agency conducted an  "umbrella project" under which various subprojects were funded. This umbrella project, which was called MKULTRA, continued from 1953 through 1964. Much of the research, only a portion of which involved LSD, was conducted at well-known institutions under the control and direction of researchers at, and in conformance to the standards of, those institutions. The research and its results were generally unclassified and published in the normal manner by those researchers. In only three instances was research performed in a manner which would raise questions regarding its ethical/moral propriety. The questionable subprojects involved the use of individuals who were not aware that they were the subjects of a research program or that they were being given a drug. This unwitting testing generally took place in social situations among friends and acquaintances of the researcher. In 1963, after questions were raised within the Agency by the Inspector General about the propriety of these subprojects, they were discontinued. Between 1963 and 1967 some testing of drugs continued, but only on voluntary subjects. In 1967 all projects involving behavior influencing drugs were terminated."<sup>[[39]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4328740/CIA-RDP86M00886R000800010039-4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[40]](https://info.publicintelligence.net/CIA-MKULTRA-IG.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
   "Project Chickwit concerned collection of information about foreign pharmaceuticals. No human testing involved. 85 of the MKULTRA/MKSEARCH grants did not involve human experiments. 40 of the mkultra/mksearch grants involved witting volunteers, usually paid; research was conducted under the management and substantive control of the institution. Only the fact of CIA funding was concealed. In sum, unwitting testing sponsored directly by CIA was limited exclusively to the safehouse operations (3 cases). Apart from the safehouse activities for the most part, CIA was interested in the results of research initiated and sponsored by other orginizations and conducted in accordance with professional and ethical standards applicable to the particular circumstances at the time. We have found no evidence that CIA exerted undue influence or attempted to coerce individuals or institutions to undertake research they might not otherwise have undertaken nor did the Agency attempt to cause any compromise of professional and ethical standards under which the research was conducted. None of the research conducted by private institutions was clandestine; studies were carried out openly and results in many cases were published. As a matter of fact, it can even be reported that some significant contributions were made to the advancement of psychiatry, pharmacology and medicine."<sup>[[41]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83-00156R000300050037-0.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[42]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/cia%20r%26d%20and%20testing%20of%20be%5B15132315%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>

   Conspiracy theorists claim that the CIA conducted radiation experiments on humans, as part of mkultra. However, 3 independent reviews found this was not so. CIA's History Staff conducted the most authoritative investigation onto the matter and found that it had not. This independent finding was corroborated by ACHRE's independent examination, "No evidence was found among the public or classified records to contradict CIA's conclusion that it did not engage in human radiation experiments." And, "Although CIA was a member of the Interagency Working Group on Human Radiation Experiments and possessed documents suggesting CIA involvement with human radiation experimentation, the Advisory Committee has found no evidence to indicate that CIA actually conducted or sponsored such experiments."<sup>[[43]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=660)</sup></sup> <sup>[[44]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=680)</sup></sup> <sup>[[45]](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/27/031/27031227.pdf#page=56)</sup></sup> <sup>[[46]](https://archive.org/details/csi-radiation-review)</sup></sup> <sup>[[47]](https://sgp.fas.org/library/humexp/appb.htm)</sup></sup> Further, no, the US Government didn't invent LSD.

##### Civilian

- At the request of New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services, beginning in 2005 the Vera Institute of Justice undertook an in-depth examination of issues related to the enrollment and monitoring of New York City foster children in clinical trials related to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The request was prompted by allegations that African American and Latino children were inappropriately removed from their families and placed in foster care to facilitate their enrollment in dangerous and unnecessary medical experiments. Other concerns included whether children suffered unnecessarily as a result of their participation, whether children in trials were HIV infected, whether trial researchers properly obtained informed consent, and whether the child welfare system adequately monitored the children in their care. Vera reviewers found little or no evidence in the information examined for some of the concerns that prompted Children’s Services to initiate this study. Many children—inside and outside of foster care and clinical trials—died because of complications of HIV/AIDS during the late 1980s and 1990s. Eighty of the 532 children who participated in clinical trials or observational studies died while in foster care; 25 of them died while enrolled in a medication trial. Vera medical staff did not find, however, that any child’s death was caused directly by clinical trial medication. An examination of data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, though not conclusive, suggests that HIV-positive foster children who were enrolled in clinical trials and/or observational research studies did not experience an increased risk of death from their enrollment in clinical trials.

  The child welfare files contained information indicating that some children experienced serious toxicities, or side effects, from trial medications, such as reduced liver function or severe anemia. These toxicities were consistent with toxicities described in published articles about the trials. Vera reviewers found many instances where a physician made adjustments to a child’s treatment in light of these problems as required by the clinical trial protocol. Where documentation allowed reviewers to make a determination, children in foster care met age, HIV status, and disease stage criteria for inclusion in the specific trials in which they were enrolled as described in the trial protocol. Reviewers found that two of the 532 children met exclusion criteria for the medication trials in which they were enrolled. In 1988, when city officials first considered the participation of foster children in clinical trials, the child welfare agency conducted a lengthy review of state and federal research regulations. The social services commissioner and his staff were aware of concerns about the participation of African American and Latino children in medical research and they consulted with several medical experts, including the National Medical Association (an organization of African American physicians). The standard the agency developed for approving trials—that every child in foster care enrolled in a trial have the possibility of benefiting from that trial— exceeded that of federal regulations. The policy also required that researchers obtain informed consent from a birth parent when parental rights remained intact. Many files document medical researchers’ discussions of the risks and potential benefits of trial enrollment with a birth parent and the parent’s subsequent permission to enroll the child. In several cases, parents did not want their children in a clinical trial and the child did not participate in the trial. Children in foster care appeared to participate in trials at rates that suggest they were not specially targeted for enrollment into HIV/AIDS clinical trials. Foster children made up 30 percent of all New York City enrollments in 16 trials of medical interventions for which city- level data were available. Thirteen percent of these enrollments occurred prior to the child’s entry into foster care, with participation extending into the period they were in foster care.
  
  Children in foster care who participated in HIV/AIDS clinical trials were predominantly African American and Latino (64 percent African American and 30 percent Latino). This demographic profile paralleled the demographics of children with HIV infection in New York City (58 percent African American, 35 percent Latino). There was no evidence in the child welfare files of children being removed from their families by Children’s Services because a parent refused to consent to a child’s participation in a clinical trial. Vera reviewers found no evidence in the child welfare files, clinical trial protocols, or interviews that children, parents, foster parents, foster care agencies or staff, or child welfare agencies or staff received incentive payments for children to participate in clinical trials.<sup>[[49]](http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat4/150521.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1945 through 1947 Manhattan Project researchers injected eighteen human subjects with plutonium, five human subjects with polonium, and six human subjects with uranium to obtain metabolic data related to the safety of those working on the production of nuclear weapons. All of these subjects were patients hospitalized at facilities affiliated with the Universities of Rochester (11 patients), California (3 patients), and Chicago (3 patients) or at Oak Ridge (1 patient). Another set of experiments took place between 1953 and 1957 at Massachusetts General Hospital, in which 11 patients with terminal conditions were injected with uranium. All were near death (in a coma or semicoma) prior to injection and were receiving usual hospital care for comatose patients. The subjects expired from their brain cancer within several months of injection. Study results indicated that 99 percent of the injected uranium cleared the blood within 20 hours. This wasn't a government program, so to speak. It was a collection of a few individuals at universities who coordinated on their own. How all the injections were coordinated—or even if they were coordinated—is unclear.<sup>[[50]](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10111991)</sup></sup> 
 
  Further, ACHRE couldn't determine if those involved provided consent, due to obvious limitations. Some did consent, others may not have. As one officer said, "It is unlikely that these tests were made without the consent of the subjects." Which supports a claim made by one of the Chicago doctors in 1974 that some form of oral consent for the injections had been obtained. When the civilian AEC took over for the Manhattan District on January 1, 1947, the plutonium injections provoked a strong reaction at the highest levels. Concern for minimizing risk of harm to subjects is evident in several of the planning documents relating to the experiments, an obligation that many of those involved apparently took seriously. At Chicago, for example, where the highest doses of plutonium were used, care was taken to ensure that all the subjects had terminal illnesses.<sup>[[51]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=255)</sup></sup> 
 
  A 1962 paper, openly published, said that, "During the early days of the Manhattan Project, the excretion and retention data on which to base a method of diagnosing Pu239 body burden were largely from experiments on rats. It seemed imperative, therefore, to determine retention and excretion in a limited number of terminal human patients. Sixteen cases were studied, the first beginning in April of 1945. Life expectancy of the individual and relative freedom from kidney disease were the principle criteria for case selection. As a rule, individuals were chosen who were past 45 yr of age and who were suffering from well-established disorders that made survival for 10 or more years highly improbable. Adherence to this rule avoided the possibility of development of late radiation effects from plutonium." The study notes that many such patients died within 30 days, due to their terminal illness. Only 3 lived the full 138-day observation period."<sup>[[52]](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16369158-b6Yb0H/16369158.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Historical revisionists have long-claimed that the US conducted unethical research on Children with radiation. However, a critical examination of the record reflects this is not so. Although in the 1940s and 1950s there were apparently no written rules of professional ethics for pediatric research in general, there were guidelines for the investigational use of radioisotopes in children. In 1949, the Subcommittee on Human Applications of the Atomic Energy Commission's Isotope Division established a set of rules to judge proposals submitted by researchers for the use of radioisotopes in medical experiments with human subjects, including "normal children."" These standards appeared in the fall 1949 supplement to the AEC's isotope catalogue and price list.
 
  These guidelines did not mention consent--of parents, guardians, or children. Instead, this statement simply discouraged nontherapeutic experiments with children. The guidelines did not, however, suggest that the practice was completely inappropriate; the subcommittee asserted that "important" research using "harmless" levels of radiation dosage with children was acceptable. The crucial terms important and harmless were left undefined. It seems reasonable to expect that "important" pediatric research would address a significant medical problem affecting children or would explore key aspects of normal human physiology-relevant to health promotion or disease Part II prevention— for which research on children is indispensable. By these standards, the twenty-one nontherapeutic radiation experiments with children whose risks we review in the next section of this chapter could all be said to address important questions relevant to pediatric health care. During the 1944-1974 period, there was an explosion of interest in the use of radioisotopes in clinical medicine and medical research, including pediatrics. The twenty-one research projects we review here include only a small number of all those that were likely conducted. These twenty-one do include, however, every nontherapeutic study that was funded by the federal government and fell into our original group of eighty-one pediatric radiation experiments.
  
  All twenty-one projects analyzed in detail involve the administration of radioisotopes to children in order to better understand child physiology or to develop better diagnostic tools for pediatric disease. In this respect, the studies supported by the federal government do not differ from those reviewed that had other funding sources. With the exception of the study at the Wrentham school to evaluate protective measures for fallout, none of the twenty-one experiments reviewed was related to national defense concerns. Seventeen of the twenty-one experiments involved the use of iodine 131 for the evaluation of thyroid function.<sup>[[53]](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=345)</sup></sup>
  
- A number of myths surround Walter E. Fernald State School, in which sensational allegations claimed residents who were mentally ill were subject to radiation experiments. However, an independent review found the opposite, "Of significant note is that no research was identified by the Task Force that involved testing the effect of radiation on human beings by introducing radioactive materials purposefully into their bodies to measure or monitor such effects. The nutritional research studies used small amounts of radioactive material as tracer elements to understand how the body functioned or obtained elements from the diet; the Thyroid studies used small to large amounts of tracer materials, also to learn about body functions; and, the so-called Cold War study at Wrentham differed in that the tracer materials were used to find the point at which administration of iodine blocked the uptake of radioactive materials that would be found in nuclear fallout."

  Further, it will be stated that many of the people who became residents of the Walter E. Fernald School, from its opening in 1848 right through the 1950s, were not admitted with a diagnosis of mental retardation. Societal and cultural norms of the day permitted persons to be admitted to state-operated institutions for a number of reasons. All were labeled mentally retarded just by virtue of having lived within the facility. The Task Force asks that the general public and members of the press take special note that these labels are grossly inaccurate, misleading, and simply not true.<sup>[[54]](https://ia902209.us.archive.org/31/items/reportonuseofrad00mass/reportonuseofrad00mass.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[55]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222994/)</sup></sup>
  
- The Tuskegee experiment,1932. This has been subject to a lot of disinformation and popular myth. I'll quote at length from a 2005 Lancet Infectious Diseases article that corrects the distorted record on the episode<sup>[[56]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(05)01286-7/fulltext)</sup></sup>: "More than a quarter of black Americans questioned in a recent survey believe that AIDS was produced in a laboratory, and 16% believe that it was created by the US government to control the black population. In attempting to explain why such mistaken notions are so widely held, Laura Bogart, lead author of the study, says: “Conspiracy beliefs stem from current and historical discrimination against blacks in our health-care system, including the Tuskegee syphilis study”. The Tuskegee study has become the archetype of unethical research and racism in medicine. However, by citing Tuskegee, is Bogart merely invoking one set of conspiracy beliefs to explain another? Between 1932 and 1972, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) studied 600 black men, 399 with untreated latent syphilis and 201 uninfected controls, living around Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. Although there was no study protocol, the purpose of the Tuskegee experiments seems to have been to observe patients with untreated latent syphilis to autopsy and verify the presence or absence of syphilitic destructive lesions. According to a detailed analysis of the Tuskegee study by Robert M White in Archives of Internal Medicine, USPHS officers believed that the study “should forever dispel the rather general belief that syphilis is a disease of small consequence to the negro”. Many aspects of the conduct of the Tuskegee study are beyond dispute. The men who took part were not told their diagnosis and were misled into believing they were receiving treatment, when in fact most were never adequately treated, even when penicillin became available. However, a pervasive myth that must be dispelled is that patients were deliberately infected with syphilis. The truth is that the infected men had had syphilis for several years at the time they were recruited. It is debatable whether the study was racist. All the patients and controls were black (as was 82% of the population of Macon County in 1930), but this was because the study has its origins in earlier work supported by the philanthropic Rosenwald Fund, with the motivation of promoting the welfare of African Americans. Although the Rosenwald Fund decided not to support the Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis, it was endorsed by the Tuskegee Institute—an entirely African-American organisation—and black health-care professionals were involved at all stages of the study. Indeed, as late as 1969, the Macon County Medical Society, consisting mostly of black doctors, agreed to assist the USPHS in continuing the study.

    To describe the Tuskegee study as unethical requires an element of what Richard A Shweder describes as “presentism” (ie, judging past actions on the basis of the standards of today). When the study began, the only treatment for syphilis was the poorly efficacious arsphenamine compounds, and there was no medical consensus on the usefulness of these drugs in latent syphilis. And debate over whether treatment of latent syphilis did more harm than good continued into the early 1950s, well into the era of penicillin availability. We should also bear in mind that in the 1930s there were no written standards for experimentation with human beings, and the paternalistic attitude that pervaded medical practice at the time meant that the norms for informing patients about their illness were very different from now. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that a hypothetical institutional review board of the 1930s would have judged the Tuskegee study unethical at its inception. However, principles for research with human beings were adopted by the American Medical Association in 1946, and by the 1950s programmes for penicillin treatment of syphilis were widespread across the USA. Thus, by its 20th anniversary the Tuskegee study had become unethical by the standards of the time—patients should have been informed of their diagnosis and given the option of treatment. To use the “Tuskegee effect” to explain the disengagement by many black Americans with the reality of AIDS is perhaps understandable, given the way the study has been popularly interpreted. However, focus-group research shows that the public is able to weigh current concerns against worries about the Tuskegee study. The Tuskegee experiment deserves re-examination, free of our contemporary prejudices, before it is again deployed as a symbol of conspiracy."<sup>[[57]](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/224795)</sup></sup> <sup>[[58]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568733/pdf/jnma00185-0122.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[59]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043659608314196)</sup></sup>

- Between 1974 and 75, it was alleged that the US Indian Health Service engaged in a forced sterilization effort against the natives without their consent. However, an independent 1976 GAO investigation found this allegation baseless. Concluding: "We found no evidence that IHS sterilising Indians without a patient consent form on file, although we did find several weaknesses in complying with HEW's sterilization regulations. The primary weaknesses related to (1) sterilization of persons under 21 years of age, (2) inadequately documenting what the Indian subjects were told before singing the consent form (largely attributable to the the use of consent forms that failed to meet HEW standards), (3) lack of widespread physician understanding of the regulations, and (4) the lack of definitive requirements for informed consent when sterilizations are performed by contract doctors at contract facilities."<sup>[[1]](https://www.gao.gov/assets/hrd-77-3.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists claim that the FBI/local Police assassinated Fred Hampton.
On November 1969, black panther extremists shot and killed two police officers and wounding several more. The FBI obtained information that the extremist group had a stockpile of various items at 2337 West Monroe Street, Chicago.  5 carbines with 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 gas masks, 3 smoke bombs, 5 Ithaca riot shotguns plus ammunition, 4-38 caliber handguns plus ammunition and one .357 magnum plus ammunition. Additional information came in that there included illegal weapons and stolen Police weapons. The Police/FBI had no knowledge that Hampton was present. A Grand Jury investigation, which examined all investigations, autopsies, toxicology reports, and testimony found that the assassination theory to be without merit: The autopsy conducted by Dr. Petty at the Shreveport Louisiana Veterans Hospital, with Grand Jury attorneys present, was extraordinarily thorough. An X-ray study of the entire body was made, and color and black and white photographs were taken at every stage of the examination. This autopsy conclusively confirmed the findings of the FBI and the coroner's chemist that there was no trace of drugs in the body through extensive cultural analyses of the stomach, kidneys, liver, brain and other organs; samples of these organs were contemporaneously obtained by the Hampton family pathologist and the coroner's pathologists." This report finds that the justification for the search warrant was narrow and not politically motivated. This Earth-shattering report also refutes the family and Panther "investigations," by pointing out their bias, "The Black Panther Party investigation also included the retention of a private pathologist who on December 5, 1969, performed a second autopsy on the body of Fred Hampton. Again, before beginning his work, this pathologist was briefed as to the defense theory that Hampton was intentionally murdered... One of the significant impressions the Grand Jury obtained from parts of the investigation conducted by the survivors' attorneys—and, indeed, from parts of the official investigation as well-was the extent to which the predisposition of the individuals conducting the investigations affects the result. Any investigation that is designed to prove a theory rather than establish the facts has to be thoughtfully scrutinized and should not be accepted as objective without such scrutiny...This mistake combined with the mistaken drug analysis, the erroneous classification of the shoulder wound as a graze, the confusion over the recovery of a bullet by the coroner and the defense counsels' predilection for accusatory press conferences, contributed significantly to exacerbating community tension. Plainly, a careful and objective approach to the second autopsy could have prevented this unnecessary conflict over the cause of death." The report also examines the FBI and other forensic studies of the scene, and finds that while on other matters, the Officer's testimony are corroborated by evidence, on ballistics—it does not. It is confirmed that the occupants fired the first shot from the shotgun, there was confusion among the officers in the dark apartment, leading them to conclude that the shots fired from other officers in response to the shotgun were coming from the panthers. It was determined that only one shot, the shotgun, was fired from the panthers. These findings are what caused the Government to conclude the indictments be dismissed against the remaining survivors in the interest of justice. It should be noted, as the report finds: These survivors could have provided valuable insight into what happened, however, they refused to testify.<sup>[[1]](https://ia601200.us.archive.org/18/items/Grand-Jury-Fred-Hampton-1970/Hampton.-1970-FGJ-Report.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1968, Martin Luther King (MLK) Jr was assassinated by James Earl Ray. Some allege that the FBI or CIA were involved in his death. HSCA investigated allegations that the Government (Federal, State and local), were involved in MLK's assassination. HSCA concluded none of the proffered evidence supported the claim, "No Federal, State or Local Government Agency was Involved in the Assassination of Dr. King."<sup>[[1]](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-1)</sup></sup> HSCA also independently confirms the DOJ's 1977 Task Force report on FBI's interactions with MLK. "The Task Force concluded, however, that the evidence was overwhelming that Ray was a lone assassin, and it found no evidence of FBI involvement."<sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081247391&view=2up&seq=1)</sup></sup>

  Conspiracy theorists repeat the mantra that, "the government was found guilty, being responsible for the assassination of MLK!" However, this was in a civil case—where the standard of evidence is far, far lower. Nonetheless, as a result, another independent investigation was ordered to examine all the evidence in the civil case—what followed was a landmark refutation. "We found no reliable evidence to support Jowers' allegations that he conspired with others to shoot Dr. King from behind Jim's Grill. In fact, credible evidence contradicting his allegations, as well as material inconsistencies among his accounts and his own repudiations of them, demonstrate that Jowers has not been truthful. Rather, it appears that Jowers contrived and promoted a sensational story of a plot to kill Dr. King.

  Likewise, we do not credit Donald Wilson's claim that he took papers from Ray's abandoned car. Wilson has made significant contradictory statements and otherwise behaved in a duplicitous manner, inconsistent with his professed interest in seeking the truth. Important evidence contradicting Wilson's claims, including the failure of James Earl Ray to support Wilson's revelation, further undermines his account. Although we were unable to determine the true origin of the Wilson documents, his inconsistent statements, his conduct, and substantial evidence refuting his claims all demonstrate that his implausible account is not worthy of belief. Accordingly, we have concluded that the documents do not constitute evidence relevant to the King assassination. The weight of the evidence available to our investigation also establishes that Raoul is merely the creation of James Earl Ray. We found no evidence to support the claims that a Raoul participated in the assassination. Rather, a review of 30 years of speculation about his identity presents a convincing case that no Raoul was involved in a conspiracy to kill Dr. King. Finally, while we conducted no original investigation specifically directed at determining whether James Earl Ray killed Dr. King, we found no credible evidence to disturb past judicial determinations that he did."<sup>[[3]](https://www.justice.gov/crt/united-states-department-justice-investigation-allegations-regarding-assassination-dr-martin)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/government-mlk-assassination/)</sup></sup> <sup>[[5]](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/17/instagram-posts/fact-checking-old-conspiracy-about-martin-luther-k/)</sup></sup>

- It is alleged by conspiracy theorists that between 1967 and 1974, Operation CHAOS, a CIA foreign intelligence program, was actually a domestic spy program aimed at disrupting First Amendment activities of US citizens. However, the declassified records contradict this claim outright. "CHAOS was a foreign intelligence collection program, aimed at assessing foreign intelligence interference in the dissident movements. A handful of officers incidentally did end up acquiring such information while they were in the United States bolstering their dissident credentials. There is no indication, however, that anyone connected to Operation CHAOS utilized clandestine means, such as electronic surveillance, wiretaps, or break-ins, to acquire any of this information. When then CIA Director Richard Helms informed President Johnson that the Agency could not spy on Americans, President Johnson stated: 'I'm quite aware of that. What I want for you is to pursue this matter, and to do what is necessary to track down the foreign communists who are behind this intolerable interference in our domestic affairs.' It appears that the Agency did just that-focusing not on the domestic facets of the movement, but rather on the connection of foreign entities to it. As the Rockefeller Commission found the program to be lawful, "the subject matter of the information and not the location of its source is the principal factor that determines whether it is within the purview of the CIA. As one scholar finds, in his careful, thorough, and incisive study reveals: "Applying this to Operation CHAOS under the Act as it existed in 1973, most of the activities undertaken by the Agency were entirely legal. The stated purpose of the Agency's activities in tracking dissident movements was to determine the foreign influences, if any, on those movement. Thus, the purpose was not to collect domestic information, nor to collect information for the purpose of prosecution (i.e., law enforcement), but rather for foreign intelligence purposes. The collection therefore fell within the confines of the Act and was entirely permissible. The Rockefeller Commission came to the same conclusion."<sup>[[1]](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj#page=48)</sup></sup>

- In 1967, Soviet disinformation outlet, Il Paese Sera, claimed that it was the CIA that was behind the assassination of JFK. This classic case of Russian fake news has been refuted by several Congressional investigations, the DOJ, FBI and outside forensic experts.<sup>[[1]](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Lie-That-Linked-CIA-to-the-Kennedy-Zelikow-Holland/1ba2b788218120e9e205ae7d9bb1877cdb3cb405)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://theconversation.com/jfk-conspiracy-theory-is-debunked-in-mexico-57-years-after-kennedy-assassination-148138)</sup></sup> The Warren Commission and HSCA both concluded no involvement on behalf of the US Government agencies, Cubans or Soviet Union, "Based on the committee's entire investigation, it concluded that the Secret Service, FBI and CIA were not involved in the assassination. The committee concluded that it is probable that the President was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. Nothing in the committee's investigation pointed to official involvement in that conspiracy. While the committee frankly acknowledged that its investigation was not able to identify the members of the conspiracy besides Oswald, or the extent of the conspiracy, the committee believed that it did not include the Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, or Central Intelligence Agency."<sup>[[3]](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-1)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://ia800705.us.archive.org/30/items/COUNTERINGCRITICISMOFTHEWARRENREPORT/COUNTERING%20CRITICISM%20OF%20THE%20WARREN%20REPORT.pdf)</sup></sup> However, yes, the HSCA believed there was evidence of a second shooter.<sup>[[5]](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1c.html)</sup></sup> This was concluded based on flawed acoustic analysis. The National Academy of Sciences independently refuted this finding.<sup>[[6]](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10264/chapter/2)</sup></sup> However, the NAS report suffered few minor issues. Subsequently, a landmark study from 2005 corrected those issues from the NRC report, and its findings ultimately supported it. "Our present studies not only affirm the NRC Panel's conclusion but make an even stronger case by: correcting errors; removing the two objective criticisms to the HOLD crosstalk (i.e., those based on the dispatcher's time annotations and on the timing incompatibility of a HOLD crosstalk with a putative CHECK crosstalk); and showing that the analyses of Channel 2 based on the FBI copy (Track 7) agree with those based on the Bowles copy (Tracks 2 and 3), provided that the proper time correction factors K obtained using AC hum and spectrographic pattern cross-correlation are applied. We affirm the NRC conclusion "that the impulses attributed to gunshots were recorded about one minute after the President had been shot and the motorcade had been instructed to go to the hospital. We also show that if, instead, the HOLD synchronization is ignored and the "YOU . . . Stemmons" synchronization is used, the first sounds alleged to be from shots occur at least 30 s after the assassination. Most fundamentally, as emphasized in the NRC report, once one has established "Hold everything secure . . ." as a valid crosstalk in its proper position (no "overdub" involving a skipback on the Channel 1 recording), then no further timing analysis is needed to show that the impulses were not the assassination shots, because they overlap in time with "Hold . . . ,"which by its meaning could only have been uttered after the assassination was recognized."<sup>[[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1355030605716683)</sup></sup>

  Did JFK say, "splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.” Most likely not. Versions of the quote goes as far back as 1819 and 1840. While the phrase comes into full in 1916 by British author John Buchan, "Make no mistake, Madam; that folly is over. I will tear this sacred garment into a thousand pieces and scatter them on the wind." The reference to CIA and JFK comes from an anonymous source in the NYT.<sup>[[8]](https://books.google.com/books?id=Iks4AQAAMAAJ&q=%22a+thousand+pieces+and+scatter%22&dq=%22a+thousand+pieces+and+scatter%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRxsyi7svSAhWJ5CYKHYcqAvU4ChDoAQg3MAY)</sup></sup> <sup>[[9]](https://books.google.com/books?id=SxwEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22Scatter+it+to+the+winds+of+heaven%22&source=bl&ots=0rth20prXe&sig=e_ee-YwteX_CQy3t1_sjU_3Z9Rc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQtOb28cvSAhWFRSYKHenjDvQ4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22Scatter%20it%20to%20the%20winds%20of%20heaven%22&f=false)</sup></sup> <sup>[[10]](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Greenmantle/Chapter_21)</sup></sup> <sup>[[11]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP75-00001R000200520008-1.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
  The other quote conspiracy theorists attribute to JFK, “There’s a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot.”  does not exist. This was never said. “We’ve been asked about this quote (and a few variations of it) many times and we’ve never found any evidence that John F. Kennedy said or wrote it,” Stacey Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, wrote in an email to the AP. Marc Selverstone, an associate professor at the University of Virginia and chair of the Presidential Recordings Program, has also seen this quote circulate many times and told the AP that he has never seen it in a reputable source.

  Chandler explained that the quote is often claimed to have come from a speech Kennedy supposedly gave at Columbia University in November 1963, either on Nov. 15 or Nov. 12. However, there is no indication Kennedy ever spoke at Columbia University on these dates or any other time in 1963, she said. Staff at the presidential library have also searched for the quote across archival documents, historical newspaper coverage and speech databases like The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “We haven’t found a match for this statement through any of these resources or via cited secondary sources,” said Chandler. John Woolley, the co-director of The American Presidency Project, told the AP that he couldn’t find evidence of the Kennedy quote in the collection, either. “In his public remarks there is nothing at all resembling this statement in the period from November 12-14,”<sup>[[12]](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-JFK-fake-quote-conspiracy-theory-672501330708)</sup></sup>

  Lastly, it should also be noted that it was JFK that botched the Bay of Pigs, not the CIA. So, no, he'd have no reason to "get rid of the Agency". Further still, he couldn't. CIA is established by law, not Executive Order.<sup>[[13]](https://archive.org/details/BayOfPigsVolumeIVTheTaylorCommitteeInvestigationOfTheBayOfPigs)</sup></sup> <sup>[[14]](https://archive.org/details/cia-bay-of-pigs-v )</sup></sup> <sup>[[15]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201119135647/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000129913.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- Between 1956 and 1971, the FBI conducted a series of lawful activities, under COINTELPRO—in response to Congressional and public demand for stronger response, to counter and disrupt white supremacist hate groups (such as the KKK), black and far left extremist groups, who were engaged in violent activity aimed against the government, including: bombings, kidnappings, arson and murder. It also countered foreign intelligence services operating in the US, using these groups that declared publicly to, "bring the government to is knees."
It was not a domestic spy operation aimed at political dissidents, as historical revisionists claim. Only a handful of isolated incidents exceeded the FBI's mandate. Care was taken to maintain respect for the First Amendment throughout all activities.<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/cointelproreport-1)</sup></sup>  

- Some political pundits allege that CIA's first "interrogation manual" condoned torture. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Even as far back as 1958, a Studies in Intelligence article emphasised that  "torture must not be used, the article said, not only for moral and legal reasons but because it risks producing bad information and rendering the subject unfit for further use." It did suggest that “intensive” interrogation occasion ally was needed, a “softening up process" intended to "break" the detainee’s will, but not by crossing the line into physical abuse or torture. “The recalcitrant subject of an intelligence interrogation must be ‘broken,’ but broken for use like a riding horse, not smashed in the search for a single golden egg." A late 60s Studies in Intelligence article reflects a similar warning, that violence "often gets crude results quickly" because it “lowers the moral caliber of the organization employing it and soon corrupts the interrogation staff." As noted by Historian Nicholas Dujmovic, "The evidence suggests CIA took this admonition against physical abuse seriously." Since "in 1960, a CIA employee beat a Soviet bloc defector undergoing interrogation, and DCI Allen Dulles summarily dismissed him." He further observes that, "When coercive methods needed to be used, the strictest control was the norm." The alleged evidence by historical revisionists, that the CIA condoned torture is the 1963 "Kubark manual", which was more akin to an "academic discussion" of the pros and cons of various interrogation methods—landing on the side against torture. In it, "Most of the discussion concerns psychological stresses, such as the arrest itself, with only a short general discussion on the infliction of pain that emphasizes its potential to be counterproductive. Most interesting is the warning that no CIA interrogator can unilaterally use any form of coercion and that prior approval mu t be obtained from the CIA director." As Dujmovic finds, "Agency experience regarding interrogation goes back more than 50 years, and that record makes clear two things: first, that coercive methods have always been considered effective to some degree; second, that they have to be used carefully and not devolve into torture."<sup>[[1]](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/cia%20and%20interrogations-to%5B15490493%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/static/5e897e8297cc9446cc7a884703bcf6ef/Review-The-Good-Shepherd.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Other revisionists contend that the CIA tortured and drugged Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko. However, this never happened. He was subject to bare minimum living conditions—such as denied basic comforts and isolated—but never physically abused or drugged. They also point to the 1983  Human Resource Exploitation (HRE) manual as evidence of CIA's involvement in torture—yet, just like the works before it—explicitly prohibit and call to attention the negative impact of torture and abuse, on the very first page.<sup>[[3]](https://ia802905.us.archive.org/21/items/CIAHumanResourceExploitationManual_201702/CIA%20Human%20Resource%20Exploitation%20Manual.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1953 to 1973, the CIA with the United States Postal Service (USPS), operated a mail program to "give United States intelligence agencies insight into Soviet intelligence activities and interests." This took place primarily in New York. While some point to the Rockefeller Commission as suggesting this program was unlawful, a renowned scholar notes, "A more extensive analysis of the program, however, indicates that the mail cover portion of the program was legal throughout its duration, while the mail opening portion was legal during its peak years, and may have been since its inception." After a detailed examination, concludes, Thus, it would appear that the CIA's mail cover program was legal during its operation. It did not violate any criminal or civil statute, constitutional provision, or the National Security Act. In addition, contrary to the unspecified claims made by the Rockefeller Commission, the CIA's mail cover operation did not violate postal service regulations." These findings were independently concluded in a 1977 DOJ review.<sup>[[1]](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj#page=31)</sup></sup> <sup>[[2]](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3540126/CIA-RDP04M01816R000502010009-4-Compressed.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Historical revisionists claim that the CIA created and influenced American political groups, such as the Congress for Cultural Freedom and National Student Association between 1949 and 1967. This also ignores the fact that it was the Soviets who first used art and literature, and orginisations of KGB-control and making, to push disinformation. The US merely countered with truth. A ground-breaking, never-before-seen incisive study exposes this fraudulent communist narrative. The US merely funded, but did not influence the free intellectual thought and debate. Unlike the Soviet's use of such groups, US groups included diverse opinions of free-thought, even promoting anti-American narratives. Stalin's recourse to political subversion as his primary weapon against the Marshall Plan in Western Europe placed new emphasis on the international front groups the Soviets had been building since 1945. In late 1948, Moscow began stepping up its efforts to capitalize on the popular dread of another terrible war. German diplomat Gustav Hilger, who had been one of Hitler's foremost Soviet experts, explained to an internal CIA audience that Moscow sought to convince people "that the maintenance of world peace depends solely on the further attitude of the Western Powers because the Soviet Union had sufficiently proved that it wants peace." Beginning in Wroclaw, Poland, in September 1948, Soviet agents built their campaign to influence Western opinion around a series of international "cultural" conferences designed to provide stages for Communist-inspired pronouncements calling for world peace and condemning the Truman administration's increasingly confrontational policies. Conferences scheduled for Mexico City, New York. and Paris aimed at convincing Western artists, writers, and scholars that Moscow was the last hope for world peace.

  The "peace offensive" came to the United States in March 1949 with the opening of the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Conference organizers copied the fonnat of the Comintem-inspired congresses of writers and artists of the 1930s, attracting a panoply of American writers and artists, including Lillian Hellman, Aaron Copland, and Arthur Miller. The delegates joined with European and Soviet delegates to repudiate "U.S. war-mongering." Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, for example, told the delegates that "a small clique of hatemongers" was preparing a global conflagration, and he urged progressive artists to struggle against the new "Fascists" who were seeking world domination. Shostakovich, who had recently penned an ode to Stalin's forestry program, also described for his 800 listeners "the unheard-of scope and level of development reached by musical culture in the USSR." American panelists echoed the Russian composer's fear of a new global conflict Playwright Clifford Odets, for example, denounced the "enemies of Man" and claimed that fraudulent reports of Soviet aggression had whipped the United States into "a state of holy terror." Composer Aaron Copland declared "the present policies of the American Government will lead inevitably into a third world war." American Presidents from Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson approved CIA programs to shore up and strengthen private anti-Communist US organizations.

  On the Congress for Cultural Freedom, "Silone was subtler, urging the West to promote social and political reforms to co-opt Communism's still-influential moral appeal. Silone's ideas echoed the strategy that OPC adopted to guide its operations. Instead of backing the political right in Europe and Asia, OPC would back the "non-Communist left" as the must reliable bulwark against Communism. Silone and other thinkers of the non-Communist left suggested that only socialism or social democracy could lend the West the vision and the legitimacy to attain peace and prosperity-and thus dry up the sources of Communism's popular support. Whatever their misgivings about socialism, OPC officers conceded the strategic acumen of this thought. The competing ideas of Koestler and Silone lent a certain dramatic tension to the Congress, but their rivalry by itself confirmed that debate in the West was truly free, with room for all shades of anti-totalitarian opinion.

  The accomplishments of both the Congress and the QKOPERA project must be credited in no small part to one man-Michael Josselson. The project's forays into American politics-its use of prominent Americans as unwilling spokesmen and agents, as well as CCFs subsidi­zation of criticism of US policies—are also attributed to Josselson. From the early 1950s onward, Headquarters trusted Josselson and followed his lead when it came to balancing the project's anti-Communist mission against the need to maintain credibility among foreign intellectuals who were sometimes critical of the United States.

  Josselson insisted from the start that the Congress's credibility with the non-Communist left depended on its willingness to criticize American foreign and domestic policies. This belief was evidently heartfelt Josselson himself was a man of the non-Communist left, occasionally voicing strong opinions about American political develop­ments. He viewed with horror the growing conservative intellectual movement, and he privately denounced William F. Buckley's magazine National Review. He later doubted the wisdom of America's deepening involvement in Vietnam and commended Senator George McGovern's criticism of Johnson administration policies there.''" With Josselson in charge, the Congressional secretariat did not hesitate to criticize injustice in the United States. For instance, in the wake or civil rights protests at the University of Alabama, a CCF committee cabled anti-segregation messages to the state governor and In the university president. The Con­gress also petitioned California Governor Pat Brown for clemency in the widely publicized case of Caryl Chessman. Michael Josselson had powerful friends who agreed with him that America had to be self-critical in its struggle against Communism. 

  On the NSA, "The CIA rarely intervened in NSA's debates over political issues, participating only on the margins when Agency officers feared the Association could split apart in political disputes or fall into the hands of extremists (of either the left or the right) who would fritter away the goodwill and influence that NSA had painstakingly acquired among foreign student leaders. Over the years CIA case officers contended with three major developments that threatened the political balance that NSA tried to maintain: the civil rights struggle, the rise of conservatism as a political movement, and the Vietnam War. In the end, "Thus OPC applied itself to the task of subsidizing and assisting the activities of these people, hoping they might gain influence and followings in their respective circles. No coercion was involved or necessary; OPC simply ensured that funds would be available to finance certain forms of anti-Communist activism and organizing by the right sorts of Americans."<sup>[[1]](https://archive.org/details/h-m_20230806)</sup> <sup>[[2]](https://www.cia.gov/static/4b453cae3b528c19248e6a4cf4a65616/origins-congress-cultural-freedom.pdf)</sup>

- In 1942, after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbour, the US evacuated, from the West Coast, individuals of Japanese descent to temporary assembly centers. This was based on, at the time, military necessity as intelligence was indicating the existence of hundreds of Japanese organizations in California, Washington, Oregon and Arizona which, prior to December 7, 1941, were actively engaged in advancing Japanese war aims. These records also disclosed that thousands of American-born Japanese had gone to Japan to receive their education and indoctrination there and had become pro-Japanese and then had returned to the United States. That's the context for this decision. It has been rightly criticised if going to such lengths were indeed militarily necessary. However, a number of myths persist to this day, to suggest the US lacked care for Japanese people during planning, evacuation and at the new locations. This couldn't be further from the truth. Operations were designed to mitigate impact to their lives—such as sustainment and protection of property, farmland and more.<sup>[[1]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=16&skin=2021&size=125)</sup></sup> Exceptional, adequate medical and sanitation care was provided during transfer, and at relocation facilities.<sup>[[2]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=223&skin=2021)</sup></sup> It's also worth noting that citizens with heritage from Axis nations were also considered, such as German. Of course, Japanese citizens also joined the US military to join the war effort to fight the Japanese imperialism. Their bravery and value were well noted and documented at the time, and still to this day, even during internment.<sup>[[3]](https://history.army.mil/html/books/nisei_linguists/CMH_70-99-1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[[4]](https://history.army.mil/armyhistory/AH59newOCR.pdf)</sup></sup> There is a wealth of academic scholarship on the decision to evacuate.<sup>[[5]](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112041523397&view=2up&seq=1&skin=2021)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the CIA, from 1948 onwards, had an operation called, "mockingbird" as an operation to manipulate media domestically. This is a hoax. As confirmed in the CIA's 'Family Jewels', all Mockingbird was, was a wiretap on two journalists for a few months as they were suspected of making public some classified information. "During the period from 12 March 1963 to 15 June 1963, this office installed telephone taps on two Washington-based newsmen who were suspected of disclosing classified information..."<sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101104822/https://www.cia.gov/open/Family%20Jewels.pdf)</sup></sup> This activity was also lawful at the time, and would be today.<sup>[[2]](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj)</sup></sup> Some people, however, have confused and allege that the Church Committee report confirmed this domestic influence operation was real. It did not. It discusses CIA's relationship with about 50 US individuals in media, to collect foreign intelligence, as well as creation of articles to be used at foreign populations, not the US. "They are part of a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence foreign opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of foreign newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets. The CIA has been particularly sensitive to the charge that CIA covert relationships with the American media jeopardise the credibility of the American press and risk the possibility  of  propagandising the U.S. public. Former Director William Colby expressed  this concern: 'We have taken particular caution to ensure that our operations are focused abroad and not at the United States in order to influence the opinion of the American people about  things from a CIA point of view.'"<sup>[[3]](https://archive.org/details/finalreportofsel01unit/page/192/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  
- Conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists claim that the US ignored intelligence, and covered-up Pearl harbor. However, all investigations into the matter yield no such conclusion.<sup>[[1]](https://www.nsa.gov/History/Cryptologic-History/Historical-Events/#pearl-harbor-review)</sup></sup>
