# Fact-checking and debunking the list of alleged atrocities committed by the United States
[The Bullshit asymmetry principle, or Brandolini's law](https://www.nature.com/articles/540171a):
> The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

The purpose of this meticulously documented resource project is to provide a 'living document' that officially fact-checks and outright refutes allegations made by political pundits and conspiracy theorists (from across the political spectrum), that various US foreign and domestic policy actions were 'atrocities'. This correction and refutation is achieved via a close examination of primary source records—as well as peer-reviewed, scholarly literature from world-leading experts in their corresponding fields. The issue with lists that claim to archive US "atrocities" is that they're created often by conspiracy theorists,<sup>[1](https://imgur.com/a/ipTt002)</sup></sup> who predominantly cite sensational headlines that are written by layman who either have strong biases, or simply lack familiarity with the subject matter to understand nuance and key information that'd be adverse to their conclusion. They simply do not stand up to rudimentary factual or legal scrutiny.

Some readers who will find this Repository clash with what they think they know to be true, and as a result, may commit a number of fallacies in order to dismiss the content herein—the most prominent would be the genetic fallacy. To that, you should ask yourself the following: "If the documentary record supported my position, would I cite it?" The answer is always 'yes'. When examining primary source records, one must note that they're not all equal. Raw intel cables from a Station or an embassy, for example, should not be valued in the same light as finalised intelligence products. For Congressional reports, keep in mind any disagreement between the majority & minority sections. The same applies for Agency/Department Inspectors General reports: Read management comments for a fuller understanding—Accountability Review Boards should also be examined if they disagree. Yes, this means some reports can get it wrong, as shown in some cases herein. 

__Disclaimer:__ This project isn't an attempt to whitewash or deny when actual atrocities, or wrong-doing by the US Government, has occurred. One can simply look at racial segregation, slavery, or the early treatment of natives, as some examples (hence not covered here). However, by and large, the US has maintained a very good track record on human rights. When it falters, accountability swiftly follows.

_Definition: An extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury._

_[Legal Definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20200825130159/https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.49_Framework%20of%20Analysis%20for%20Atrocity%20Crimes_EN.pdf): The  term  “atrocity  crimes”  refers  to  three  legally  defined  international  crimes:    genocide, crimes against  humanity  and  war  crimes._ 

[Per the ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/Publications/understanding-the-icc.pdf), "The International Criminal Court is _not a substitute_ for national courts. According to the Rome Statute, it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes. The International Criminal Court _can only intervene where a State is unable or unwilling genuinely to carry out the investigation and prosecute the perpetrators"_

> "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." 
 
   – President Barack  Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016

- On July 12, 2021, the Biden Administration issued its [report](https://www.state.gov/2021-report-to-congress-pursuant-to-section-5-of-the-elie-wiesel-genocide-and-atrocities-prevention-act-of-2018) to Congress Pursuant to Section 5 of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-441). "The Biden Administration is committed to promoting democratic values that underpin a stable international system critical to freedom, prosperity, and peace.  This Administration will defend and protect human rights around the world, and recognizes the prevention of atrocities is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility. This report highlights countries of concern and whole-of-government efforts undertaken by the Atrocity Early Warning Task Force to prevent and respond to atrocities."

- In 2016 and 2015, then-CIA Director John Brennan confirmed CIA's direct role in applying pressure to foreign Governments and individuals to abide by human rights, otherwise face consequences such as termination of cooperation. He confirmed that the CIA has followed through on its word, due to CIA's concerns.<sup>[1](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160713_cia_brennan_transcript.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/150806%20DCIA%20Brennan%20letter%20to%20Wyden[2].pdf)</sup></sup> This is in line with decades of CIA practice (see Western Hemisphere section).

## Alleged Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries.
This is misleading and in factual error.
  - Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present.
  - Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities.  An installation may consist of one or more sites.  

    The DoD has presence in only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sits as of [2018.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf) This is at the full [consent of host countries.](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)
  
- US Military presence abroad is popular among locals of host countries, where economies and stability increase.<sup>[1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/outside-the-wire-us-military-deployments-and-public-opinion-in-host-states/BEC8A7BA48C9CF5B82B100CCC4CFA56E)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR518.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X17738219?ai=1gvoi&mi=3ricys&af=R)</sup></sup> 
- A comprehensive [examination](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002714560350) of 164 countries for the years 1981 to 2005 concludes, "the United States is likely to engage in military campaigns for humanitarian reasons that focus on human rights protection rather than for its own security interests such as democracy promotion or terrorism reduction... The present research finds that, beneath the greater consciousness concerning promotion of democracy and combating terrorism, human rights abuses emerge as the consistent trait among states that experience US military intervention... The empirical evidence of this study leads us to believe that the United States has a sustained interest in promoting human rights abroad rather than exclusively pursuing its security interests."

- "Over the past two years, I interviewed more than 130 officials about the century-long history of covert electoral interference, or concealed foreign efforts to manipulate democratic votes of succession. My interviewees included eight former CIA directors and many more CIA officers, as well as directors of national intelligence, secretaries of state, national security advisers, a KGB general, and a former U.S. president. I learned that in the twenty-first century, Washington’s senior-most national security officials have considered using the CIA to interfere in foreign elections at least twice. In one instance—in Serbia in 2000—debate turned into action, as the CIA spent millions of dollars working against the tyrant Slobodan Milosevic. In the other—in Iraq in 2005—the CIA stood down. In both instances, U.S. policymakers weighed the potential benefits of covert action against the perceived risks. These behind-the-scenes stories reveal why, contrary to Putin’s claims, Washington, unlike Moscow, has moved away from the practice of covert electoral interference." <sup>[1](https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/20/rigged-details-long-history-russian-and-us-electoral-interference)</sup></sup>

- Congress has in fact often authorized hostilities by legislative measures other than formal “declarations of war” since the days of the early republic, and many after the War Powers Resolution.<sup>[1](https://www.justice.gov/file/19306/download)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/WCPD-1999-03-29/pdf/WCPD-1999-03-29-Pg527.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Middle East

- It has been alleged that the US sanctions medicine, among other humanitarian aid, to Iran—however, America has never sanctioned humanitarian aid, ever.<sup>[1](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/iran-sanctions)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.state.gov/iran-sanctions/)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=RS20871)</sup></sup>

- Afghan intelligence units, referred to as "zero units," with alleged connections to the CIA, have been target of a massive, "systematic disinformation campaign designed to discredit them because of the threat they posed to Taliban rule.” As noted above, CIA has a "direct role in applying pressure to foreign Governments and individuals to abide by human rights, otherwise face consequences such as termination of cooperation." And that, "the CIA has followed through on its word, due to CIA's concerns."<sup>[1](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20160713_cia_brennan_transcript.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/150806%20DCIA%20Brennan%20letter%20to%20Wyden[2].pdf)</sup></sup>

- On Sept. 29 2022, the Department of Defense reported 12 civilian deaths and approximately five civilian injuries in its Annual Report on Civilian Casualties in Connection With United States Military Operations for 2021. Deaths and injuries from Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq and Syria, Operation Freedom’s Sentinel in Afghanistan, and U.S. Africa Command activity in Somalia. Civilian deaths in Afghanistan comprised the entirety of reported deaths for 2021, amounting to 12 killed and two injured, while the department reported no deaths and three injuries in Somalia. According to the report, there were no deaths or injuries in connection with U.S. military operations in Iraq or Syria, though it did update its estimate for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to include an additional 18 injured and 10 killed as a part of the Combined Joint Task Force OIR—an operation meant to counteract activities of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in Iraq and Syria.<sup>[1](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/27/2003086234/-1/-1/1/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2021.PDF)</sup></sup>

- On the 1st of August, 2022, the US carried out a [successful drone strike](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3114362/us-drone-strike-kills-al-qaida-leader-in-kabul/) against Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan. There were 0 civilian casualties as a result.

- On February 3rd, 2022, US troops conducted a raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. Civilians were killed as a result of him detonating a bomb, killing his family. US Special forces had tried to call for his surrender and offered him a path to survive.<sup>[1](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/News-Article-View/Article/2927256/mckenzie-says-isis-leader-who-died-during-us-raid-was-evil/)</sup></sup> 
- On December 18, 2021, NYT released [hundreds](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/civilian-casualty-files.html) of CIVCAS reports obtained through FOIA. Despite media coverage, a close examination of the files reveals nothing new, broadly. But does offer superior information into specific strikes media/NGOs either covered (or didn't). The core conclusions are reached upon a thorough review of the files:
  - Most CIVCAS allegations were self-reported, long before or even with no media coverage.
  - Vast majority of CIVCAS allegations coming from media/NGOs were off be a large order of magnitude, in: Dates, locations, and assessed number of people killed/injured, and causes. Most had no CIVCAS, buttressing official statements. 
  - Confirms findings in CIVCAS reviews that SOPs, doctrine, policy, and laws (domestic & international), etc were followed in both dynamic and deliberate strikes. From strike authority to CIVCAS mitigation efforts.

  Counter to media allegations, the July 19, 2016 airstrike in Tokhar, a village in Manbij, Syria did not cause the deaths of 80 to 160 civilians. While the exact number is indeterminate, pre-strike footage confirms possibly 7 to 24 civilians. All ROEs and IHL were adhered. Nor negligence or wrong-doing. <sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20050510232110/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=7293)</sup></sup> Further, counter to the list's claim that, "The reports reveal that the US military deliberately chose to drop bombs on children they saw on camera... knowingly bombed children playing on a roof." The underlying internal document shows that children were observed the day before the strike—and that no children were seen prior to pre-strike soak of target. Only one child was wounded. Those killed were all adult ISIS. Most likely family of the child.<sup>[2](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/c-1-30-17-iraq/6747b75e76514e83/full.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  Note: Some files have been released previously under FOIA.

- On December 2, 2021, an independent Inspector General [review](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Dec/10/2002907413/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2021-084%20(REDACTED).PDF), dated May 2021, was declassified, it found CENTCOM's kinetic targeting procedures (intelligence vetting, Civilian Casualty mitigation, and approval authority) were adhered to, in operations in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Libya.

- On November 13, 2021, the New York Times ran a story that alleged there was a cover-up of a March 18, 2019 airstrike in Syria, from an F-25E—additionally, NYT alleged that over 80 civilians were killed. However, in reality, an independent panel found this airstrike resulted in only 4 civilians killed. One female and three children. 15 civilians were wounded 11 women and four children.<sup>[1](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3034995/pentagon-press-secretary-john-f-kirby-holds-a-press-briefing/)</sup></sup> The NYT article is riddled with red flags and omissions to bias in favour of sensationalism. Sadly, expert commentators were largely ignored by the media.<sup>[2](https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2021/11/15/the-law-the-baghuz-airstrike-and-accusations-of-a-possible-war-crime-and-cover-up/)</sup></sup> When the NYT reached out to CENTCOM prior to publishing, they received a full statement that undercuts NYT's entire narrative. Captain Bill Urban, US CENTCOM spokesperson, provided the same statement to to various outlets November 14, 2021, since the NYT left it out entirely: 
 
  "In mid to late March of 2019, U.S., coalition and Syrian Democratic Forces had isolated the final remnants of the ISIS proclaimed territorial caliphate in Baghouz, Syria. The ISIS pocket included thousands of fighters and family members including women and children. The remaining fighters including some women and child combatants along with many ISIS family members, including some who were likely held against their will, decided to make a determined stand in an area that included buildings, tunnels and cliffs. Multiple entreaties to ISIS to allow family members to depart the area were rebuffed, and thousands of family members remained in the area of the fighting. On March 18, 2019, five days before the end of the battle, as many as 200 ISIS fighters launched a determined counterattack on SDF and coalition forces that started around 4 a.m. local time, lasted numerous hours and resulted in more than 30 SDF casualties. After more than 6 hours of fighting and dozens of strikes, numerous U.S. manned and unmanned strike platforms had departed the area due to having expended all of their ordinance. ISIS fighters had inflicted high casualties on the SDF through small arms, rocket propelled grenades, indirect fire, improvised explosive devices and suicide bombings.

   After 10 a.m. local time, an SDF position under heavy fire and in danger of being overrun called for defensive airstrikes on ISIS fighter positions. The SDF fighters reported the area clear of civilians, and the nearest U.S. special operations forces on the ground also reported that they could observe no civilians in the area. The only remaining U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the area at the time of the strike was only capable of providing standard definition full motion video (FMV) as high definition-capable UAVs that were on station earlier had departed following the expenditure of their ordinance. The remaining U.S. UAV had also expended all of its hellfire missiles and was unarmed at the time of the call. The U.S. UAV on station was unable to discern any civilians in the area at the time of the SDF request. The only remaining armed strike aircraft on scene at the time of the request for air support was a U.S. F-15 with precision guided 500-pound bombs. With the area reported clear of civilians, and SDF positions under fire, the special operations strike cell authorized two defensive strikes on ISIS positions with two 500-pound precision guided munitions from the F-15. The strikes were determined to have taken out at least 16 active ISIS fighters that were engaged in attacks on SDF positions.

   Several hours after these two strikes, a coalition UAV operator, who was operating a coalition UAV in the area with high-definition full motion video reported to U.S. special operations forces that the UAV had observed possible civilians in the area at the time of the strike. As the U.S. strike cell was unaware of the presence of the coalition UAV, U.S. special operations forces did not have access to their feed at the time of the strike. In response to this report, U.S. special operations forces leaders initiated a civilian casualty credibility assessment which determined that the report of civilian casualties was credible and warranted a 15-6 investigation. The civilian casualty credibility assessment and the 15-6 determined through the study of all available evidence including coalition high-definition video, that several locations unobserved by the U.S. UAV with men, women, and children likely received lethal effects from the strikes. The investigations concluded that at least 4 civilians were killed and 8 were wounded from these strikes. The investigations were unable to conclusively characterise the status of more than 60 other casualties that resulted from these strikes. The reason for this uncertainty is that multiple armed women and at least one armed child were observed in the video, and the exact mixture of armed and unarmed personnel could not be conclusively determined.

   Likely, a majority of those killed were also combatants at the time of the strike, however, it is also highly likely that there were additional civilians killed by these two strikes. The 15-6 investigation concluded that these two strikes were legitimate self-defense strikes in support of SDF forces under fire, that they were proportional due to the unavailability of smaller ordinance at the time of the request, and that appropriate steps were taken to rule out the presence of civilians at the time of the strike. To prevent unintended casualties in the future, the investigation recommended requiring high-definition video for similar strikes in the future, and the requirement for the strike cell to coordinate with any coalition surveillance assets in the area at the time of the strike, and those recommendations were implemented. Finally, in accordance with the findings, the investigating officer determined that no disciplinary actions were warranted. We abhor the loss of innocent life and take all possible measures to prevent them. In this case, we self-reported and investigated the strike according to our own evidence and take full responsibility for the unintended loss of life. It is important to understand that ISIS decided to put their own families at risk when all avenues of escape were afforded to them. It is also important to note that some women and children, whether through indoctrination or choice, decided to take up arms in this battle and as such could not strictly be classified as civilians. Ultimately, the determined effort of U.S., coalition and SDF forces culminated the final territorial defeat of ISIS on March 23, 2019, but it did not come without a significant cost of U.S. and partner casualties or without the regrettable loss of civilian life."<sup>[3](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/2844585/us-central-command-statement-to-correct-the-record-from-capt-bill-urban/)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.scribd.com/document/541572278/CENTCOM-Statement-on-Baghouz-Strike#download&from_embed)</sup></sup>
  
  After the media reporting, SecDef Austin appointed a Four-Star General to review the matter. The [review](https://media.defense.gov/2022/May/17/2002999192/-1/-1/1/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-INDEPENDENT-REVIEW-OF-18-MARCH-2019-CIVILIAN-CASUALTY-INCIDENT-IN-BAGHUZ-SYRIA.PDF) consisted of 20 experts, which reviewed 124 documents, 25 reports, and 29 hours of video feed. It found that the "Ground Force Commander repeatedly received confirmation that no civilians were in the strike area" and that, "multiple efforts to distinguish civilians from ISIS were made, and the engagements were proportional... GFC acted reasonably and within the bounds of the ROE and LOW. I found clear evidence that the GFC demonstrated awareness and concern for CIVCAS and took steps to mitigate harm. My review also included information that was not available to the GFC at the time. That additional information shows that, through no fault of his own, the GFC relied on data that was not fully accurate. In accordance with the LOW, the GFC's actions cannot be judged based on what we know now in hindsight, but only on the reasonableness of his decisions given the information known at the time." It also concluded, "A secondary basis for the allegations of concealment and wrongdoing was a series of three articles published by the New York Times. A thorough analysis of all available information indicates there is no evidence to support these allegations as they relate to the strikes on 18 March 2019 examined by this review."

  It should be noted, this review confirms CENTCOM's statement that a CIVCAS allegation was made immediately following the strike. The appearance that that it wasn't taken seriously by the person who raised a complaint was due to the credibility assessment and the 15-6 investigation both missing their deadlines for completion. "the original review of the incident to determine whether the allegations of CIVCAS were credible and the AR 15-6 investigation report were both submitted after their respective deadlines. In addition, although the incident was reviewed and investigated, administrative steps to close the incident and thereby cause it to be included in reports to Congress did not occur."

- On October 22 2021, A U.S. [airstrike](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2820408/us-strike-in-the-vicinity-of-suluk-syria-oct-22-2021/) conducted by an MQ-9 drone, in northwest Syria killed senior al-Qaeda leader Abdul Hamid al-Matar. 0 civilian casualties are assessed. 
   
- On August 29, 2021, US forces conducted an airstrike in self-defense; believed to be an imminent ISIS-K threat to Hamad Karzai International airport. Immediately after the strike, CENTCOM issued a statement that acknowledged possible CIVCAS, before any local or international media reported on it, "We are assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time."<sup>[1](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2756206/us-central-command-statement-on-defensive-strike-in-kabul/)</sup></sup> A follow-up statement that same day said, "We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today... We are still assessing the results of this strike..."<sup>[2](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2756293/update-us-central-command-statement-on-defensive-strike-in-kabul/)</sup></sup> 
  
  On September 17, an independent investigation was completed. It found, "The initial compound from which the Toyota Corolla came from is a confirmed ISIS-K facility. Rocket attacks came from there, among other intel (post strike), upholding this assessment; 60 sources of intel were coming in, indicating a white Toyota Corolla would be used for an attack; 6 drones in total, over 8 hours, observed the movements; The secondary explosives reported in post-review seem to indicate propane tanks detonated to the rear of the vehicle; Weaponeering was completed to mitigate CIVCAS, such as delayed fuse, making sure no assessed civilians were near, etc. All ROEs were followed on the time-sensitive target. An initial CIVCAS review was initiated within 24 hours of the incident. This was not prompted by the NYT article.<sup>[3](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2780738/general-kenneth-f-mckenzie-jr-commander-of-us-central-command-and-pentagon-pres/)</sup></sup>
   
  These findings were largely corroborated by two larger, independent investigations. One by the Air Force Inspector General, the other by the DoD Inspector General.<sup>[4](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2831896/air-force-official-briefs-media-on-deadly-drone-strike-in-kabul/)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/b72be59f-f01e-4e3a-bdba-8582472b9c83/note/25812926-b3ca-4280-9e69-2e337a8d6a23.#page=1)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://archive.org/details/29aug21_kabul_RPAstrike/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  
- On August 27, 2021, the United States conducted a counterterrorism airstrike via drone, against the ISIS-K planner responsible for the attack on the Hamid Karzai International Airport. [0 civilian casualties](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/STATEMENTS/Statements-View/Article/2755890/us-central-command-statement-on-counterterrorism-strike-on-isis-k-planner/) resulted from this operation. 

- On June 27, 2021, President Biden, authorised US Military [defensive precision airstrikes](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2672875/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/) against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region. The targets were selected because these facilities are utilized by Iran-backed militias that are engaged in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. Specifically, the U.S. strikes targeted operational and weapons storage facilities. These strikes were legal under US domestic and international law. 0 civilians were killed.

- On June 3, 2021, the US Department of Defense released its [annual](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jun/02/2002732834/-1/-1/0/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2020.PDF) civilian casualty report pursuant to Section 1057 of the 2018 NDAA, as amended.
 The report covers Calendar Year 2020 for Global Military operations. It assesses that in 2020, US Military operations resulted in 23 civilians killed and 10 injured. The report also updated the Department's previous casualty numbers from prior years. The DoD assessment is based off of all NGO, media, and foreign Government submissions, self-reporting, etc. Its methodology is superior to that of NGOs, as it relies on classified and sensitive methods to determine casualties, including footage before, during, and after each incident. The Department is also transparent in updating prior reporting to increase the numbers, should new credible information be discovered. The new report details the near completion of two independent studies required by Congress. 

- On May 1st, 2021, the Biden Administration declassified an [11-page document](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-psp-drone-strike-rules-foia/52f4a4baf5fc54c5/full.pdf) created under the Trump admin, that superseded Obama's policy framework dubbed "the [2013 PPG](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download)" that governs Counterterrorism (CT) operations Outside Areas of Active Hostilities. Like the Obama guidance, it keeps intact layered oversight and bureaucracy. Key takeaways from the 2017 Principles, Standards, and Procedures for US Direct Action Against Terrorist Targets, or, "PSP" for short, include:
  - >The law of armed conflict imposes important constraints on the ways in which the United States uses force abroad.
  - >Direct action will be discriminating and precise in order to avoid noncombatant casualties. The United States goes to extraordinary lengths to reduce the likelihood of noncombatant casualties in CT operations, exercising restraint as a matter of policy that often exceeds what is required by LOAC.
  - >Direct Action should be undertaken wherever practicable and consistent with US interests and applicable domestic and international law.
  - >The United States will continue to take extraordinary measures to ensure with near certainty that noncombatants will not be injured or killed in the course of operations, using all reasonably available information and means of verification.
    
   Among many more restrictions and layered oversight for target approval, and general preference for capture rather than kill missions.

- On February 25th, 2021, in his first month in Office, [President Biden approved](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/27/a-letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-and-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate-consistent-with-the-war-powers-resolution/) airstrikes on lawful infrastructure targets in eastern Syria used by Iran-supported non-state militia groups. These groups were involved in recent attacks against civilians, US and coalition personnel. 0 civilians killed or wounded.

- In [2020](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/05/2002823939/-1/-1/0/ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-IN-CONNECTION-WITH-UNITED-STATES-MILITARY-OPERATIONS-IN-2020-FINAL.PDF#page=6), US Global military operations killed only 23 civilians and injured 10.

- On January 2nd, 2020, President Donald Trump [authorised a lawful](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6776446/Section-1264-NDAA-Notice.pdf) <sup>[1](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21012045-redacted-olc-memo-justification-of-soleimani-strike)</sup></sup> air strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of the IRGC-Qods Force, a [designated terrorist organisation.](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos.html) "As a matter of International Law, the strike targeting Soleimani in Iraq was taken in United States national self-defense, as recognised in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, in response to a series of escalating armed attacks that Iran and Iran-supported militias had already conducted against the United States." For an expert deep-dive, I recommend this [read](https://www.lawfareblog.com/was-soleimani-killing-assassination) by two world-leading experts. "General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region...He had orchestrated attacks...culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and [Iraqi personnel.](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)" Soleimani is a [well-documented](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-bloody-legacy-of-qasem-soleimani-11578093506) mass-murderer. His forces are known to rape innocent women on mass and committed many crimes against humanity and war crimes.

- On October 9, 2019, United Nations Mission Afghanistan released a report claiming US forces illegally struck drug facilities, resulting in civilian casualties. This report was [discredited](https://archive.org/details/USFORA-airstrike-response) for citing Jihadi propaganda websites, its deeply flawed legal examination, etc. From the response:
  
  > "United States Forces — Afghanistan (USFOR—A) disputes the findings, legal analysis, and methodology of the UNAMA report released. USFOR—A is concerned by the way UNAMA reached its conclusions and disagrees with their mischaracterization of the Taliban in the methamphetamine production facilities; their reliance on sources with conflicted motives or limited knowledge (including the Taliban propaganda website "Voice of Jihad"); and their narrow definition of legally targetable combatants.

  > By the time USFOR—A decided to conduct precision strikes, intelligence and operations professionals knew what the Taliban narcotics production facilities looked like, exactly where they were and who was allowed entry. USFOR—A and partner organizations also knew the pattern–of–life for their operations and locales. Under US legal definitions and rules and policies governing the conduct of war, and after exhaustive and comprehensive review of the facilities and those running them, USFOR—A and partner entities determined personnel in the labs were members of the Taliban and lawful military targets.

  > USFOR—A deliberately chose the targets and the timing for the strikes to avoid non-combatant casualties, striking during the daylight hours to maximize the ability to obtain and share site pictures which ensured we could verify the absence of civilians. On the day of operations, USFOR—A observation of the targeted sites used multiple surveillance platforms, including aircraft with full-motion video gathering capabilities. USFOR—A pre-strike processes included scores of hours of scrutiny of targeted sites to ensure we could verify non-combatants were not present. USFOR—A had degrees of certainty required at the time of the precision strikes to assess forces were only striking legal targets and avoiding non-combatant casualties and collateral damage. USFOR—A even declined to strike nearly a dozen production facilities due to even a slight possibility for civilian casualties.

  > The investigations leading to the identification and characterization of these methamphetamine production facilities, their ownership and oversight by the Taliban, the internal rules allowing entry only to Taliban combatants, as well as the flow of funds from these locations to Taliban operations, were combined operations with Afghan security partners. These operations against these Taliban revenue sources were planned and developed over the course of a year, drawing upon the expertise and resources of a wide array of interagency and inter-governmental organizations and relying upon extensive intelligence collection."
 
- In September 2019, a US drone strike targeted Da'esh terrorists in Nangarha province, according to Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. [Media alleged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-drones/u-s-drone-strike-kills-30-pine-nut-farm-workers-in-afghanistan-idUSKBN1W40NW) that 30 civilian farm workers were killed in the strike. However, according to the Department of Defense annual report on civilian casualties from US global operations covering CY19, only [8 civilians were incidentally killed](https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/06/2002295555/-1/-1/1/SEC-1057-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-MAY-1-2020.PDF), not 30. Strike was in accordance with international law.

- US Navy SEAL, Eddie Gallagher was alleged to have killed/injured innocent civilians. This [turned out](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/06/21/legal-bombshell-explodes-on-seal-war-crimes-trial/) to be a lie from his junior SEALs. Subsequently, Gallagher was [acquitted](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20476626-complete_gallagher_files_ocr) of all charges, but found guilty of one crime he never challenged: Posing for a photo with a body—something his SEAL colleagues also did, however, due to their immunities, they weren't charged.

- [On April 13, 2018](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/file/1067551/download), in coordination with the United Kingdom and France, the  United  States  attacked  three  facilities  associated  with  Syria’s  use  of  chemical weapons: the Barzeh Research and Development Center, the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons storage facility, and the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons bunker facility. There have been [many](https://dod.defense.gov/portals/1/features/2018/0418_syria/img/timeline.pdf) instances of the Syrian regime using these illegal weapons on innocent civilians, which is, of course, a war crime. [No civilians](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/1493658/briefing-by-secretarymattis-on-us-strikes-in-syria/) were killed or injured as a result of the US/UK/France attacks—as great care was taken to avoid them. Russia has [enabled]( https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/01/5_Lawless_StateofComplicity-1.pdf) the war crimes committed by the Syrian regime, and has also [committed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html) many themselves. Because Russia is allied with such a thuggish rogue state, and has committed heinous acts themselves, they must [deny](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2014/08/20/attempts-to-blame-the-syrian-opposition-for-the-august-21st-sarin-attacks-continue-one-year-on/), [lie](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/11/13/russia-accidentally-provide-best-evidence-syrian-governments-involvement-sarin-attacks/) and spin truth. Just as they did for their deliberate attack on civilian airline, [MH17](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) more than [once](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334396-2016-2017-ISC-AR.html) Russia has acted as a disinfo mill: Creating lies and spreading them far and wide. Through their proxy—wikileaks—Russia has spread fake news concerning a "whistleblower" in the OPCW via the leak of emails. That headline is enough to [convince](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md) some to believe Syria is innocent, simply because they don't want to spend the time to fact-check. Suffice to say, the disinformation has been covered, and debunked by the [OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2020/02/opcw-independent-investigation-possible-breaches-confidentiality-report), [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/15/the-opcw-douma-leaks-part-1-we-need-to-talk-about-alex/), and many others—including a sufficient skill at [reading comprehension.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/11/25/emails-and-reading-comprehension-opcw-douma-coverage-misses-crucial-facts/) To quote from the OPCW [investigation](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2021/04/opcw-releases-second-report-investigation-and-identification-team), "With respect to Inspector A, he was not a member of the FFM. As described by the investigators, Inspector A played a minor supporting role in the investigation of the Douma incident, and he did not have access to all of the information gathered by the FFM team, including witness interviews, laboratory results, and analyses by independent experts. Although Inspector A’s assessment purports to be an official OPCW FFM report on the Douma incident, it is instead a personal document created with incomplete information and without authorisation. With respect to Inspector B, after he was selected to be a member of the FFM for the first time, he travelled to Syria in April 2018. He never left the command post in Damascus because he had not completed the necessary training required to deploy on-site to Douma. Inspector B separated from the OPCW at the end of August 2018; however, he continued to approach staff members in an effort to have continued access to and influence over the Douma investigation. The majority of the FFM’s work occurred after Inspector B’s separation, and during the last seven months of the FFM’s investigation (August 2018 through February 2019). After the issuance of the interim report on Douma in July 2018, it took an additional seven months for the FFM to further investigate the incident and conduct the bulk of its work. During this period, Inspector A no longer had any supporting role regarding the FFM; Inspector B was no longer employed by the OPCW as of late August 2018. 
 
  Inspectors A and B are not whistle-blowers. They are individuals who could not accept that their views were not backed by evidence. When their views could not gain traction... Their behaviour is even more egregious as they had manifestly incomplete information about the Douma investigation. Therefore, as could be expected, their conclusions are erroneous, uninformed, and wrong."

- Starting in [June 2017](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/12/u-s-led-forces-accused-using-white-phosphorus-syria-iraq/), photos and videos from Raqqa, Syria claiming to have shown alleged US-backed groups "illegally" using white phosphorus. While it's hard to say who was deploying it—mere use of WP is not a war crime. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon told the Washington Post that the U.S. military only uses white phosphorus in “accordance with the law of armed conflict” – for example “for screening, obscuring and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures.” 
Other Coalition forces have used WP in this manner before, in other countries: Talking to NPR, New Zealand Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan said, "We have utilized white phosphorus to screen areas within west Mosul to get civilians out safely."
For an expert breakdown of the legality of WP, this [scholarly paper](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/08-2006.pdf) provides a fantastic breakdown, as does this [entry](https://www.lawfareblog.com/jus-bello-white-phosphorus-getting-law-correct) by another expert.

- A comprehensive, [independent study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048479-2018-Civilian-Casualty-Military-Study.html) from NDU, assessed US air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, between January 2015 to December 2017. The study pulled experts from Think Tanks and within the DoD, as well as establishing an NGO advisory panel. It consisted four components: 1) A literature, legal, and policy review; 2) analyses of quantitative data: strikes, civilian casualties, and US military assessments of civilian casualties; 3) semi-structured interviews with operators analysts, headquarters staff, and senior commanders, and 4) Roundtable discussions with NGOs.
  It reached four main findings:
  - Finding A.1. The delegation of Target Engagement Authority did not directly cause an increase in the rate of CIVCAS during OIR.
  - Finding A.2. There is clear written guidance and oversight regarding civilian casualty mitigation for deliberate and dynamic strikes. There is also widespread priority to minimize civilian casualties from the highest to lowest levels.
  - Finding A.3. Commanders throughout the chain of command exercised thorough oversight. These findings are consistent for declared theaters with Operating Principles that authorize direct action and Areas of Active Hostility, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Somalia, as well as Outside Areas of Active Hostility.
  - Finding A.4 The Positive Identification process has sufficient guidance and structure and therefore does not increase the risk for civilian casualties. 
    
    The review also found that US strikes rarely peaked above 5 CIVCAS over the 3 year period.
    
- On March 16 2017, in al-Jinah, Syria, US forces stuck a building where AQ and Syrian militant groups were meeting. An investigation, which combined NGO reporting and all other evidence found that the struck resulted in minimal damage to a little Mosque next door. This airstrike resulted in a single civilian injured. The Target Engagement Authority was unaware the smaller building was being built as a Mosque. This was due to intel analysts shift changes, etc. Thus, the approve chain would have been different for the strike. UNHRC issued a fatally flawed report on Syria, that found this airstrike likely in violation of IHL. However, world-leading scholars have refuted the report, which misapplies International law, and thus reaches an erroneous conclusion.<sup>[1](https://www.lawfareblog.com/unhrc-commission-inquiry-syria-misapplies-law-armed-conflict)</sup></sup>

- On April 6, 2017, following the illegal [Khan Sheykkun chemical attack](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2017_904.pdf) [by the Syrian regime](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_evaluation_nationale_-_anglais_-_final_cle0dbf47-1.pdf), the United States carried out [lawful strikes](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Assessing_US_Justifications_for_Using-Force_2.pdf) against Al Shayrat airfield, used by the regime to conduct its illegal chemical & conventional weapons attacks against civilians. 

- A [study](https://www.lawfareblog.com/should-us-military-receive-benefit-doubt-when-investigating-itself-alleged-war-crimes) by two world-leading experts concerning Iraq and Afghanistan US operations concludes, "We analyzed two sets of data dealing with these wars: the first, from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), details all founded investigations alleging serious law of armed conflict violations in Iraq and Afghanistan by Sailors, SEALs, and Marines; the second, from the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA), details all cases of alleged serious law of armed conflict violations by soldiers referred to court-martial. The NCIS data indicates that ninety-two allegations of serious law of armed conflict violations were substantiated, thirty-seven of which led to courts-martial (a number of others received non-judicial punishment), and twenty-eight of which resulted in conviction. The ACCA data shows 100 referred cases, of which seventy-eight resulted in conviction on at least one offense. Many of these cases resulted in substantial sentences, including life imprisonment."

- Contrary to sensational media allegations, US forces did not strike the Syrian dam on March 26, 2017. US forces struck the towers near the dam, used by ISIS. These towers are not connected to the dam. Further munitions used were non-cratering munitions. No civilians killed/injured, and no damage to the dam occurred, according to documents obtained by NYT.<sup>[1](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/nc-3-27-17-syria/bff38494ffb87814/full.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.centcom.mil/Portals/6/Documents/Transcripts/28MAR%20CJTFOIR%20GEN%20Townsend.pdf?ver=2017-03-31-075531-900)</sup></sup>

- On March 17 2017, a US airstrike [accidentally killed](https://archive.org/details/mosul-ar-15-6-investigation) 112 civilians in al Jadidah, Mosul. Again, Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also, unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional munitions that resulted in a secondary explosives effect. Again, targeteering, and other CIVCAS mitigation efforts were all present to avoid civilians and collateral damage to the surrounding buildings. Forensic analysis confirms it was the secondary explosives that ISIS owned, that caused the civilian deaths.

- A 2017 [report](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/inspections/SIGAR%2017-47-IP.pdf), requested by Congress, examined between FY 2011–16, finds that the US investigated all allegations of human rights abuses committed by Afghan forces, including child abuse reports made externally and internally, as best they could and cut off aid to those units implicated. Convictions were landed on those who committed the crimes. The report does find some issues, and the agencies involved have their comments at the end. There wasn't a consolidated process, and as US forces drew down—they lacked the insights they once had into abuse allegations. 
  >"SIGAR found no evidence that U.S. forces were told to ignore human rights abuses or child sexual assault."

  >"Following the establishment of the State and Defense Leahy Vetting Procedures for the Afghan National Security Forces in July 2014, and a biweekly joint DOD and State Afghanistan Gross Violation of Human Rights Forum (Leahy Forum), the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD-P) began to track gross violation of human rights incidents—including child sexual assault—that were reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum. According to data provided by OUSD-P, as of August 12, 2016, the office was tracking 75 reported gross violation of human rights incidents. Of these reported incidents, 7 involved child sexual assault, 46 involved other gross violations of human rights, and 22 were classified at a level above Secret because of the sensitivity of the information or the sources and methods used to obtain the information. These incidents ranged in date from 2010 through 2016, and included gross violations of human rights allegedly committed by Afghan security forces within the MOD and MOI. The incidents reported to and considered by the Leahy Forum came from a variety of sources including intelligence reports, news articles, U.S. forces, and the Afghan government."
 
  >"Of the 75 reported incidents in the OUSD-P tracker, 7 involved allegations of child sexual assault—1 that the Leahy Forum found to be credible, 5 that remain under review, and 1 that was found not credible. Five of the seven involved MOI units, and two involved MOD units. The one credible incident was reported by the Afghan government. In this instance, the government reported that two ANA Special Operations Command (ANASOC) noncommissioned officers (NCOs) attempted to sexually assault a girl to coerce information from her mother. Following a trial, both NCOs were indicted and convicted for attempted sexual assault of a minor in violation of the penal code and sentenced to 6 years of confinement. Based on the information the Afghan government provided, DOD determined that it had credible information of a gross violation of human rights and began the process to remediate the unit." 

   Also details improvements made on the Afghan side including legislative, as well as other high-level efforts by the US Government working with the Afghans.
   It found no evidence, as NGOs/media alleged, that US forces were told to ignore child sex abuse/other human rights abuses.
   
- On 28 January 2017, President Trump authorised a Special Operations raid in al-Bayda, Yemen. The raid was successful, though tragic, in its collection highly important information. Media and NGOs claimed that during the raid, a firefight killed as many as 30 or more civilians. This however, was a hoax. According to declassified documents obtained by the ACLU, show that high resolution footage (covering many Points of View), and sensitive intelligence, confirm between [4-12](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf) civilian casualties. [Women also participated](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400/Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.pdf) in the fight. Classified documents also obtained by the ACLU show the mission was authorised because it satisfied the [NCV 0](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/17-L-0705JS022.pdf) policy. That is, if there was even the possibility that just one CIVCAS was possible, the mission could not be approved.

- During the a battle in Boz Village, Kunduz, Afghanistan on Nov 3, 2016, Afghan Special Forces attempted to capture Taliban leaders responsible for the surge in violence that year. A small element of US troops were present to provide advice and assistance. Taliban forces opened fire from multiple buildings. US and Afghan forces were forced to request aerial fire support from U.S. platforms in self defense. Aerial fires were also used to suppress Taliban who were firing on U.S. medical evacuation assets as the dead and wounded were evacuated. Sadly, as a result of Taliban actions, 33 civilians were killed. An independent investigation concluded that U.S. air assets used the minimum amount of force required to neutralize the various threats from the civilian buildings and protect friendly forces. The investigation further concluded that no civilians were seen or identified in the course of the battle.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20170520120301/http://www.rs.nato.int/article/press-releases/civilian-casualties-confirmed-in-boz-village-kunduz.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/nov-2016-boz-airstrike)</sup></sup>

Further, an internal, independent report required by law, found that: no credible information indicating abuse of detainees in Yemen by U.S. personnel or U.S. allies and partners; DOD had not identified any violations of the DOD Leahy Law in Yemen and that DOD personnel had not observed any indications of detainee abuse by coalition partners or developed any credible information that U.S. allies or partners had committed any abuses against detainees in Yemen that would make them ineligible for assistance.<sup>[3](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105988.pdf#page=40)</sup></sup>

- In 2016, Obama released, per EO 13732 Sec. 3, data concerning High Value Target CT missions Outside Areas of Active Hostilities.
[The first](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF) report covers from Jan 2009 to Dec 2015. It shows that there was a total of 473 strikes with a total of between 2372-2581 combatants killed and only between 64-117 civilians killed. Following this, the [2016](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Summary-of-2016-Information-Regarding-United-States-Counterterrorism-Strikes-Outside-Areas-of-Active-Hostilities.pdf) report was issued, giving us: 53 total strikes. With 431-441 combatants killed and only 1 civilian killed. Both records make clear to refute the allegations that any "military-aged male" in area of target is deemed a combatant, or "retroactively" designated combatants. To quote, "Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants."

- From 2001 up to the present day, the drone campaign has resulted in disrupting many terrorist networks, and resulted in very few civilian casualties. Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the confirmation hearing for John Brennan, confirmed as a result of Congressional oversight, that the civilian deaths per year as a result of drone strikes is often in the [single digits](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/11331.pdf). Lethal strikes are only sought if [capture of HVTs is not feasible](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download). Leaked documents from the Intercept confirm that these missions (including ground raids) result in very few civilian casualties. From September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2012 in Afghanistan, out of a total of 2,082 missions only 14 civilians were killed or injured. That's 0.67%. Media have incorrectly claimed that these documents show a 90% civilian casualty rate from drone strikes. They neither are specific about drones nor, as shown, have a 90% CIVCAS stat—only a [0.67%](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2460857/operation-haymaker-afghanistan-documents.pdf#page=16).
Another document leaked confirms the time and care taken into approving each strike. Missions can only be approved by POTUS if the host nation consents. See [slide 6](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460856-small-footprint-operations-may-2013.html) and [slides 41 and 42](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460855-small-footprint-operations-february-2013.html).
From these, a picture starts to emerge:
  - The “average approval time” for a proposed strike under the AUMF process was 79 days. Even excluding the single longest approval, presumably an unrepresentative outlier, the average was 58 days. The fastest approval was 27 days.
  - These approvals were preceded by lengthy periods of gathering and analyzing intelligence on the targets—an average of six years.
  - Four out of 24 proposed concepts of operations covered by the study were disapproved under the AUMF review process.
  - The process for approving strikes under the AUMF “requires significant intel/ISR to justify (and maintain) approvals.” “Relatively few, high-level terrorists meet criteria for targeting” under this process. (Note that this isn’t a press release touting the program’s robust oversight; it’s an internal DOD assessment, written from the perspective of operators for whom a laborious approval process is an obstacle rather than a virtue.)
  - These “[p]olitical constraints” make these operations “challenging” and “fundamentally different from what we’ve experienced in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

  Further, the "drones cause blowback" talking-point has long been discredited in [academic literature](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article-abstract/42/4/47/12192/Do-U-S-Drone-Strikes-Cause-Blowback-Evidence-from?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

- On 3 October, 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U accidentally misidentified the Kunduz Trauma Centre, operated by Doctors without Borders. Per an [independent investigation](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2819730/RESPONSIVE-DOCUMENTS.pdf), "The ground force and aircrew were unaware the aircrew was firing on a hospital throughout the course of the engagement." This was caused due to technical and human error. "Due to the early launch, the aircrew did not have the typical information it would have on a mission. While en route to Kunduz, one of the aircraft's critical communications systems failed, resulting in the aircraft's inability to receive and transmit certain critical information to multiple command headquarters." While tragic—this is not a war crime. While hospitals are indeed protected buildings under international law, there are caveats: 1. A building can lose its protected status. 2. A building can become [dual-status](https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/documents/AFD-081009-011.pdf), see page 84 of this scholarly paper—and yet, it's a [real thing, see page 6 of this investigation](https://archive.org/details/informal-ar-15-6-investigation-findings-and-recommendations-for-the-al-hawijah), not just in academic theory. If part of the building is used by combatants while the rest by civilians, only that area may be targeted. 3. An accident. Since the tribunals of WW2, there has been a principle formed known as the Rendulic standard. To quote from the [2020 updated Operational Law Handbook](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/operational-law-handbook_2020.pdf), "The “Rendulic Rule:”  The Rendulic case also stands for a broader standard regarding liability for battlefield acts: commanders and personnel should be evaluated based on information reasonably available at the time of decision...There may be situations where, because of incomplete intelligence or the failure of the enemy to abide by the LOAC, civilian casualties occur.  Example:  The Iraqi Al Firdos C3 Bunker.  During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), U.S. military planners identified this Baghdad bunker as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters.  The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths.  Was there a violation of the LOAC?  Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces.  Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective.  Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made."

-  In 2014, Congress created a new authority for the Department of Defense (DoD) to train and equip select Syrians in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, Section 1209 of P.L. 113-291, as amended). This authority, as amended by subsequent legislation, enables DoD “to provide assistance, including: training equipment, supplies, stipends, construction of training and associated facilities, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals.” Such assistance activities are authorized for select purposes, including supporting U.S. efforts to combat the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria and promoting the conditions for a negotiated settlement to Syria’s civil war. <sup>[1](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33487.pdf)</sup></sup> These groups are vetted to make sure they're in compliance with international law regarding use of force, detention operations, etc. Per the [Leahy law](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PP410_INVEST_v2.1.pdf), the US Government is prohibited from using funds for assistance to units of foreign security forces where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights (GVHR). The training is not limited to military activity, but mandatorily includes promoting and educating the respect for the rule of law and human rights. An independent [audit](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Aug/22/2002174036/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2015-175.PDF) confirms that the vetting procedures, designed to identify derogatory information that would keep an individual from participating in the Syrian Training and Equipment program, “met and satisfied the criteria established under the 2015 NDAA.” It also provided some recommendations to further strengthen the effort. It is alleged that the CIA provided weapons and training to some rebel groups who went onto join terror orgs. Some cite that Trump's tweets that he ended such a program allegedly called "Timber Sycamore." However, Federal Court of appeals has determined he made no such confirmation.<sup>[2](https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/18-2112/18-2112-2020-07-09.pdf?ts=1594303207)</sup></sup> Some conspiracy theorists try to also suggest that the US worked with AQ by citing a declassified email by Clinton pursuant to a FOIA request where Jake Sullivan says to Hillary in a follow-up email, "See last item - AQ is on our side in Syria." However, the prior email concerns media reporting of AQ fighting the regime, that's it. That does not suggest they are working together at all.<sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20220610014916/https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_October_Release/C05789138.pdf)</sup></sup>
These conspiracy theorists also try to suggest a declassified DIA cable proves as such, but it doesn't even hint at such a thing. It merely says that after the fall of the Libyan regime, its stockpiles were found and shipped elsewhere.<sup>[4](https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pgs.-1-3-2-3-from-JW-v-DOD-and-State-14-812-DOD-Release-2015-04-10-final-version1.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On February 2012, in Afghanistan, 100 Qurans and other religious material were burned in an incinerator. Pundits claimed this was evidence of US not caring for the culture and religious material in Afghanistan as elsewhere. However, an [independent investigation](https://archive.org/details/quran-investigation) found this wasn't the reason:
   >On the night of 20 February 2012. up to 100 Qur'ans and other religious materials were burned in an incinerator at BAF. The events leading up to the incident involved a search of the library books in the library at the Detention Facility at In Parwan (DFIP). Because of suspicions that detainees were using library books to pass notes and messages, members of the 535th  Military Police (MP) Battalion (BN) and the Theatre Intelligence Group (TIG) Counter-Intelligence (CI) Team at  the DFIP planned a search of the books in the library. During the search, one of the interpreters helping to interpret the notes and messages written in the books reported that approximately 60-75 percent of the books in the library also contained extremist content. A junior leader perceived that he had permission from his commander to remove the objectionable materials from the library, and the library search team began to separate texts for removal. A work detail loaded the books into a supply truck as part of the nightly burn pit run. During the loading process an Afghan National Army (ANA) Soldier and an ANA interpreter expressed concern about removing the books to US Service Members loading the books. Because the US  Service Members thought that the books were contraband, they disregarded the ANA and interpreter's cautions. The ANA Soldier and interpreter then  voiced their concerns to DFIP Operations, but by the time that Battle Captains in DFIP Operations figured out what was happening. the truck was already on its way to the burn pit. Many books were burned before a local national at the burn pit noticed that some of the books were Qur'ans. 

  >Overall Findings. In the course of events on 20 February. I find that US  Service Members mishandled Qur'ans and other religious material, to include their disposal at an incinerator. I do not find  that those involved acted with any malicious intent to disrespect the Quran or defame the faith of Islam, however. Ultimately, this tragic incident resulted from a lack of cross-talk between leaders and commands, a lack of senior leader involvement in giving clear guidance in a complex operation, junior and mid-grade leaders choosing the easy way instead of the right way to address a problem. distrust among our US Service Members and our partners. ignorance by US Service Members with respect to the importance and handling of the Quran as well as other religious material. and poor adherence by US  Service Members to established procedures. Clearly a decisive point in the events that took place that day was the segregation of religious books based on the advice of primarily one linguist who characterized the books as "radical" or 'extremist' in nature. over-reliance on one linguist's interpretation of book content improperly influenced a series of tactical decisions, resulting in a strategic crisis. Nonetheless, US Service Members made the decision to segregate, remove, and bum the books and own the responsibility for their destruction. That US  Service Members did not heed the  warnings of their ANA partners is, perhaps. my biggest concern. Despite all the missteps, at no time was the path chosen by the involved US Service Members motivated by hatred or intolerance of a particular faith."

- Between 2013 and 2016, occasionally articles would appear alleging that US Special Forces (ODA 3124), while deployed to Wardak Province, Afghanistan in 2011, kidnapped, tortured and executed 15 civilians. These allegations were investigated several times, including a Joint Afghan/US team—all concluded the allegation unfounded. One then-former Afghan interpreter did beat a detainee, causing death. He was investigated and convicted by Afghan's Government. CID re-investigated the incident as new details were made public in 2015. However, it was determined to not support the allegations and was refuted.<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/wardak-cid)</sup></sup>

- In 2011, President Obama authorised the [lawful, Constitutional](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/pages/attachments/2015/04/02/2010-07-16_-_olc_aaga_barron_-_al-aulaqi.pdf) strike on a [senior al-Qa'ida member](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/107-3._panetta_declaration_6.10.2015_0.pdf), Anwar al-awlaki was the Chief of external operations. He was responsible for the planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the US and allied nations. He was most infamous for his pivotal role in AQAP's attempt to blow up a US airliner, bound for Detroit on December 25, 2009. The Government's [preference was to capture him](https://fas.org/irp/eprint/doj-lethal.pdf), but it was not feasible—and was deemed continuing to be an imminent threat.
His son was killed in this strike, but was not made the target. In January 2017, Trump approved a Special Forces raid in Yemen.

- While it is not known 100% who was behind Stux net virus, it is alleged to have been the US, who targeted Iran's nuclear weapons facilities in order to destroy key components of Iran's illegal program. However, the list alleges that this is the first use of a state actor conducting a cyber operation on another, and more specifically, the first case of cyber attacks—that the US bares responsibility for the "cyber arms race." This is utter nonsense. The first cyber warfare attacks are attributed to Russia against Estonia in 2007.<sup>[1](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/cyber_attacks_estonia.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On 2 September, 2010, Coalition forces conducted a precision airstrike and follow-on operation in Takhar Afghanistan, killing Maulawi Jawadullah, the Taliban district leader for Yangi Qalah of Takhar, along with seven of his associates. Allegations that the convoy were election officials was refuted after an independent joint investigation examined air weapons system footage and videos posted online.

- A 2010 [international group of experts](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1434_web.pdf), by the IAEA, reviewed four sites in Southern Iraq in which Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions were used in the 2003 conflict. The report finds:
  > "that the radiation doses from DU do not pose a radiological hazard to the population at the four studied locations in southern Iraq. The estimated annual committed effective radiation doses that could arise from exposure to DU residues are low, always less than 100 μSv/a and only to a few, if any, individuals, and therefore of little radiological concern. The estimated radiation doses are less than those received on average by individuals from natural sources of radiation in the environment (worldwide average 2.4 mSv/a), below internationally recommended dose limits for members of the public (1 mSv/a) and below the action level of 10 mSv/a set out in the IAEA Safety Standard on Remediation of Areas Contaminated by Past Activities and Accidents [1] to establish whether remedial actions are necessary... it is likely that the general picture is not very different at other locations in Iraq where DU was used in the 2003 conflict. The conclusions reached in international studies of other situations where DU munitions were employed (Kuwait and the Balkans) were similar to those of this report and support the belief that the radiological impact of the residues from the firing of DU munitions is also likely to be low in other parts of Iraq."


- On November 25, 2010 media alleged, that, according to local sources: US Navy SEALs and Special Forces killed 6 civilians in Shah Wali Khot, having them tied back to back then burned them alive.

- In 2010, Chelsea Manning leaked what became known as the 'Iraq and Afghan war logs.' It's worth noting that the vast majority of these leaks are in plain-text format. So while the [damaged caused was great](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3933088-Department-of-Defense-Final-Report-of-the.html)—to SIGINT, GEOINT and HUMINT—which put civilians at risk from attack, the actual things that matter to the media was the CIVCAS numbers. Sadly, no one is able to independently verify and confirm the plain-text files released by wikileaks are accurate. Even worse, some stories don't even cite to the plain-text files on wikileaks site. The only thing that was leaked, that seemed to indicate wrong-doing by the US Military, concerned a video, that was dubbed "collateral murder." However, upon critical examination of the facts and law, no war crime occurred: On July 12, 2007, a US Apache helicopter was providing force protection to Bravo Company 2-16. The Company had been in near continuous contact from insurgents since dawn. The Apache spotted a group of armed men heading in the direction of Bravo Company. The Apache kept its eye on the group until one person peaked around a corner, knelt, and shouldered what appeared to be an RPG. Indeed, the leaked footage from wikileaks confirms this. After the Apache cleared the building, it was cleared to engage the insurgents. After the dust settled: Unknown to the Apache crew, all but two people turned out to be insurgents—they were two journalists with Reuters. It must be highlighted that these two journalists were not wearing the standard 'press' or 'media' vests, nor did they tell the military they'd be present in an area that had seen fighting for days on end. Among the bodies, there were RPGs, AKMs, and other weapons. There was [no violation of the Laws of War, Rules of Engagement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1506533-30-2nd-brigade-combat-team-15-6-investigation-pdf.html), per the [Rendulic standard](https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/37173/Operational+Law+Handbook+2020.pdf/b8630e95-cdf6-4205-a7ca-4cf842ad8dd3?version=1.3#page=63) established during the WW2 Tribunals.

- On 21 February 2010, in the Uruzgan Province near Shahidi Hassas, US Forces mistakenly engaged a convoy of civilians. Initial observations did indicate a possible threat of force via weapons and tactical manoeuvring. Patience was displayed, allowing the situation to develop over several hours. However, miscommunication made it for naught. The miscommunication and misunderstanding occurred between drone pilots at Creech AFB, Nevada, screeners in Florida, and the command posts. The GFC acted within ROE, with the information he was presented, however, information that should have triggered a reevaluation were missed. Weapons were observed to be present prior to and during engagement. However, the moment the helicopters attempted to reengage, they noticed what appeared to be women and children, after they exited the second vehicle—they ceased engaging.<sup>[1](https://ia801009.us.archive.org/32/items/centcom-10-0218-01/centcom-10-0218-01.pdf)</sup></sup>

- 12 February 2010 in Gardez District, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, news reports had claimed US Special Forces deliberately killed a pregnant woman, and covering it up. An independent investigation was ordered to answer two principle questions: Did the ground force deliberately mislead its higher headquarters in initial reports regarding this incident and did the ground force attempt to hide the circumstances surrounding the casualties by altering, tampering with, and/or cleaning up the incident scene? The investigation [concludes](https://archive.org/details/gardez-15-6) that the answer to both of these questions is "No" and recommends no disciplinary action against the assault force members. The facts gathered in this investigation indicate that ground forces were unaware that the females were killed when they engaged Mohad Zahir after he emerged from a building in the compound with an AK-47 pointed at the assault force on the roof.

- In 4 May 2009, Bala Balouk District, Farah Province, Afghanistan—The Special Operations Marines (MARSOC) & Afghan SF units called in CAS with (4) F/A-18F strikes. Another (3) strikes were called in for a B-1B Bomber. Civilian casualties resulted because of the complex environment: "The use of military force in this engagement with the Taliban was an appropriate means to destroy that enemy threat within the requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  However, the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimize accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties. Throughout the conduct of this operation, the Ground Force Commander' s (GFC) ability to break contact was hampered by the effects of direct fire contact with a significant enemy force, a  lengthy effort to medically evacuate (MEDEVAC) U.S. and Afghan critically injured personnel by helicopter, and persistent, real-time intelligence on the enemy's continuing efforts to manoeuvre, mass, re-arm, and re-attack friendly forces from within the village. The independent investigation concluded that the Laws of Armed Conflict were followed. At least 26 civilians were killed. Around 78 Taliban were killed.

- On 22 August, 2008, US Close Air Support killed 33 civilians in Azizabad, Afghanistan. US MARSOC and Afghan Special Forces executed a kill/capture of a High Value Target. After successful infiltration, the Afghan/US team received hostile force engagement. They requested CAS. Unknown to both US & Afghan forces, the hostile engagement positions were in close proximity to civilians. Allegations that the US/Afghan forces committed violations of the Rules of Engagement or Law of War during the 21-22 August 2008 firefight resulting in 90 civilian deaths are [unsubstantiated](https://archive.org/details/Azizabad-august-2008-MARSOC/mode/2up). The first investigation concluded there was 6 civilians killed. Subsequent to new information provided by UNAMA, ICRC, etc, the US conducted another, more comprehensive investigation. It found that there were 33 CIVCAS and 22 anti-coalition  militants died. The independent investigation 28 interviews resulting in more than 20 hours of recorded testimony from Afghan government officials, Afghan village elders, officials from IGOs/NGOs, US and Afghan service members, 236 documents and 11 videos. It also found villager statements heavily inconsistent, and other severe methodological flaws by the NGOs and UNAMA. The second investigation also incorporated FBI forensic teams to aid its efforts.

- [4 March, 2007](https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/galvin-pentagon-report-1549974003.pdf), Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, a MSOC-F (a unit of MARSOC, Marine Special Operations Command), "convoy was subject to a complex ambush. Small arms fire, and a Suicide Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device approached the convoy at a high rate of speed and detonated. The convoy defended against additional near-simultaneous attacks, quickly regrouped, and resumed movement west on Highway A1 using authorised procedures to disperse the crowds and unblock the road to allowing the convoy to continue its westward route. Within 30 minute of the blast, and the convoy's return to base, internet media reports began surfacing indicating that a coalition convoy had opened fir on civilians, killing and wounding many. An Air Force Colonel was appointed to conduct an investigation into the facts surrounding the incident. The Colonel ignored statements by those in the  convoy, ignored EOD specialists, and placed too much at face value on alleged witness testimony.
Another investigation was appointed, a formal Court of Inquiry (COI) to independently determine the facts and circumstances relative to the actions of MSOC-F. After hundreds of interviews, a complete examination of the documentary evidence, the COI found the statements and testimony of the personnel in the MSOC-F convoy to be consistent, truthful, and credible. The COI found that MSOC-F Marines defended appropriately and proportionately against the 4 March 2007 enemy ambush, and that a non-governmental organization employee's unbiased testimony independently corroborated the testimony of the MSOC-F personnel. The COI opined that the findings and conclusions found in Col P's investigation run counter to the weight of the evidence considered by the Court. Additionally, Col P never interviewed the Reconnaissance Operations Center (ROC) Watch Officer on duty, nor did he review the ROC log to determine the sequence of events on 4 March to determine exactly what was reported and to whom it was reported. Based on his conclusion that the use of force applied by the personnel in the convoy was excessive, Col P recommended various personnel in the MSOC-F convoy be charged. Col P's investigation was discredited and the magnitude of his errors cannot be overstated. Col P was in possession of overwhelmingly clear evidence that MSOC-F was ambushed and responded in a discriminate and effective manner. Col P. suppressed exculpating evidence and inexplicably accepted the testimony of Afghans he stopped, apparently randomly, and questioned, making no effort to ascertain the location of the Afghans on 4 Mach 2007 and making no effort to corroborate their statements. Col P did not examine key locations, did not interview any of the Afghans allegedly injured by the Marines, and did not examine the ammunition logs." This is also known as the Shinwar shooting.

Separately, the investigation finds it likely that noncombatants were killed. But could not determine by who.
 
- Contrary to some sensational headlines, on October 30, 2006, the US did not conduct a drone strike to target Zawahiri in Chingai (Chenagai) Pakistan, that killed 80 people. Pakistani officials publicly confirmed it was their helicopter gunship that did. The US also officially denied it, per Major Matt Hackathorn, "It was completely done by the Pakistani military."<sup>[1](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/30/world/asia/30iht-pakistan.3335330.html?_r=0)</sup></sup>

- On May 9, 2006, Girouard, Hunsaker and Clagett killed 3 detainees during operation Iron Triangle. They attempted to cover it up, however, an independent investigation by CID found their testimony inconsistent. In their defense, they tried to allege they were permitted to kill any military aged male in the area, under the ROEs communicated by Col. Steele. However, a seperate investigation found this was not the case.<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/investigation-op-iron-triangle/page/169/mode/2up)</sup></sup> These 3 men were each convicted.

- March 12, 2006. Mahmudiyah rape and killings. Drunk these men set off from a checkpoint to rape and kill Iraqi civilians. Upon an independent investigation, the men were charged and convicted. James P. Barker had to enter plea deal to not get the death penalty. Got 90 years prison time. 
Paul E. Cortez got 100 years prison. Jesse V. Spielman 110 years prison. Bryan L. Howard 2.5 years prison, (he didn't do the crime, but lied to cover for the others. Steven Dale Green narrowly escaped death sentence. Life in prison. No parole. He died in prison.  
 
- On March 15, 2006 in Ishaqi, Iraq, between 3-9 civilians were killed in an airstrike on a building that was later destroyed. According to an independent investigation, "Allegations that the troops executed a family living in this safe house, and then hid the alleged crimes by directing an airstrike, are absolutely false, the raid's ground commander had adhered to the rules of engagement."<sup>[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua1fohSFfws)</sup></sup>
 
- On November 19, 2005, in Haditha, Iraq: a patrol from Company K, 3d Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), mounted in High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles(HMMWVs), was struck by an IED and received some small arms fire near the intersection of Routes Chestnut and Viper in Haditha, Iraq. The patrol suffered one FKIA and two FWIA as a result of the IED attack. During actions taken by the patrol in response to the attack, at least 24 Iraqi civilians were killed near the IED site. Following standard procedures of condolence payments sent to family of victims, reporting came in containing allegations of deliberate and wrongful killings by the Marines. On 14 February 2006, the MNC-1 Commander directed Colonel G.A. Watt to conduct an AR 15-6 investigation into the incident. The investigation concluded that there had been no intentional targeting of noncombatants; that overall, throughout the entire engagement, Marines had attempted to distinguish combatants from noncombatants; that the force used was proportional, and that the Marines provided adequate medical care to non-coalition force casualties. His investigation concluded that the insurgents had violated the LOAC essentially by using homes occupied by noncombatants to attack the Marines. Colonel Watt, however, did conclude that Marines had failed to comply with the ROE in that they had failed to positively identify (PID) targets as legitimate before engaging, resulting in the death of noncombatants. As a result, Colonel Watt recommended further investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) or NCIS. NCIS investigated this matter and found some evidence that two individuals talked to each other about fabricating their accounts of the incident. However, a new, authoritative, final review known as the [Bargewell report](https://www.mcmilitarylaw.com/documents/000_mg_bargewell_15-6__haditha_report_.bates.pdf) was established and found, even with the additional evidence provided by NCIS, " as noted, NCIS did uncover evidence that certain squad members coordinated false stories on specific aspects of the incident; however, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the overall deficiencies in reporting and follow-on action—while sometimes perplexing—were not the result of an extensive and orchestrated criminal cover-up throughout the chain of command."

  An Investigating Officer [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/specials/iraq/documents/SharrattReport070607.pdf), examined all evidence presented at an Article 32 hearing, and independently concluded Marines acted in accordance with ROEs, specifically LCpl Sharratt.<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/lcpl_sharratt_report)</sup></sup>
  
- On August 28, 2005, Reuters journalists in an unmarked vehicle, were filming an ongoing insurgent ambush of the Iraqi Police Services (IPS) and U.S. forces personnel in Bagdad. Around the time of the resurgence, a soldier on the Mall roof observed a lone white vehicle stopped on the roadway at the point where a roadway ramp closest to the Mall merged into an adjacent, parallel road; the roadway where the ambush was ongoing. When observed, the vehicle faced north and was south of the 256th BCT vehicles responding to the ambush. The soldier said he saw the passenger hanging out the window pointing something that appeared to be an RPG; the soldier then yelled an alarm, “RPG.” The soldiers’ team leader heard the alarm and observed the vehicle stopped immediately west of them and facing north toward the 256th BCT vehicles and the ambush area. He also saw the passenger hanging out the passenger window pointing something toward the tanks. He could not positively identify the object and asked another team member to bring binoculars. The team leader testified that by the time he got the binoculars, the passenger had pulled himself and the object he pointed back inside the vehicle; the object was no longer visible. The team leader said he shouted at the people in the vehicle to get them to stop whatever they were doing and he and his team fired warning shots to get their attention. He told us he fired the first shots expecting the vehicle to stay where it was, but it began to back up. They fired more warning shots and when the vehicle did not halt, the team leader ordered disabling shots. Each of the four soldiers on the roof fired disabling shots. Three of the soldiers used M-4 rifles. The fourth solider used an M-249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW). The vehicle slowed and rolled to a stop against a roadway lane barrier south of the soldiers’ position. The team leader reported disabling the vehicle, and one of the tank commanders, using the tank’s optical system, observed the disabled vehicle’s driver apparently dead. The tank commander told the team leader to continue surveillance of the vehicle and keep it in place until the tanks and other 256th BCT vehicles finished searching for the people who initiated the ambush. The soldiers remained on the observation post (OP) until the IO arrived at the scene. About 20 minutes later, the tanks and other 256 the BCT vehicles arrived at the disabled white vehicle. According to the cameraman, who had remained out of sight in the front passenger seat, he sat up and called out “Reuters Cameraman” to the approaching soldiers. This engagement abided by ROE. Reuters Baghdad bureau’s safety practices contributed to the incident. The bureau chief authorized an exception to general safety procedures, allowing local national journalists to enter hostile environments in private passenger vehicles without press markings and without the occupants wearing safety equipment.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20090401200028/http://www.dodig.osd.mil/Inspections/IPO/reports/Reuters%20Final%20Print%20Version.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- In November, 2004, in Fallujah, Iraq, TF 2-2 provided indirect fire support to US forces during the battle for Fallujah. During the battle, TF 2-2 lawfully deployed White Phosphorus munitions, described as "shake and bake", to flush out insurgents out of trench lines and spider holes, because of its Psychological impact. To quote from the March 2005 magazine [Field Artillery](https://sill-www.army.mil/fires-bulletin-archive/archives/2005/MAR_APR_2005/MAR_APR_2005_FULL_EDITION.pdf), 'The Fight for Fallujah', "WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE. We fired “shake and bake” missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out." This entry was misquoted by media to allege that US forces were deploying WP munitions against combatants for its incendiary and/or chemical effects. 

  US forces also maintained strict ROEs to mitigate civilian casualties during the entire campaign in Fallujah.<sup>[1](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA530831.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In May 2004, US conducted a raid near the Iraq-Syrian border, targeting several HVTs of the Zarqawi network. The NYT and AP alleged this was a wedding near Mukaradeeb, where many civilians were killed as a result of the raid. However, Signals, Human and Satellite intelligence as well as forensic and contradictory and inconsistent local testimony during interviews proved this allegation [false](https://archive.org/details/may-18-04-raid).

- On April 2004, Iraq, CPL Pat Tillman was killed in a friendly fire incident. Pundits claim that he was deliberately killed by his fellow unit members because he had anti-war leanings, and allege there was a coverup. This erroneous conclusion is based on a misreading of several basic facts. 
  
  Background: 
  On April 22, 2004, the 2nd Platoon, A Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment was conducting operations in the vicinity of Magarah, Afghanistan. Because of difficulties caused by an inoperable tactical vehicle, and the mission to achieve an established objective by nightfall, the platoon ground assault convoy, consisting of 41 Army Rangers, 4 Afghan Military Forces (AMF) soldiers, and 12 vehicles, was split into 2 groups or "serials."
  Serial 1 consisted of 19 Rangers traveling in  4 U.S. vehicles and 2 AMF vehicles,
including First Lieutenant (1LT) (the Platoon Leader), CPL Tillman; and 4 AMF soldiers. Serial 2, commanded by Sergeant First Class (SFC) (the Platoon Sergeant), consisted of 22 Rangers and two local Afghans traveling in 4 U.S. vehicles and a privately owned local vehicle .

  After the split, Serial 1 traveled down the canyon road without incident arriving in the vicinity of the village of Manah. Serial 2, however, did not proceed along the separate planned route because SFC believed the risk of accidental injury or death to be too great given the terrain. Therefore, SFC  ordered Serial 2 to travel down the same canyon road that Serial 1 had taken earlier. While traveling down the canyon road, Serial 2 carne under attack from enemy mortar or rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire originating from the top of the canyon walls. Upon hearing them, Serial 1 personnel, led by Staff Sergeant (SSG)(the squad leader), dismounted their vehicles and moved on foot through a small (6-building) village to an elevated spur overlooking the canyon road below and across from the southern ridgeline. CPL Tillman, Private First Class (PFC) and an AMF soldier positioned themselves on the forward slope of the spur visible from and exposed to the canyon road below. lLT and Specialist (SPC) (the Radio Operator), having been delayed by handling communications devices, were positioned at the base of a building in the village some distance below and to the rear of SSG and other Serial 1 personnel.
 
  The first U.S. vehicle in Serial 2 was led by SSG (the squad leader), with a driver and five other occupants. As SSG and his crew moved down the canyon
road, they fired their weapons in suppressive fire along the canyon walls. When SSG's vehicle exited the narrow portion of the canyon road below the spur where CPL Tillman and his team were located, occupants saw muzzle flashes coming from that position. SSG and his team directed their fire toward the muzzle flashes killing both CPL Tillman and the AMF soldier. As SSG's vehicle proceeded past the spur toward the village, vehicle occupants continued to fire on the building in the settlement hitting 1LT in the face and SPC in the knee and chest with small arms fire.

  Aftermath and investigations:
  Several investigates were initiated because, while concluding there was fratricide, contained quality issues. Tillman's Regimental Commander wanted no stone unturned, warranting several investigations to meet this end. The day after the incident, evidence emerged there was fratricide. Tillman's battalion commander (a lieutenant colonel three levels below the Combatant Commander), with the concurrence of his regimental commander, appointed a subordinate Army captain to investigate. That investigation, completed in about 2 weeks, determined CPL Tillman's death was fratricide caused by leadership failures and tactical errors. Dissatisfied with the thoroughness of that investigation, CPL Tillman's regimental commander (a colonel) ordered his own executive officer (a lieutenant colonel) to conduct a second investigation. That investigation, building on the first, was completed in 9 days, confirmed death by friendly fire, and provided expanded findings on the contributing tactical errors. The IG review finds,  "We concluded that the first two investigations, conducted by officers in CPL Tillman's battalion and regiment under Army Regulation (AR) 15-6, "Procedures for Investigating Officers and Boards of Officers," were tainted by the failure to preserve evidence, a lack of thoroughness, the failure to pursue logical investigative leads, and conclusions that were open to challenge based on the evidence provided. More significantly, neither investigator visited the site to visually reenact the incident, secure physical evidence, take photographs, or obtain accurate measurements. As a result, the first two investigations lacked credibility and contributed to perceptions that Army officials were purposefully withholding key information concerning CPL Tillman's death. In November 2004, because oflingering concerns regarding CPL Tillman's death, the Acting Secretary of the Army directed that Lieutenant General (LTG) Phillip R. Kensinger, Jr., Commander, U.S. Army Special Operations Command (Airborne) (USASOC), conduct a third investigation. LTG Kensinger appointed a subordinate, Brigadier General (BG) Gary M. Jones, Commander, U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne), to conduct the investigation. BG Jones' investigation was more thorough than the first two, included an on-site visit, and was pronounced legally sufficient by LTG Kensinger's Staff Judge Advocate in January 2005. Notwithstanding our conclusions with respect to these three investigations, we emphasize that all investigators established the basic facts of CPL Tillman's death -- that it was caused by friendly fire, that occupants of one vehicle in CPL Tillman's platoon were responsible, and that circumstances on the ground at the time caused those occupants to misidentify friendly forces as hostile. None of the investigations suggested that CPL Tillman's death was other than accidental. Our review, as well as the investigation recently completed by the Army CID, obtained no evidence contrary to those key findings.CPL Tillman's family members were not told of the investigations and subsequent fratricide determination until 35 days after CPL Tillman's death, despite Army regulations that require next of kin be advised of additional information concerning a Service member's death as that information becomes available. Because CPL Tillman's regimental commander desired to keep information concerning the death "close hold" until investigative results were finalized, no "supplemental reports" were issued to correct initial reports that CPL Tillman's death was caused by enemy fire. Although LTG Kensinger knew friendly fire was suspected and under investigation before he served as the Army representative at CPL Tillman's memorial service on May 3, 2004, he decided to withhold notification from family members until all facts concerning the incident could be verified."
  
  BG Jones testified that he determined Pat's friend destroyed his personal items because: (1) CPL Tillman's death had already been established as fratricide by Service members who performed the destruction and who, therefore, saw no need to retain evidence; (2) the retained items were
permeated with blood and posed a biological hazard." This, however, did go against DoD regulations on evidence prevervation—consequently, those Rangers were kicked out of the Military, among other punishments. Lastly, two independent forensic reviews concluded under CID, that the two deaths were accidental, and that tight groupings of the bullets are very much possible and common, especially when mounted.<sup>[1](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/16/2001955054/-1/-1/1/TILLMAN_REDACTED_WEB_0307-1.PDF)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.c-span.org/video/?197332-1/findings-corporal-tillman-death)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/LLI/Ethics/Leadership%20Ethics%20LOW%20Discussion%20Guide%20Minus%20Hadith%202008.pdf?ver=2018-09-25-100015-853#page=126)</sup></sup>

- On 30 June, [2002](https://web.archive.org/web/20021207215250/http://www.centcom.mil/News/Reports/Investigation_Oruzgan_Province.htm), in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan, recon and other coalition aircraft came under fire from a number of compounds by AAA batteries. An AC-130 was called in. There were people within this area of Oruzgan Province that regularly aimed and fired of variety of weapons at coalition aircraft. These weapons represented a real threat to coalition forces. As OFT commenced, AAA weapons were fired and, as a result, an AC-130 aircraft, acting properly and in accordance with the rules, engaged the locations of those weapons. Great care was taken to strike only those sites that were actively firing that night. While the coalition regrets the loss of innocent lives, the responsibility for that loss rests with those that knowingly directed hostile fire at coalition forces. The operators of those weapons elected to place them in civilian communities and elected to fire them at coalition forces at a time when they knew there were a significant number of civilians present. 

- Conspiracy theorists claim that after the US invaded Iraq in 2003, it stole money and gold from Saddam for unstated reasons. However, in reality these assets were used for reconstruction efforts, under what would eventually become known as the Commander’s Emergency Response Program (CERP). "In  March  2003,  in  the  initial  phases  of  U.S.  combat  operations  in  Baghdad,  a  large  quantity of  cash—more than $900 million in all—was discovered hidden behind  a villa belonging to one of Saddam Hussein’s key associates. In April,  President  George  W.  Bush  issued  a  memorandum  giving  DoD  the   authority to spend such cash to assist Iraqis and support reconstruction efforts. CERP, the name that would be given to this authority in June 2003, was born."<sup>[1](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1508.html)</sup></sup>

- In 2003, the US legally invaded Iraq pursuant to UNSC Resolution 1441.<sup>[1](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1096&context=ils)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1097&context=ils)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/preemption-iraq-and-international-law/673D4DFDBFA2DA8C5492B8E93AC3A66F)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/international-law-and-the-war-in-iraq/9497441CD9732611CF7226DC3B4ADF6B)</sup></sup> This was preceded by years of Iraqi non-compliance with prior resolutions + a ceasefire agreement. The popular myth is that the US and UK Governments lied to justify invasion. However, a review of the declassified record shows this claim to be a hoax:
 [Response to the independent report of the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-intelligence-and-security-committee-report-on-iraqi-weapons-of-mass-destruction) concerning Iraq WMDs and in examining  whether  the  available intelligence,  which  informed  the  decision  to  invade  Iraq,  was  adequate  and  properly assessed and whether it was accurately reflected in Government publications. 
The Committee found the following key conclusions:
  -  The September dossier was endorsed by the whole JIC (ISC Report, paragraph 106).
  -  The  September  dossier  was  founded  on  the  intelligence  assessments  then available (paragraph 107). 
  -  The September dossier was not ’sexed up’ by Alastair Campbell or anyone else (paragraph 108). 
  -  The  JIC  was  not  subjected  to  political  pressures.  Its  independence  and impartiality were not compromised in any way (paragraph 108)

  Another British review, in 2004, found much of the intelligence "well-founded".<sup>[5](https://irp.fas.org/world/uk/butler071404.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
  A Senate Intelligence Committee study, titled, _[Whether public statements regarding Iraq by US Govt Officials were substantiated by Intelligence information](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/110345.pdf#page=117)_ found that all public statements by US officials were indeed supported by the intelligence at the time.

  Another [study](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf#page=368) by the same committee found that no intelligence was fabricated, or skewed or that analysts were pressured to making an assessment.
   >"The Committee was not presented with  any evidence that intelligence  analysts changed their judgments  as a result of political pressure, altered  or produced  intelligence products to conform  with Administration  policy, or that  anyone even attempted to coerce, influence  or pressure  analysts to do so.  When asked whether  analysts were pressured  in any way to alter their assessments  or make their judgments  conform  with Administration policies, not a single analyst answered yes."

  It has been alleged in false press reports and political pundits that Rumsfeld, the Deputy Secretary, Doug Feith and others in the Defense Department distorted intelligence in order to argue that Iraq had a direct role in the 9/11 attacks, or that Iraq and al-Qaida had a stronger relationship than shown by facts known at the time, in order to propel the United States to war on false pretenses. This conspiracy theory was debunked by a 2007 DoD OIG report, management comments and a Congressional review. A seperate Congressional report found, "The analysts interviewed indicated that most of the OSD staffers' concerns had to do with the use of too many caveats to the reporting, and the "tone" of the document. Each analyst, as well as the meeting's chairman, indicated the OUSDP staffer 'played by IC rules' in terms of their participation. In other words, each point that was raised was discussed, debated, and incorporated only if there was agreement around the table."<sup>[6](https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/ousd011707.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[7](https://archive.org/details/pctegreview)</sup></sup> <sup>[8](https://web.mit.edu/simsong/www/iraqreport2-textunder.pdf#page=372)</sup></sup> <sup>[9](https://archive.org/details/osp-overview)</sup></sup>
  
  It's worthy to note the ISG uncovered information that the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) maintained throughout 1991 to 2003 a set of undeclared covert laboratories to research and test various chemicals and poisons, primarily for intelligence operations. The existence, function, and purpose of the laboratories were never declared to the UN. The IIS program included the use of human subjects for testing purposes. Chemical weapons continued to be located and destroyed from 2004 to 2011.<sup>[10](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1307507-nytfoiarequest.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[11](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1307370/duelfer-report-volume-iii.pdf)</sup></sup> CIA's own retrospective series also concludes that Iraq's own actions, even when seemingly trying to become transparent, made them look suspicious. And of course, their often less than forthcoming on other areas raised concerns with many foreign intelligence services, not just the US and UN.<sup>[12](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=721802)</sup></sup>

## Interrogations/detentions 2002-2008
Due to considerable public confusion (thanks in large part to media/NGO pundits) on GWOT's detention activities, it's prudent to concisely clarify that there are 3 areas distinct from one another: 
   1) Abu Ghraib and Bagram: Had rare cases of unauthorised detainee abuse, only some of these led to death and GBH, all responsible were investigated, charged and convicted. This is where the famous photos come from. Over 60,000 total detainees were treated humanely and with respect.
   2) GTMO: had seen approved of techniques that closely followed FM 34-52, such as faked identity of interrogator, deception such as forged documents, and yelling, (though not in the ear). No enhanced techniques from CIA. 
   3) CIA blacksites: In Afghanistan, had several approved enhanced techniques that had undergone legal scrutiny from DOJ, WH and CIA. These techniques were designed to fall below the threshold of torture under US and International law.<sup>[1](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-yoofinal.pdf#page=41)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-bybeefinal.pdf#page=52)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://irp.fas.org/agency/doj/opr-margolis.pdf)</sup></sup>
    
  Neither GTMO or the CIA facilities saw cases of the abuses that were, themselves, rare at Abu and Bagram. The following entries below cover these 3 areas. It must also be noted, that while the Bush Administration found that AQ and the Taliban were not subject to the Geneva Convention as unlawful combatants, it was US Policy and its obligation under IHL to still treat detainees in accordance with the Conventions.<sup>[4](https://web.archive.org/web/20201103234604/http://www.dia.mil/FOIA/FOIA-Electronic-Reading-Room/FOIA-Reading-Room-Detainee-Abuse/FileId/39858/)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/26/items/sanchez-ig-report-pt-2/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt2.pdf#page=28)</sup></sup>
  
#### CIA Interrogations/detention (blacksites):
- Under the September 17, 2001 Memorandum of Notification, the CIA engaged in a covert program to capture, detain, and later interrogate senior AQ members. This program exampled effective oversight improvements over time, indeed, [Congressional staffers](https://ia802305.us.archive.org/18/items/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program/cia-congress-interactions-regarding-cia-rdi-program.pdf#page=14) notes that one CIA Black Site, "upon departing... compared the facility to both the US Military detention facility at Bagram and the facility at Guantanamo Bay. Both remarked that the facility "was markedly cleaner, healthier, more humane and better administered facility."
An independent [audit](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4454538/Document-20-CIA-Office-of-the-Inspector-General.pdf) of CIA facilities notes, "Detainees at facilities operated by CTC/RDG are provided essentials of shelter, clothing, nourishment, and hygiene; medical and psychological examinations and treatment; limited [[but high quality]](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20887990-00000000-cia-hvd-program) dental and vision care; opportunities for physical exercise and intellectual, religious, and recreational pursuits; and daily contact with facility staff. Detainees are held in solitary confinement in climate-controlled, lighted, aboveground, windowless cells that are equipped with a mattress, a sink, and a toilet. None of the detainees showed any apparent physical signs of mistreatment."

  The EITs used by the Agency were highly effective, thwarting a number of planned AQ attacks, contrary to the discredited SSCI majority report's allegation<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1377197/ssci-minorityviews.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1377196/cia-response-to-senate-report.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
  Renditions are perfectly legal under international law.<sup>[1](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=luclj)</sup></sup>
  
  On January 2, 2008, Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed an Assistant United States Attorney to review prior CIA's interrogation of 101 detainees and their treatment. In his preliminary review which concluded in 2011, he found 99 cases above board with 0 abuse, mistreatment or torture under US and International law. In two cases, he found evidence warranted a full criminal investigation—that investigation closed in 2012, and found no evidence of violation of law.<sup>[1](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-regarding-investigation-interrogation-certain-detainees)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-eric-holder-closure-investigation-interrogation-certain-detainees)</sup></sup>

  Even within CTC, any detainees reporting to be mistreated and use of unauthorised techniques were thoroughly, independently investigated. Indeed, CTC/Legal [forwarded](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120073426/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/0006541723.pdf) Mr. Hawsawi's complaints to the OIG. They, in turn, forwarded it to the DOJ, as the allegations as alleged, if true—would be in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. 2340A Torture. All investigations found no evidence to support the allegations, however, still updated the DOJ on the matter in 2006. This, among others, shows the Agency is not afraid to self-report allegations even by detainees for investigation. It has also been falsely claimed that the CIA did "forced feeding" via the anal route as a humiliating, unauthorised technique. However, an independent [review](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1377196/cia-response-to-senate-report.pdf) found, "Medical personnel who administered rectal rehydration did not do so as an interrogation technique or as a means to degrade a detainee but, instead, utilized the well-acknowledged medical technique to address pressing health issues." It also highlights two main points:
  - > The technique was deemed safer than using IV needles with noncompliant detainees and was considered more efficient than a naso-gastric tube.
   
  - > With respect to Majid Khan, in contrast to the Study's account, our records indicate Khan removed his naso-gastric tube, which posed the risk of injury and other complications. Given this dangerous behavior, rectal rehydration was considered the most appropriate means of addressing the potential harm Khan might inflict  on himself."
  
- On November 2002, Gul Rahman died in CIA detention. An independent [investigation](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/0006555318.pdf) found that he was not subject to torture or mistreated—that his own actions lead to his death. It reached the following conclusions:
  - >There is no evidence to suggest that Rahman's death was deliberate.
  - >There is no evidence to suggest Rahman was beaten, tortured, poisoned, strangled, or smothered.
  - >Gul Rahman's actions contributed to his own death. By throwing his last meal he was unable to provide his body with a source of fuel to keep warm. Additionally, his violent behavior resulted in his restraint which prevented him from generating body heat by moving around and brought him in direct contact with the concrete floor leading to the loss of body heat through conduction.
   
   This was also subject to an OIG investigation, and forwarded to DOJ for prosecutorial determination. DOJ notified it would not charge, but would include it in an ongoing special counsel review by the Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. An independent [study](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1377196/cia-response-to-senate-report.pdf) of the RDI program found that in addition to OIG investigations and criminal prosecutions—including the extensive multi-year investigation of RDI activity by a DOJ special prosecutor, which reviewed more than 100 detainee cases—CIA convened six accountability proceedings, either at the directorate or higher level, from 2003 to 2012.
 In total, these reviewed assessed the performance of 30 individuals (staff officers and contractors), and 16 were deemed accountable and sanctioned. OIG conducted two seperate major reviews and at least 29 seperate investigations of alleged misconduct. Some of these reviews were self-initiated by Agency components responsible for managing the program. CIA made numerous referrals to the OIG relating to the conduct of Agency officers and their treatment of detainees, during the life of the program as well as after. When actions appeared to violate criminal prohibitions, referrals were made to the DOJ.
 
  In total, OIG conducted nearly 60 investigations on RDI-related matters. In over 50, OIG found the allegations to be unsubstantiated or otherwise did not make findings calling for accountability review. Of the remaining cases, one resulted in a felony conviction, one resulted in termination of a contractor, and revocation of his security clearances, and six led to accountability reviews. 
  
- In 2003, the US detained Ammar al-Baluchi, an AQ operative, whose interrogation sessions provided key details on senior AQ members, disrupting plots, etc.<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1377197/ssci-minorityviews.pdf)</sup></sup> When Ammar was transfered to GTMO, he alleged a number of various abuses against him, however, an independent IG investigation that resulted from those allegations, concluded:
  - That he was not hit in the head with a bar or pipe.
  - That he was not given a vaccination that made him crazy.
  - That he was not hit on hise nose, causing it to bleed.
  - That he was not kept in a freezing cell.
  - That he was not threatened sexually.
  
   The review notes that all blacksites providing a high quality care: Providing Halal meals, personal video games, books, movies, and religious items, etc. Each cell contained an in-room personal shower, gym, Koran and was climate-controlled (heater/aircon). The facilities were sterile, clean—efficient, modern–invoking a surreal feeling. During routine, monthly doctor checkups, Baluchi had two teeth fillings. In 2004, due to his fasting, fainted in his cell, causing a head injury—about half an inch long to the back side of the head.<sup>[2](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21416908/exhibit-c-baluchi.pdf)</sup></sup>  
  
- Around January 2004, the CIA detained Khalid' Abd al-Razzaq al-Masri, a German citizen. This, however was an error. Not a case of mistaken identity, but a lack of intelligence to justify holding him. It was believed he was a known HVI, who goes by the alias, Khalid al-Masri. However, by mid March it was determined he should be released. The German Government was notified and he was sent back clandestinely, in May 2004. Post-release, he levied a number of accusations against the CIA. That he was sodomized, beaten, injected with drugs, and forced fed. These claims were investigated, among other things such as how he was wrongfully detained by an independent Inspector General review, which [finds](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4454539/Document-21-CIA-Office-of-the-Inspector-General.pdf):
  >OIG's investigation found no credible information that al-Masri was subjected to physical abuse of any kind while in CIA custody. Evidence gathered during the investigation suggests that the experience that gave rise to al-Masri's allegation he was sodomized was, in fact, a routine rectal examination conducted by a physician's assistance during his initial medical examination. He ended his hunger strike when faced with the possibility of being force-fed. In keeping with standard practice for flight safety, al-Masri was restrained with flex cuffs, his eyes were covered, and he had noise suppression muffs over his ears. In consideration of CTC/RDG's request, however, al-Masri was not forced to wear a diaper (a sanitary measure for flight risks), and he was permitted to use the toilet and drink water. Al-Masri also did not wear the usual sweat clothes but wore civilian clothing specifically for him by CTC/RDG officers.

- On May 12, 2004, CIA Deputy Director McLaughlin, in closed [testimony](https://archive.org/details/may-12-2004-ddcia-testimony) corrected the record to Congress that CIA was not involved in any of the photos seen that leaked to the media, of unauthorised detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. He said, "We are not authorised in the program to do anything like what you have seen in those photographs." As noted by the Office of Medical Services (OMS) on the RDI program during their [review](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5301943/CIA-OMS-Summary.pdf), "The empirical record affirmed effectiveness and, through the presence of OMS, the safety of the program. Finally, critically and urgency  each received case-by-case analysis from CTC. Though imperfect this review nonetheless limited the application of EITs to less than a third of the detainees who came into Agency hands, and further limited the use of the most aggressive techniques to only 5 or 6 of the highest value detainees. A criterion  of"'necessity" also requires that no aggressive measure be used when a lesser measure would suffice."
  
- It has been alleged by several media outlets and NGOs that the CIA had several of the named individuals below in CIA custody, however, A [review](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20392756-savage-nyt-foia-redacted-durham-report-to-holder-on-cia-detainees-not-in-cia-custody) of FBI, CIA and DoD documents confirms none of these individuals were in CIA custody: Khalid Al-Zawahiri; Osama Bin Yousaf; Qari Saifullah Akhtar; Walid bin Azmi; Iban Al Yaquti al Sheikh al-Sufiyan; Amir Hussein Abdullah al-Misri; Safwan al-Hasham; Jawad al Bashar and Saif Al-Islam Al-Masri.

- Political pundits allege that the CIA deliberately destroyed 92 interrogation tapes to hide from accountability, for supposedly showing torture. This makes no sense logically with timelines of various events. It has also been alleged that Gina Haspel played a role in their destruction, and ran a blacksite. Both are not true.  On 30 Nov, 2002, an independent attorney viewed the video tapes, they examined logbooks, notebooks and other materials, and all other relevant material and confirmed that the cable traffic accurately described the, interrogation methods employed and that the methods conformed to the applicable legal and policy guidance. Destruction for the tapes, out of concern the footage or stills from the video, would be leaked online, with the faces of CIA personnel, putting them in danger, was approved on 8 Nov, 2005. By this time, however, the CIA's IG had already reviewed the footage, in 2003, and all cables, notes and other material. The IG found only 12 tapes contained footage of EIT use. 82 uses of waterboarding were identified, most lasting no more than 10 seconds. 11 tapes were blank aside from two tapes for 1-2 minutes. A review of the episode found, "no fault with the performance of Ms. Haspel. I have concluded that she acted appropriately in her role as Mr. Rodriguez's Chief of Staff... she drafted the cable on the direct orders of Mr. Rodriguez; she did not release that cable. It was not her decision to destroy the tapes; it was Mr Rodriguez's." He said his reason for the decision to destroy the tapes was due to the world's reaction of the photos concerning the rare, unauthorised detainee abuse by a few Military personnel at Abu Ghraib and that, "... never denied making the decision to destroy the tapes nor did he ever attempt to cover up his decision in any way. On the contrary, from day one Mr. Rodriguez admitted his decision and has been consistent in his explanation." However, there were some that remained, in the discovery process in the EDVA, 4th Cir of Appeals, two video tapes and one audio tape were found. For the purpose of the litigation, DOJ reviewed the tapes and provided transcripts to the Court, Ex Parte. Moussaoui was not mentioned in the tapes at all—thus irrelevant to the case—however, critically, they also independently found the cables describing the interrogations, and intelligence from them, match the tapes accurately: "At our request, CIA also provided us with intelligence cables pertaining to the interviews recorded on the two tapes. Because we reviewed these cables during our discovery review, we wanted to ensure that the cables accurately captured the substance of the interrogations. Based on our comparison of the cables to the videotapes, and keeping in mind that the cables were prepared for the purpose of disseminating intelligence, we found that the intelligence cables accurately summarized the substance of the interrogations in question."<sup>[1](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5673422-Gina-C-Haspel-CIA-Career-Timeline.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4414871/2011-02-15-Dkt-450-32-Exhibit-31.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://ia902503.us.archive.org/28/items/AZinterrogation/Document-04-CIA-Interrogation-of-Abu-Zubaydah.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4443609/Morell-Memo.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://ia601406.us.archive.org/33/items/cia04special_review/cia_2004special_review.pdf#page=43)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://coop.vaed.uscourts.gov/moussaoui/dktsheets/docs/72587/0.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[7](https://www.propublica.org/article/cia-cables-detail-its-new-deputy-directors-role-in-torture)</sup></sup>

- On the harshest technique, the waterboarding, it should be noted that the last use ended in March 2003, and only used on 3 detainees: KSM, Al Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah. Further, its use in reality and what mental pictures people develop when they hear of waterboarding are two very different things. The CIA crafted it carefully to fall well below the threshold of torture: the waterboard may be approved for use with a given detainee only during, at most, one single 30-day period, and that during that period, the waterboard technique may be used on no more than five days. In any 24-hour period, interrogators may use no more than two "sessions" of the waterboard on a subject—with a "session" defined to mean the time that the detainee is strapped to the waterboard—and that no session may last more than two hours. Moreover, during any session, the number of individual applications of water lasting 10 seconds or longer may not exceed six. As noted above the maximum length of any application of water is 40 seconds (this maximum has rarely been reached). Finally, the total cumulative time of all applications of whatever length in a 24-hour period may not exceed 12 minutes.<sup>[1](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/886271/download)</sup></sup>
 
#### Military Interrogations/detention, Guantanamo Bay:

- After interrogations under FM 34-52 failed, Major General Michael Dunlavey requested a number of counter-resistant [techniques](https://web.archive.org/web/20090714112912/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=7487) not within FM 34-52. These were broken down into [3 categories](https://web.archive.org/web/20090724080341/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jun2004/d20040622doc3.pdf). After extensive legal review, Cat 1 and 2 were approved. Only one Cat 3 was approved: Mild, non-injurious physical contact such as grabbing, poking in the chest with a finger, and light pushing. However, not even this was put into practice. Cat 2 approvals were rescinded before they could be used. Upon further legal review by an independent panel, only techniques that closely followed FM 34-52 were approved. Waterboarding didn't make it through the panel's review early on.<sup>[1](https://ia802504.us.archive.org/27/items/IG-Church-detainee-report/ChurchReport_text.pdf#page=11)</sup></sup> Some will be tempted to regurgitate the old talking-point that many former detainees at GTMO were never charged by the US—this is correct, however, that doesn't imply they weren't connected to terrorism, or otherwise involved in hostilities. The vast majority of GTMO's entire population were sent back to countries they were citizens of, to face their Courts at home. Many have been charged, and convicted in US Courts and Military Commissions with several before the SCOTUS.<sup>[2](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Guantanamo_Bay_Unclasssified_List_FINAL.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/detaineesFOIArelease15May2006.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2010/06/02/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf#page=28)</sup></sup>

- An authoritative paper found that, "The mental health providers at GTMO provide care in accordance with both the APA and American Psychiatric Association ethical guidelines. The standards set forth by the Geneva Conventions for both medical and mental health care are exceeded by the medical personnel at GTMO."<sup>[1](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-01792-001)</sup></sup>

- In October 2006, Sgt Heather Cerveny alleged that while drinking, 4 Sailors admitted to detainee abuse at GTMO. This was refuted by consistent testimony of the 4 individuals, among others, and particular allegations she made of where these people claimed to have worked at the facility, etc. Some areas were not yet built, or their station no where near detainees. In sum, she knew she made a fictitious story.<sup>[1](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/09-F-0049_BassettReport.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The 2005 IG [meta-analysis](https://archive.org/details/IG-Church-detainee-report/mode/2up) found, "Intelligence operations at GTMO are conducted in a highly-structured, well-disciplined environment that is conducive to intelligence collection.... much of the credit for the structure and discipline at GTMO is due to specific policies and procedures that have developed at GTMO over time, or what we refer to in shorthand as the GTMO "model." And, "As noted above, the first 19 techniques in the current policy were virtually identical to the techniques found in FM 34-54. Of the remaining remaining techniques, dietary manipulation simply consisted of feeding detainees military field rations; sleep adjustment did not entail depriving detainees of sleep, but rather adjusting their sleep cycles from night to day; and false flag involved the sort of nonviolent trickery or ruse that is inherent in many FM 34-52 techniques." It adds, "recent media reports have fuelled controversy over detainee treatment at GTMO, as several detainees (or their lawyers). have made claims of violent physical abuse and torture. For example, three Britons who were held for over two years at GTMO and then released - Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed - have claimed in a 115-page report released by their attorneys that they and other detainees were forcibly injected with drugs, brutally beaten and attacked by dogs. Another British detainee held at GTMO, Moazzam Begg, claimed in a letter released to his legal team that he had been subjected to beatings and “actual vindictive torture." A Yemeni and former chauffer for Usama Bin Ladin, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who is currently held at GTMO, has claimed in a lawsuit that he has been regularly beaten at GTMO. And two Australians held at GTMO, David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib (who has since’ been released), have also through their lawyers made widely-publicized claims of torture. Our review of medical. records found no evidence to support allegations of torture or violent physical abuse of detainees. In fact, detainees were more likely to suffer injury from playing soccer or volleyball during recreational periods than they were from interactions with interrogators or guards. Almost without exception, therefore, detainees at GTMO have been treated humanely." Lastly, We think it bears emphasis that the military leadership at GTMO has been and is making vigorous efforts to investigate all allegations of detainee abuse, whether the allegations come from DoD personnel, contractors, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), or the detainees themselves. Detainees have numerous channels available to report allegations of abuse: they can report allegations to military police, interrogators, linguists, medical personnel and chaplains. They also have opportunities to bring any concerns to the attention of the ICRC, which is a regular presence at GTMO that advocates on the detainees' behalf. In our view, the extremely low rate of abuse [3 minor infractions] at GTMO is largely due to strong command oversight, effective leadership, and adequate training on detainee handling and treatment. Additionally, those aspects of the GTMO "model" already discussed above—namely, a command organization that placed detention and intelligence operations under the command of a single entity, JTF-GTMO; effective coordination between interrogators and military police; adequate detention and interrogation resources; and well-developed standard operating procedures— have clearly played a role in keeping detainee abuse to a minimum. All of the closed, substantiated abuse cases are relatively minor in nature, and none bears any resemblance to the abuses depicted in the Abu Ghraib photographs. Almost without exception, therefore, detainees at GTMO have been treated humanely." 
  
- On June 9, 2005, an [investigation](https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/report/2005/d20050714report.pdf) into FBI allegations of detainee abuse concluded. After reviewing a _three-year_ period covering more than _24,000 interrogations_, Furlow and Schmidt identified _three_ interrogation acts that were never approved for use by the government. The investigation revealed no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at Guantanamo Bay. Interrogations were assessed, separately, to fall within bounds of US and International law, even those not approved, or were approved and never implemented.

- In early January of 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Order ordering the Secretary of Defense to "immediately undertake a review of the conditions of detention at Guantanamo to ensure full compliance with this directive." This report, submitted on 2/23/09, conforms with that order by setting out the conditions and conclusions: The Secretary of Defense tasked a special DoD team to review the conditions of confinement at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, to ensure all detainees there are being held “in conformity with all applicable laws governing the conditions of confinement, including Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions,” pursuant to the President’s Executive Order on Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities, dated January 22, 2009. The Review Team conducted 13 days of investigation on site that included more than 100 interviews with JTF-Guantánamo leadership, support staff, interrogators, and guards, multiple announced and unannounced inspections of all camps during daylight and night operations, reviewed numerous reports, video, discipline records, and observed many aspects of daily operations. Collectively, we talked to a number of detainees and observed detainee activities, including enteral feedings and interrogations. The review Team also solicited a sampling of opinion, studies, and published works, which reflected the perspective of detainees and other concerned interest groups, many with recommendations to improve detention conditions. This included our request for additional views from four organizations who wrote to the President concerning Guantánamo on January 30, 2009: Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International. These organizations responded to that request on February 6, 2009, and their submissions were carefully considered. After considerable deliberation and a comprehensive review, it is our judgment that the conditions of confinement in Guantánamo are in conformity with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2918343/Review-of-Department-Compliance-With-Presidents.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
  It is worth noting as well that even the least compliant detainees at Guantanamo Bay are provided with two to eight hours a day of recreation, quarterly meetings with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), ICRC messages, mail, skype, and phone access, Halal meals with several menu choices, prayer beads, prayer rugs, and other religious accommodations, as well as a library, 178 satellite TV stations, 79 satellite radio stations, classes, movies, and video games.<sup>[2](https://www.lawfareblog.com/federal-prosecution-viable-option-enemy-combatants)</sup></sup> Where hunger strike was concerned, the SOP was the following:

  A JMG medical provider will counsel the detainee who is on hunger strike as to the medical hazards of a prolonged period without food and/or water. The medical staff shall explain the medical risks faced by the detainee and make a reasonable effort to convince the detainee to resume eating food and drinking water.<sup>[3](https://www.aele.org/law/gitmo-force-feed.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- GTMO handling of the Koran. To respect the cultural and respect to Islam, GTMO issued SOPs that mitigated the likelihood of guards ever touching the Koran. "To ensure the safety of the detainees and guards while respecting the cultural dignity of the Korans thereby reducing the friction over the searching the Korans. JTF-GTMO personnel directly working with detainees will avoid handling or touching the detainee’s Koran whenever possible. When military necessity does require the Koran to be searched, the subsequent procedures will be followed: (1) The guard informs the detainee that the Chaplain or a Muslim interpreter will inspect Koran. If the detainee refuses the inspection at any time, the noncompliance is reported to the DOC and logged appropriately by the Block NCO. (2) The Koran will not be touched or handled by the guard. (3) The Chaplain or Muslim interpreter will give instructions to the detainee who will handle the Koran. He may or may not require a language specific interpreter. (4) The inspector is examining to notice unauthorized items, markings, or any indicators that raises suspicion about the contents of the Koran. (5) The inspector will instruct the detainee to first open the one cover with one hand while holding the Koran in the other thus exposing the inside cover completely. (6) The inspector instructs the detainee to open pages in an upright manner (as if reading the Koran). This is a random page search and not every page is to be turned. Pages will be turned slowly enough to clearly see the pages. (7) The inspector has the detainee show the inside of the back cover of the Koran. (8) The detainee is instructed to show both ends of the Koran while the book is closed so that inspector can note the binding while closed paying attention to abnormal contours or protrusions associated with the binding. The intent is to deduce if anything may be in the binding without forcing the detainee to expose the binding, which may be construed as culturally insensitive or offensive given the significance of the Koran. (9) How the detainee reacted, observation by other detainees, and other potentially relevant observations will be annotated in DIMS. 
  
  Handling. (1) Clean gloves will be put on in full view of the detainees prior to handling. (2) Two hands will be used at all times when handling the Koran in manner signaling respect and reverence. Care should be used so that the right hand is the primary one used to manipulateany part of the Koran due to the cultural association with the left hand. Handle the Koran as if it were a fragile piece of delicate art. (3) Ensure that the Koran is not placed in offensive areas such as the floor, near the toilet or sink, near the feet, or dirty/wet areas.
 Removal. (1) Korans must be transported by the detainee, in the event the detainee is moved to another cell or block. (2) If a Koran must be removed at the direction the CJDOG, the detainee library personnel, Muslim interpreter, or Chaplain will be contacted to retrieve and properly store the Koran in the detainee library. The request for the librarian, interpreter, or Chaplain, as well as the retrieval itself, will be logged in DIMS. (3) If the Chaplain, librarian, or Muslim interpreter, within the needs of the situation, cannot remove the Koran, then the guard may remove the Koran after approved by the DOC (who notes this in the DIMS) IAW the following procedures: (a) Clean gloves will be put on in full view of the detainees prior to handling. (b) Two hands will be used at all times when handling the Koran in manner signaling respect and reverence. (c) Place a clean, dry, detainee towel on the detainee bed and then place the Koran on top of the clean towel in a manner, which allows it to be wrapped without turning the Koran over at any time in a reverent manner. Ensure that the Koran is not placed in offensive areas such as the floor, near the toilet or sink, near the feet, or dirty/wet area when doing this activity. (4) How the detainee reacted, observation by other detainees, and other potentially relevant observations will be annotated appropriately in the DIMS significant activities menu. (5) The Koran shall be returned to the librarian, Chaplain, or DOC (in that order). (6) Korans are the property of the U.S. Government and as such will remain in the cells only to be removed at the CJDOG’s decision. (7) If a Koran is damaged or destroyed by a detainee, the chaplain in conjunction with a Muslim interpreter will take the Koran from the detainee for a minimum of ten days noted in DIMS. At that point, the chaplain can reissue the Koran to the detainee. The chaplain must ensure the block knows the Koran is being taken to protect the Koran, not punish the detainee.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20080530003553/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603-b.pdf)</sup></sup>
 
- In 2005, allegations that guards at GTMO mishandled/disrespected the Koran (Quran) were independently investigated by Jay Hood. The inquiry reviewed over three years worth of records, totalling 31,000 documents, both electronic and hard copy, including: sixty-three Habeas petitions, thirty-eight press articles, etc. While only 4 of these were confirmed, there were 15 confirmed cases of detainees mishandling the Quran. Further, contrary to allegations, the inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Koran down a toilet. However, a detainee did flush another detainee's in the toilet.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20050611060110/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603a.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20080530003534/http://www.voanews.com/mediaassets/english/2005_06/Other/pdf/PR050603.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- Nothing in the GTMO files from wikileaks shows any torture, or abuses—contrary to wikileaks and conspiracy theorist claims.<sup>[1](https://wikileaks.org/detaineepolicies/document/)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20060315035935/http://www.time.com/time/2006/log/log.pdf)</sup></sup>


#### Military Interrogations/detention, Abu Ghraib/Bagram:
- Unauthorised detainee abuse were already subject to independent investigations at Abu Ghraib and Bagram. It should be noted: That this was rare, done by a "small group of morally corrupt soldiers and civilians". Accountability was swift when thoroughly investigated. As noted in a comprehensive examination of detainee handling even as early as July 2004, there was no systemic abuse, or causes of abuse. The vast majority were in compliance with DoD standards for humane treatment and care. Some may be tempted to quote the Taguba report as evidence of "systemic abuse". However, this is folly. As used in the Taguba investigation, the term "systemic" deals with a subset of the security and interrogation operations at only one interment/resettlement facility and is not theater-wide. Further, MG Taguba testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on 11 May 04, narrowing the extent of the term “systemic” by stating that these particular abuses were individual actions not committed at the direction of the chain of command and that the resulting photos were taken with personal cameras. As an IG report independently finds, "Based on our review and analysis  of reports and case summaries of Investigations and our observations and interviews conducted throughout this inspection, we could not identify a systemic cause for the abuse incidents."<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/detainee-operations-inspection)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nationi/documents/fay_report_8-25-04.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- On September 23, 2009, an [independent](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Oct/31/2001836211/-1/-1/1/09-INTEL-13.PDF) investigation found that allegations that the DoD, between September 2001 to April 2008 was using "mind-altering drugs" on detainees to be unsubstantiated. Some detainees were medicated to treat diagnosed mental conditions. (also examines GTMO).

- On November 8, 2009, an [investigation](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/FormicaReportRelease.pdf) of US Special Forces at Abu Ghraib found that a number allegations of detainee abuse were unsubstantiated and contradicted by the evidence. In general, facilities met the standards under international law as well as US law and policy. It did discover some issues, and made recommendations for mandatory corrective training.

- On 4 November, 2004, a SEAL team captured Manadal al-Jamaidi, in Iraq. During capture, he resisted apprehension. During the onset of an interview with CIA, he slumped over and lost consciousness. He died shortly after. Counter to media claims, he was not subject to any CIA EITs or beatings while in custody. He died to due injuries that resulted during capture.<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/al-Jamaidi)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/cidal-jamaidi)</sup></sup>

- A CIA contractor, on June 21, 2003, beat to death Abdul Wali, at a US Military base. This was not part of the EIT program. Immediately after the death—the CID and CIA conducted independent, and thorough investigations—CIA made a criminal referral to DOJ, who prosecuted David Passaro. Passaro was convicted for the crime, and spent several years in prison.<sup>[1](https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nce/press/2004/2004-Jun-17.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/passaro-oig)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016180137/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/press-release-archive-2006/pr08172006.htm)</sup></sup>

- On December 10, 2002, a number of US Military personnel (20) were involved in [detainee abuse](https://archive.org/details/doddoacid-011770) that resulted in the death of two men, one of whom was Dilawar. CIA had no involvement in this matter. All men were convicted.

- By mid-2004, 155 investigations into detainee abuse allegations had been completed, resulting in 66 substantiated cases. An independent panel concluded, "No approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuses that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."<sup>[1](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/d20040824finalreport.pdf)</sup></sup>

 As for the leadership of Abu Ghraib, during the brief period of the rare, unauthorised detainee abuse, two independent investigations were conducted in 2005: One by the Army IG, the other by the Army's JAG Office. They examined 5 senior officers: Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, Maj. Gen. Walter Wojdakowski, Maj. Gen. Barbara G. Fast, Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, and Col. Marc Warren. To this end, the DAIG examined previously completed investigations, while conducting its own, more thorough review—it examined allegations of dereliction in the performance of duties pertaining to detention and interrogation operations, and improperly communicating interrogation policies. The DAIG found all these allegations unfounded, aside from two in the case of Karpinski. Allegation of shoplifting and dereliction were found substantiated. Though Karpinski’s performance of duty was found to be lacking in niche areas, the investigation determined that no action or lack of action on her part contributed specifically to the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib. The probe also found the allegation she did not punish those under her command unfounded, and that she strived to do so, when allegations arose. President Bush approved the recommendation to demote Karpinski to Colonel, and honourably discharged from service. The JAG's PSI cleared Col. Marc Warren.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413065842/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413195544/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Sanchez_IG_Report_pt2.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/fast_ig_report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://web.archive.org/web/20190309165139/https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Detainne_Related/Wojdakowski_IG_Report.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://archive.org/details/karpinski-daig)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://web.archive.org/web/20050510232110/http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=7293)</sup></sup>

 Lastly, the previously mentioned September 2005 Navy Inspector General, also known as the [Church report](https://archive.org/details/IG-Church-detainee-report) conducted a meta-study of all previous reviews, investigations of GTMO, Abu Ghraib, and elsewhere—as well as its own fresh investigation: "we examined the 187 DoD investigations of alleged detainee abuse that had been closed as of September 30, 2004. Of these investigations, 71 (or 38%) had resulted in a finding of substantiated detainee abuse, including six cases involving detainee deaths. 8 of the 71 cases occurred at GTMO, all of which were relatively minor in their physical nature. Additionally, 130 cases remained open, with investigations ongoing. Finally, our investigation indicated that commanders are making vigorous efforts to investigate every allegation of abuse—regardless of whether the allegations are made by DoD personnel, civilian contractors, detainees, the ICRC, the local populace, or any other source." One case was removed from this statistical report leaving it to just 70 substantiated. Of the 70, there were only 121 victims. Disciplinary action was taken against a total of 115 personnel. The investigation found no link between approved interrogation techniques and detainee abuse." The report also finds, "An early focus of our investigation was to determine whether DoD had promulgated interrogation policies or guidance that directed, sanctioned or encouraged the abuse of detainees. We found that this was not the case. While no universally accepted definition of "torture" or "abuse" exists, the theme that runs throughout the Geneva Conventions, international law and US military doctrine is that detainees must be treated "humanely." Moreover, the President, in his February 7, 2002 memorandum that determined that al Qaeda and the Taliban are not entitled to EPW protections under the Geneva Convention, reiterated the standard of "humane" treatment. We found, without exception,  that the DoD officials and senior military commanders responsible for the formulation of interrogation policy evidenced the intent to treat detainees humanely, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion that such officials or commanders ever  accepted that detainee abuse would be permissible. Even in the absence of precise definition of "humane" treatment, it is clear that none of the pictured abuse at Abu Ghraib bear any resemblance to approved policies at any level, in any theater. We note, therefore, that our conclusion is consistent with the Independent Panel, which in its August 2004 report determined that "no approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of abuse that in fact occurred. There is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military authorities."

- Claims that the United States invaded Afghanistan to control the poppy fields and protect the market have proven time and time again to be false, ignoring the US-led effort to destroy, disrupt and phase out poppy cultivation in the land, working with the Afghanistan Government and ISAF to reach this goal. This goal has had its ups and downs, and did work overall. While poppy production increased over the years; it stemmed from Taliban/AQ-controlled regions—not those controlled by the Government.<sup>[1](https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/inl/rls/other/102214.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://2001-2009.state.gov/documents/organization/90671.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/counternarcotics/index.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20171213_RL30588_0a51c51635f5c5fcd227fe6dc9d4dda135ef1aa4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://media.defense.gov/2007/Jul/01/2001712995/-1/-1/1/Counternarcotics_Pgr_Afghan%20_Final%20Rpt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/testimonies/witnesses/attachments/2016/02/02/01-15-14_dea_capra_testimony_re_future_us_counternarcotics_efforts_in_afghanistan_web_ready.pdf)</sup></sup>

- After the terrorist attack on 9/11, the US responded by sending in [small CIA/Special Forces teams](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf) into Afghanistan. They knew their enemy. "In CTC/SO, we operated on the understanding that the enemy was not Afghanistan, not the Afghan people, and not even the Taliban as a government institution. The enemy was al-Qaida, particularly the terrorists' command and control network and their specific Taliban leadership allies."
US later invaded Afghanistan. [Legal under US domestic & international law](https://archive.org/details/warinafghanistan85schm)
The US invaded Iraq because of its [non-compliance with UNSC Resolution 1441](https://archive.org/details/wariniraqlegalan86pedr)

- A 2003 [international group of experts](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1164_web.pdf), by the IAEA, reviewed sites in Kuwait in which Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions were used in the First Gulf War. The report finds:
  > "On the basis of the measurements carried out at the sites investigated in the IAEA’s study and summarized in this report, DU does not pose a radiological hazard to the population of Kuwait... Annual radiation doses that could arise from exposure to DU residues would be very low and of little radiological concern. Annual radiation doses in the areas where residues do exist would be of the order of a few microsieverts, well below the annual doses received by the population of Kuwait from the natural sources of radiation in the environment and far below the reference level recommended by the IAEA as a criterion to help establish whether remedial actions are necessary."

- The First Gulf War, the US liberated Kuwait from Iraq's illegal occupation, which was devastatingly effective, and in [full compliance with international law](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=638&skin=2021), as emphasis was placed on [reducing civilian casualties and collateral damage to infrastructure as much as possible](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=664&skin=2021) this includes the "highway of death". As the final report to Congress notes:
  >"In the early hours of 27 February, CENTCOM received a report that a concentration of vehicles was forming in Kuwait City. It was surmised that Iraqi forces were preparing to depart under the cover of darkness. CINCCENT was concerned about the redeployment of Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, fearing they could join with and provide reinforcements for Republican Guard units west of Kuwait City in an effort to stop the Coalition advance or otherwise endanger Coalition forces. The concentration of Iraqi military personnel and vehicles, including tanks, invited attack. CINCCENT decided against attack of the Iraqi forces in Kuwait City, since it could lead to substantial collateral damage to Kuwaiti civilian property and could cause surviving Iraqi units to decide to mount a defense from Kuwait City rather than depart. Iraqi units remaining in Kuwait City would cause the Coalition to engage in military operations in urban terrain, a form of fighting that is costly to attacker, defender, innocent civilians, and civilian objects.The decision was made to permit Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait City and engage them in the unpopulated area to the north. In the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm, some questions were raised regarding this attack, apparently on the supposition that the Iraqi force was retreating. The attack was entirely consistent with military doctrine and the law of war. The law of war permits the attack of enemy combatants and enemy equipment at any time, wherever located, whether advancing, retreating, or standing still. Retreat does not prevent further attack. At the small-unit level, for example, once an objective has been seized and the position consolidated, an attacking force is trained to fire upon the retreating enemy to discourage or prevent a counterattack." 
 
   It has also been alleged by conspiracy theorists that the US secretly gave the "greenlight" for Saddam to invade. This is a hoax. An examination of the record indicates the exact opposite: "The common assertion that Saddam perceived a 'green light' from Ambassador April Glaspie or other officials in the months prior to the invasion does not withstand serious scrutiny. In Glaspie’s July 25 meeting with Saddam, she assured her interlocutor of Washington’s desire for friendship and that the United States took no position on the merits of any of the (many) Arab-Arab border demarcation disputes. Taking a legal position on the proper border, Glaspie cabled Washington, would have “change[d] radically our policy.” Yet she also warned Saddam against trying to settle any dispute with Kuwait by force and told the Iraqi leader that the United States would “never excuse settlement of disputes by other than peaceful means”. Moreover, even if Glaspie had given Saddam a “green light” during this meeting, he would almost certainly not have taken this statement at face value given his abiding fear of American perfidy. Saddam smelled an American trap in nearly every initiative launched by Washington and nearly every geopolitical event affecting Iraq. Why would he have now believed that the United States would allow him to dominate the Gulf when it had so assiduously worked to prevent either Iraq or Iran from doing so during the 1980s? We have found nothing in the captured Iraqi documents or recordings indicating that Saddam or his principal advisers perceived a “green light” to invade Kuwait. In fact, the captured documents point in the opposite direction. In the period preceding the invasion, Iraqi officials regularly stated that invading Kuwait would entail a military confrontation with the United States. In 1989, the GMID assessed that Schwarzkopf’s recent visit to Kuwait revealed that 'America has pledged to defend the Gulf States, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to protect them from any aggression they might encounter.' In July 1990, the same agency concluded that, in the event of an Iraqi invasion, Kuwait would receive military support from the United States and potentially from other countries as well. Saddam apparently agreed with this assessment. In a conversation with his advisers shortly after the invasion, he claimed that before invading Kuwait, the Iraqi leadership had taken into account that the United States might retaliate with “a complete boycott” and 'strike us in the air, land, and sea—everywhere.' Saddam did not expect forbearance from a country he considered an aggressive imperial power; he expected conflict." Lastly as Brands points out, "There is one piece of evidence that merits special mention in this regard – a memo written by President Reagan’s first secretary of state, Alexander Haig, following a trip to the Middle East in April 1981. Summarising his conversations in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, Haig wrote, ‘It was also interesting to confirm that President Carter gave the Iraqis a green light to launch the war against Iran through [Crown Prince] Fahd [of Saudi Arabia].’ Although this document is often taken as confirmation of the green light thesis, the actual meaning of the Haig memo remains murky. As the full context of the document indicates, Haig’s comment about a ‘green light’ was not made as an admission by a US official with direct knowledge of any such scheme – Haig had not been in government in September 1980 – but rather as his characterisation of information reported to him by one of his Arab interlocutors (which interlocutor is not clear). The Haig memo therefore provides hard evidence only of the fact that one of the secretary’s sources believed the green light thesis to be true. Haig himself does not seem to have attached a great deal of importance to this assertion – his memo mentions the seemingly explosive issue only once, in a single sentence, before proceeding to other matters."<sup>[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7709.2012.01045.x)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14682745.2011.564612)</sup></sup>

- During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), [U.S. military](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112004365182&view=2up&seq=649&skin=2021&q1=Al%20Firdus%20bunker) planners identified Al Firdos C3 Bunker (Amiriyah shelter),  as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters.  The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths.  Was there a violation of the LOAC?  Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces.  Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective. Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made. A review of the targeting policies at the time were determined to be proper. 

- January 1991, it was alleged that USS Nicholas engaged Iraqis on oil platforms who were showing white flags to surrender. This was the case for only a handful of Iraqi personnel who were next to others brandishing weapons at recon helicopters, who were also armed with Surface-to-air missiles and AA Guns. The following day, when the helicopters returned, no white flags were seen, and the demonstrated hostile intent was clear. The USS Nicholas engaged under strict Rules of Engagement and applicable international law.<sup>[1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44642452.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A35a8f6a42d0569530172e517dcbd6724)</sup></sup>

- In 1991, the United States and allied countries [under UNSCR resolution & strict Rules of Engagement](https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1459&context=ils), imposed 3 no-fly zone operations to secure the Kurdish people from slaughter at the hands of the brutal Iraqi regime. This measure allowed the Allied nations to also provide humanitarian aid. 

- In August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s army invaded Kuwait and consequently the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq.
Saddam lied about the effect of these sanctions, by manipulating census data. A [paper](https://gh.bmj.com/content/2/2/e000311) published in BMJ Global Health confirms, "Since 2003, however, several more surveys dealing with child mortality have been undertaken. Their results show no sign of a huge and enduring rise in the under-5 death rate starting in 1991. It is therefore clear that Saddam Hussein’s government successfully manipulated the 1999 survey in order to convey a very false impression—something that is surely deserving of greater recognition."

- In 1988, a US Navy ship accidentally shot down civilian airline flight 655. An [independent investigation](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6660400-1988-Iran-Plane-Crash-Fp.html#document/p1) determined that Iran was at fault for the tragedy. Its actions that day led to the incident. "On the morning of 3 July, MONTGOMERY observed seven IRGC small boats approaching a Pakistani vessel. The number shortly thereafter grew to 13 and they began to challenge nearby merchantmen. VINCENNES was ordered to the area to support MONTGOMERY and launched a helicopter to reconnoiter the scene. In the progress the helicopter was fired upon. VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY closed the general areas of the small boats. Two of the boats turned toward  VINCENNES  and MONTGOMERY while the others began to manoeuvre erratically. These actions were interpreted as manifesting hostile intent and both ships, after being given permission, engaged. This action, involving high speed course changes and gunfire at close range, was still in progress when Air Bus 655 took off from the joint military/civilian airfield at Bandar Abbas and headed toward Dubai. It is hard to overemphasize the fact that Bandar Abbas is also a military airfield. The Air Bus was probable not informed of the surface action taking place in the Strait. Informed or not, Flight 655 logically appeared to have a direct relationship to the ongoing surface engagement.

  During the critical seven minutes that Flight 655 was airborne, Captain Rogers and his CIC Watch team were integrating a multitude of ongoing events. Specifically, VINCENNES was engaged in a high-speed surface battle with at least two groups of Iranian small boasts—all of which had the capability to inflict serious damage. At the same time, she was monitoring one of her helos which was airborne and had already come under attack.  CIC was also tracking an Iranian P-3 military aircraft airborne approximately 60 nautical miles to the northwest which was presenting a classic  targeting profile. (i.e., furnishing information to an attack aircraft.) In the midst of this highly charged environment, an unknown aircraft took off from a joint military/civilian airport on a flight path headed directly toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. This was the same airfield from which Iran had launched F-4s in support of an attack on US naval forces on 18 April. This unknown aircraft was 27 minutes behind any scheduled commercial airline departure from Bandar Abbas airport. Although it was flying within a known commercial air corridor, it was off centerline some 3 or 4 miles, which was not the usual centerline profile for commercial air traffic previously monitored by VINCENNES. Moreover, its mid-range altitude was consistent with either a hostile or commerical aircraft. VINCENNES could detect no radar emanations from the contact which might identify it, but was reading a Mode III IFF squawk. This situation was confused somewhat when a Mode II IFF squawk was detected and the aircraft was identified as an F-14. Complicating the picture was an Iranian P-3 to the west which was in excellent position to furnish targeting information to an attacking aircraft. More importantly, the unknown contact continued at a gradually increasing speed on a course headed toward VINCENNES and MONTGOMERY. It failed to respond to repeated challenges from VINCENNES over both military and international emergency distress frequencies.
  
- It has been alleged, that through "Operation Cyclone", the US funded/trained terrorist groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, under the umbrella of the Mujahidin—thus also, creating Bin Laden—to combat the illegal Soviet invasion and occupation on Afghanistan. 
This is a distortion of reality, and is often misunderstood.
While it is true the CIA did aid the Mujahidin, they did so only to moderate factions, under strict vetting for human rights compliance & religious views. These moderates, would be known as the Northern Alliance after the Soviet invasion ended. They fought against AQ and Taliban extremists in the 90s, with US assistance. 
Ultimately, the US reached out again to the Northern Alliance after the events of 9/11, to go after the terrorist groups.

  CIA had 0 contact or relationship of Bin Laden during the 80s. Indeed, it is the Soviet's illegal invasion of Afghanistan that created Bin Laden. He used his wealth to fund and supply the Afghan Arabs in the Mujahidin.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/static/c40e6e16c1183e0bed3777f048f41d98/Devotion-to-Duty.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20191101205458/https://www.cia.gov/news-information/cia-the-war-on-terrorism/terrorism-faqs.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.cia.gov/static/9fa9520134e1c2f3068001de69c9964b/Curator-Pocket-History-CIA.pdf#page=86)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-041-doc01.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
- In May 1985, a Washington Post article alleged CIA had an indirect role of a car bombing incident in Lebanon in March of that same year. 
 CIA reviewed the matter after examining all files and personnel, and concluded no such connection or foreknowledge existed. This was independently verified by a House Intel Committee investigation. 
   - "The Committee's review has uncovered no evidence that any US Intelligence Agency — any US Government Agency — has encouraged or participated in any terrorist activity in Lebanon. Further, the Committee was able to discover no evidence that any US Intelligence agency had foreknowledge of the March 8 bombing outside the residence of Sheik Hussein Fadlallah.
   - Its review of relevant documents and files and its interview of appropriate government officials leads to the conclusion that no US Government complicity, direct or indirect, can be established with respect to the March 8 bombing in Beirut."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91-00587R000100720055-4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90-00965R000807590013-2.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- In 1980s, US had no involvement in the Turkish coup. According to the list's own wiki citation, the alleged source for the claim clarified in a June 2003 interview, "I did not say to Carter "Our boys did it." It is totally a tale, a myth, It is something Birand fabricated. He knows it, too. I talked to him about it." And, "General Kenan Evren said 'the US did not have pre-knowledge of the coup but we informed them of the coup 2 hours in advance due to our soldiers coinciding with the American community JUSMAT that is in Ankara.'" 

- Political pundits and conspiracy theorists claim that the CIA was meddling in Afghanistan prior to the Soviets, in 1979. However, declassified documents in the landmark series, 'Foreign Relations of the United States, 1977–1980, Volume XII, Afghanistan' confirms this to be a still-believed case of Kremlin fake news from the period. While the US did get involved, technically, before the illegal, imperialistic invasion, these actions were only in response to Soviet's covert actions, that were preparing for the invasion. These actions were only intelligence collection and assistance such as food, water, clothing, medical supplies, and propaganda were provided. "U.S. policy in response to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, a process that began with Moscow’s growing involvement in Afghan politics following the Communist revolution in April 1978 and culminating with the mass influx of Soviet military forces in December 1979. Until the Communist coup that overthrew President Mohammed Daoud Khan, U.S. diplomatic and strategic interest in Afghanistan was minor, and focused largely on stanching the flow of illegal narcotics through that country. Prior to 1978, Washington viewed Afghanistan as a relatively stable and non-aligned country that did not figure prominently in the global Cold War competition. Accordingly, Afghanistan was not a major focal point for the first year and a half of the Carter administration. By 1978, at the first sign that Afghanistan may fall into the Soviet orbit, Washington’s interest in Afghanistan increased dramatically." It goes on to detail how the US Government responded to the Kremlin's propaganda, that projected its actions onto the US, "On March 30, 1979, the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs, Zbigniew Brzezinski, informed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that he had sent memoranda to the International Communication Agency (ICA) and the CIA relaying how President Jimmy Carter wanted to respond to Soviet allegations that the United States was meddling in Afghan affairs. (See Document 43.) Brzezinski’s memorandum to Director of Central Intelligence Stansfield Turner, March 30, transmitted Carter’s request to strongly rebuke the Soviet allegation of U.S. involvement in overthrowing the Afghan Government. Brzezinski went on: “All information available to us in recent days has tended to indicate quite the contrary: that the Soviet Union is preparing to intervene in Afghanistan to prop up an unpopular leftist regime and is, in fact, already doing most of the things it is accusing the United States and other countries of doing or preparing to do.” Brzezinski requested a status report by April 6 in response to Carter’s directive." Other documents note, "CIA representatives have been instructed not to delve too deeply with Afghan sources into the theoretical possibility of clandestine support for the rebels, for fear of giving them false signals regarding U.S. intentions."<sup>[1](https://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1977-80v12/pdf/frus1977-80v12.pdf#page=8)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3093334?origin=crossref)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20210928211944/https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000278538.pdf)</sup></sup>

  It is further alleged, that the Carter administration tricked, and trapped Moscow in a Vietnam-style quagmire. The often cited "smoking-gun" evidence for this claim, comes from an interview with French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur in January 1998, former U.S. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. However, a careful, thorough, and incisive 2020 study reveals this is nothing more than a myth, contradicted by declassified documents, and other critical source examination. "The French interview has had a major impact on the historiography, being used as the almost sole basis to prove the existence of a concerted effort to lure Moscow into the “Afghan trap.” There are, however, significant problems with it as an historical source. First, the title is deceptive. It reads (in translation): “The revelations of a former adviser to Carter: ‘Yes, the CIA came into Afghanistan before the Russians . . .’” Quotation marks and ellipsis indicate that this is a direct quote from Brzezinski and implies CIA operations inside Afghanistan before December 1979, which does not fit with the historical record. Although insisting on the accuracy of the interview, the journalist has since conceded that the quote in the title was not actually from Brzezinski but was “invented” by the editors, which casts doubt on the subsequent text.6 Secondly, the published remarks were heavily edited and Brzezinski has denied the article’s accuracy on numerous occasions, asserting that it was “not an interview, but excerpts from an interview that was originally supposed to be published in full but which they never checked with me for approval in the form that it did appear.”7 It is also likely a casualty of translation—being conducted in English, translated and printed in French, and reconverted to English—with the original statements becoming skewed and distorted in their edited and translated form. Additionally, many of the interview’s claims are unsupported by documentary evidence. For example, Brzezinski has denied he ever sent a note claiming the covert aid would “lead to a Soviet military intervention,” and no such note, nor references to it, has ever been found. Nowhere else has Brzezinski ever referred to a systematic plan for the “Afghan trap” and neither in his subsequent actions, writings, interviews, or public remarks on the topic has he shown any satisfaction that his strategy had worked. It is highly questionable that Brzezinski would attempt to bolster his reputation and disclose information on a secret plan to ensnare Moscow in an Afghan quagmire in just one foreign interview and then subsequently and repeatedly deny it. The editing, translation, inventions, and lack of final approval and corroborating documentation generates doubts on the accuracy of the words attributed to Brzezinski and, ultimately, if this one unreliable interview is discounted there is very little legitimate evidence to back up the “trap” thesis. The nascent covert program was a consequence of the Soviets’ “creeping intervention,” not its cause, and carefully calibrated to avoid provoking an invasion. Brzezinski’s actions through 1979 demonstrated an effort to dissuade intervention through publicizing the growing Soviet presence and warning directly of the consequences of intervention, and his post-invasion actions belie the argument that bogging down the Soviets in an unrelenting insurgency was his objective. The limited pre-invasion covert program is wholly insignificant to charge the Carter administration with actively attempting to induce an invasion, and thus causing the subsequent decades of destabilization in Afghanistan. It is, as Mondale wrote, “a huge, unwarranted leap to conclude that the CIA plan was designed to provoke a Soviet intervention when we were, in fact, trying to discourage one."<sup>[4](https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/44/2/237/5699276?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the US Government sold out, and abandoned the Kurds in 1975. However, a critical review of the declassified records finds no basis in this charge. As one world-renowned scholar Bryan Gibson, "Despite the widely held view that the United States sold the Kurds out in March 1975, the decision was presented as a fait accompli. While Kissinger had known that the Shah was considering abandoning the Kurds, he believed that he had talked him out of it. At least, this was the thrust of Kissinger’s letter to Barzani in February 1975, when he agreed to meet with a Kurdish emissary. Nevertheless, Kissinger saw the Kurdish intervention as a valuable means of advancing US Middle Eastern strategy. After all, the Kurdish intervention had tied down Iraq’s army during the October War, allowed Kissinger to secure Israel’s disengagement from Syria, and prevented the formation of a strong Iraqi government. In the end, Kissinger’s frustration upon learning that the Shah had ignored his advice and had reached agreement with Saddam Hussein in Algiers is explained by his belief that the Kurds were a valuable Cold War card, to be used to advance US interests, while denying the Soviet Union a strong base of influence. This study shows that both the Pike Report and William Safire’s highly critical articles have had a distorting effect on the historiographical discourse on the Kurdish War. The primary objective of the US operation was to increase the Kurds’ bargaining power with Baghdad in order to help them secure reasonable terms on autonomy. Nevertheless, both the Pike Report and Safire’s articles do not represent an objective assessment of the Ford administration’s handling of the Kurdish intervention. This study has shown that the Pike Report ignored inconvenient truths; manipulated evidence; misattributed quotes; falsely accused the United States of not providing the Kurds with any humanitarian assistance;  and, finally, claimed that Kissinger had not responded to Barzani’s tragic plea,  when in fact he had. None of these claims appeared to be substantiated. As Gerald Haines argues, the Pike Report’s real purpose was to expose the CIA as a “rogue elephant” and scale back the White House’s control over foreign policy.11 In other words, this was not the “textbook case of betrayal and skullduggery” that the Pike Report had led many people to believe."<sup>[1](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137517159)</sup></sup>

- During the 1974 Cyprus crisis, Nixon issued a last-ditch diplomatic effort via a stern warning letter to the Turkish Government to prevent an invasion of Cyprus. This letter reflected that of the Lyndon B. Johnson letter that prevented the invasion in 1964. However, the Ambassador to Turkey did not transmit the letter to Turkey. A study finds, "In his own approach to Turkey, though, Kissinger wanted to appeal to reason rather than fear. He mainly sought to deconstruct the Turkish assumption that the military solution would leave Turkey better off in Cyprus."<sup>[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2021.1935293)</sup></sup>

- Despite many allegations, no evidence exists that the US supported either or both sides of the Iran-Iraq conflict.
It is [confirmed](https://web.archive.org/web/20170124020754/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90T01298R000300670001-8.pdf) that the USSR was a major supplier for chemical agents and other gear to Iraq. The US led the global embargo effort against Iraq to prevent it from acquiring chemical weapons. CIA only, naturally, [monitored](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP81B00401R000500030002-5.pdf) the conflict—it is after all—the _Central Intelligence Agency_. On the Iran/Contra story, the US replaced Israel's 500 TOW missiles they sent to Iran, in exchange for Iran to pressure Hezbollah to release US hostages. The US maintained its arms embargo on Iran throughout the conflict, in its stance of neutrality. Reagan repeatedly asked for assurances that this wouldn't upset the balance between Iran and Iraq.<sup>[1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015014946043&view=2up&seq=39&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702452-Iran-Contra-Minority-Report)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-bruemmer-silverberg.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-turner.pdf)</sup></sup>

- CIA had no involvement in Saddam's rise to power. According to the world's leading examination, "the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA was not behind the February 1963 Ba’thist coup." As Gibson Finds, "While it has been suggested that the United States instigated the revolt to undermine the Qasim regime, evidence shows the opposite. The Shelepin memo suggests that the Soviets had hoped to use Iraq’s Kurdish minority to distract the United States and its allies from the Berlin Crisis by threatening America’s regional allies, Iran and Turkey, both of which had large Kurdish minorities. In reality, the origins of the revolt were largely indigenous, relating mostly to Qasim’s failed land reforms and his divide-and-rule tactics." Other scholars like Peter Hahn observes that "no declassified US documents support this claim". In concluding, Gibson says, "the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA was not behind the February 1963 Ba’thist coup."

  It is also alleged that the CIA provided lists of communists and leftists to the Ba’th Party in the early 60s. Hanna Batatu, a Palestinian Marxist historian finds the Ba’th had “ample opportunity to gather such particulars in 1958–59, when the Communists came wholly into the open." Gibson and others concur, "This explanation actually makes perfect sense and is supported by documents that suggest the Ba’th Party had created its own lists during 1958–59. For instance, an INR analysis from February 15 stated, '[Communist] party members [are being] rounded up on the basis of lists prepared by the now-dominant Ba’th Party.' A separate INR analysis from February 21 pointed out that during the 1958–59 period, the communists had “exposed virtually all its assets” whom the Ba’th had “carefully spotted and listed.”<sup>[1](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137517159)</sup></sup>
  
- US had no involvement in the Suez crisis of 1956. To quote from an authoritative, independent internal study, "Without American support or knowledge, two staunch U.S. allies, in collusion with Israel, plotted to go to war for a cause the Eisenhower administration believed was rash, unjustified, and potentially very dangerous. Ultimately, France, Britain, and Israel would become the overt aggressors against Egypt. As a result, the United States was in the awkward position of siding with Nasser against its allies."<sup>[1](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2013-117-doc01.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/suez)</sup></sup>


- 1953, Iran. The list [claims](https://imgur.com/a/ZckJs0s) that the CIA "replaced" Mossadeq with the Shah. It should be obviously clear why this is a display of full ignorance: Who appointed him? This requires a concise, though lengthy (as much as it can be) summary of events leading to Ajax, to correct a number of myths:
After Iran's Prime Minister, Ali Razmara, was assassinated by an Islamic fundamentalist, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlav appointed Mossadeq as Prime Minister on 29 April 1951. He was never "democratically elected".
For Mossadeq, control over the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), became a main concern. Only a few years prior, the Shah renewed the concession in 1949. Mossadeq put down legislation, passing into law, that nationalised the company. The British owned half of AIOC's stock, and did not want its assets nationalised without  adequate compensation as required under International law.

  The British submitted an application to the ICJ, and used other means of negotiating with the Iranian Government. Reaching a stalemate, the British leveraged economic sanctions and even projected its Naval forces to intimidate Mossadeq into upholding international legal requirements on compensation. This line of action also failed. 

  While Mossadeq was dealing with the British, he was also engaged in internal affairs, a struggle for more power. He became greedy. A steady decline to dictatorship.
In 1952, Mossadeq "resigned" after dispute with the Shah on who could appoint the Minister of War. Constitutionally, legally, this rested with the Shah. The Prime Minister wanted to appoint himself as the Minister of War. Mossadeq's political move was to appeal to the public, accusing the Shah of violating the Constitution. The irony, it was he who was doing so. 
The Shah appointed Ahmad Qavam as the Next Prime Minister. The National Front led demonstrations to demand Mossadeq return, leading to violent clashes. 69 deaths, over 700 injured. The Shah refused to use Police or the Military to restore order. 5 days later, the Shah gave in, appointing Mossadeq as PM.

  Once he returned to office, he quickly consolidated power. 
 He appointed himself Minister of War, forced the Shah's twin sister Princess Ashraf to leave the country, and forbade
 Mohammed Reza Pahlavi from communicating directly with foreign diplomats—among other power grabs. The growth in Mossadeq's dictatorship became too much for the National Front, with many of its key figures turned against the Prime Minister, comparing him to Hitler. His ever increasing power alienated most of Iran's Parliament. Eventually, only the Tudeh were left supporting Mossadeq. This lead to deadlock in the Majlis. 
The solution to the deadlock became apparent to Mossadeq: Dissolve the Majlis. The problem: Only the Shah had the Constitutional authority. 

  Mossadeq devised a plan to go around this legal dead-end: Asking what supporters he had to resign, appeal to the public to force the rest to resign. Then, hold a referendum for the public to support or reject his course of action, arguing that the people's will superseded the Constitution. Iranian scholar Ervand Abrahamian has noted the irony in Mossadeq's rationale. "Mossadeq, the constitutional lawyer who had meticulously quoted the fundamental laws against the shah," Abrahamian wrote, "was now bypassing the same laws and resorting to the theory of the general will. 
The problem: Mossadeq rigged the vote, because he knew he could not win on this unconstitutional act. He purposefully excluded rural areas from the balloting. The ballot was not secret. Ayatollah Kashani also declared the referendum illegal under Islamic religious law.

  Returning back to the international stage:

  Mossadeq turns to the United States to support his struggle against the British. On this matter, the US was sympathetic, pressuring the British to further pursue diplomatic efforts. The British turned to the idea of using its military forces to occupy some ports. The further concern is that this would lead to Russia supporting a coup with the Tudeh. The Truman administration let the UK know the US opposed any military action against Iran. This worked.

  The view from the US and UK:

  As of 30 July 1952, the State Department and CIA were committed to
supporting Mossadeq. That evening, CIA representatives met at the State Department
with Secretary of State Acheson, Under Secretary of State David K.E. Bruce, Charles
Bohlen, Henry Byroade, John Jernegan, and Robert Joyce, all of the State Department.
The participants decided that "It is the policy of the Department of State to maintain the
present government in Iran so long as this government has the authority to govern, or
until it appears certain that the government will be taken over by the Communists."

  When Eisenhower came into officer, the internal struggle for power in Iran was disintegrating. The CIA's assessment boiled down to that if a showdown developed between the Shah's factions, and Mossadeq's, it would be the Tudeh that would come out on top, backed with the KGB's extensive penetration of the group. While small, they were well organised. As the US' view on the situation changed with internal power struggle between the Shah and the dictator, Mossadeq—Eisenhower approved Ajax. The CIA's involvement.

  Ajax:
 the CIA convinced the Shah to sign the firmans, resolving this matter by declaring that Mossadeq was no longer PM. Ajax was an exercise of the Shah's constitutional prerogative and authority. Mossadeq's failure to abide by the firmans would make his tenure as Prime Minister illegal. Zahedi was appointed the new, legal Prime Minister. 
  CIA kicked off a small demonstration in Tehran. This exploded. The people sided with the Shah, and the legal PM.

  In short:
 
  "Did the CIA act against a legitimate leader enjoying popular support?
  Although there is no doubt that Mossadeq captured the imagination of segments of Iranian society with the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, his political support dwindled steadily. By August 1953 he did not command mass support. The Tudeh and splinters of the National Front were the only political parties willing to support him. The pro-Shah sentiments of the Tehran crowds on 19 August 1953 were genuine. Although CIA had a hand in starting the demonstrations, they swelled spontaneously and took on a life of their own that surprised even Kermit Roosevelt. By August 1953, Mossadeq's support was vociferous but increasingly narrow. The Shah's support was latent but deep, and took a crisis—like the news of Tudeh demonstrators pulling down the Shah's statutes—to awaken. Khorramabad residents, for example, wildly rejoiced at hearing of the monarch's return. Before dismissing reports like those from  Khorramabad as propaganda, it must be remembered that CIA was able to influence directly events only in the capital city, and there only barely. Kermit Roosevelt had neither the money nor the agents to initiate the kinds of demonstrations that took place in Iran's widely separated cities.

  Did CIA restore the Shah to his throne? 
  TPAJAX did not "restore" the Shah to his throne either technically or constitutionally. Although the Iranian monarch left Tehran during the operation, he never abdicated. Mossadeq's argument that the Shah's _firmans_ were invalid was disingenuous. The Iranian constitution gave the Shah the right to dismiss the Prime Minister. As soon as Mossadeq refused to obey the Shah's legal order, he was rebelling against constitutional authority. From that point on, TPAJAX became an operation to remove the usurper Mossadeq and permit Zahedi, the legitimate Prime Minister, to take office. Unlike Mossadeq's government, Zahedi's government recognized the Shah's constitutional authority." 
  
  Was TPAJAX Responsible for Khomeini's Islamic Revolution?
   Revisionists contend that CIA stifled Iran's drive to democracy and strengthened the rule of the autocratic Shah, thereby making Khomeini's revolution all but inevitable. Despite its faults, in this view, Mossadeq's Government represented the popular will. His government reflected a vision for Iran's future that the Shah did not share. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi wanted to transform Iran into a modern Westernized state; his people preferred a more traditional society. In removing Mossadeq, the revisionists continue, the United States and Britain effectively strangled traditional Iranian nationalism. Frustrated and resentful, the people rose 25 years later in rage against the Shah and the United States, disparaged as the "Great Satan." For there can be no doubt that despite years of official American and British denials, most Iranians have been convinced of the CIA's rote in Mossadeq's fall.
   
   A problem with this thesis is that Mossadeq's Iran was not moving toward democracy. The Prime Minister's increasing political isolation and the fragmentation of the National Front, as documented above, had weakened his position and made him desperate. His dictatorial grab for power from the Majlis alienated his former allies and gained him new political enemies. Iran was, to repeat Iran specialist Kuross Samii' s apt metaphor, "an old ship swept away by a storm with no one on board capable of dealing with the attendant frenzy." In fact, Khomeini's revolution was a reaction against secularism,
modernization, and the Shah's misrule, not a push for a return to the National Front. The streets of Tehran rang with shouts of fanatical support for Khomeini rather than nostalgic calls for Mossadeq. The Ayatollah was not interested in Mossadeq or the things he stood for. The last thing Khomeini wanted was a secular government with multi-party participation. He would have called for fundamentalist revolution against any government, including a National Front or Tudeh Government, that promoted modernization, the emancipation of women, and secularization.
  
  Edward Shirley, the former CIA DO employee who journeyed through revolutionary Iran, argues that the revisionist thesis also underestimates the role the
clerics played in TPAJAX. Without the support of Ayatollahs Kashani and Behbehani, Shirley doubts the covert political action could have succeeded. What the ayatollahs did in 1953 with American and British help, they might have been able to do later without such help. Alternatively, given Mossadeq's growing political weakness and isolation from Iranian society, the clerics may have defeated him and the National Front in general elections. 
In short, according to Shirley, the 1953 aborted-democracy theory is appealing, but is "too convenient in its diabolization of the CIA and MI6, and too Persian in its determination to make someone else responsible for failure."<sup>[1](https://ia600106.us.archive.org/12/items/Zendebad-Shah-Iran-Coup-1953/Zendebad-Shah.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://ia601204.us.archive.org/14/items/TheBattleForIran/The%20Battle%20for%20Iran.pdf)</sup></sup>

- On 11 April, 2002, there was a coup attempted on Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, who was losing popularity and support due to many economic failures under his regime.<sup>[1](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2007-042-doc1.pdf)</sup></sup> Historical revisionists allege the CIA was involved in this coup attempt. However, several declassified documents confirm "that the US will not support any extraconstitutional moves to oust Chavez" and that these warnings "probably have given pause to the plotters."<sup>[2](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2007-044-doc1.pdf)</sup></sup> An independent State Department Inspector General reviewed these allegations, and found 0 basis for the charge. Indeed, it finds, "far from working to foment his overthrow, the United States alerted President Chávez to coup plots and warmed him of an assassination threat that was deemed to be credible"<sup>[3](https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/13682.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Between 1946-2000, contrary to many pundits, conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists claims—the US Army's School of Americas taught Caribbean, Central and South American countries on sound and relevant military doctrine; promoted democratic values; a respect for civilian government control, and respect for human rights among multinational forces. Every student receives the following human rights training: definition of concepts; the historical development of conventions and declarations; civilian control of the armed forces; the role of those forces in a democracy; and the military advantage for complying with human rights and the Law of Armed Conflict. As part of its internal evaluation process, the SOA requires all students to discuss the effects of human rights instruction in their course critiques. Students are required to describe how SOA instruction in human rights, democratization, civil control of the military, and military justice affected them and how the instruction may have changed any previously held views." All students are screened for criminal and human rights abuses. Countries with poor respect for human rights were prohibited from sending people to SOA.
 
  Several reviews conducted in the 1990s confirm the commendable effort of SOA: A Government Accountability Office report finds SOA training, "is intended to provide a long-term investment in a positive relationship with Latin America. The SOA courses emphasize the protection of human rights." A Board of Visitors report in 1996 found "SOA fulfils a need in providing instruction on civilian control, democratic values and human rights." A TRADOC Task Force report in 1994 finds, "the nomination & selection process of SOA cadre and students is sound. Less than 1 percent of all SOA graduates are alleged to have committed crimes or human rights violations. There is no evidence that indicates that the SOA courses influenced alleged behavior. The SOA program for human rights training is the most comprehensive and well-developed program in the US Army." It goes on, "However, there are cases where a heightened awareness and further scrutiny are needed. These cases occur most often in connection with specific information developed by the Embassy and reported to Washington. Examples include the troubled human rights record of security forces in Indonesia, colombia, and Turkey. In such cases, our assistance to the police and military is carefully vetted with the appropriate bureaus in the State Department to ensure that no training or materiel is provided to units where there is credible evidence they have been involved in the commission of gross violations of human rights. On a few occasions, evidence of gross human rights violations has required a complete reappraisal of U.S. training activities in a specific country. In Indonesia, for example, DoD cancelled the JCET program in May 1998 and has not resumed the program. Currently, U.S. military training with the Indonesian military is limited to a small program of humanitarian, engineering, and medical activities. In addition, a mobile team will provide training in human rights awareness and civil-military relations. There is no training by the U.S military for the Indonesian military in lethal military skills, nor is any contemplated. In the case of Colombia, approval for training activities involves a two-phased screening process by our Embassy's country team. All individuals or units selected to receive training are carefully vetted by the Embassy for criminal, human rights, or narcotics violations. This applies whether the planned training is in-country or in the U.S. Additionally, through a 1997 End-Use Monitoring agreement with the Government of Colombia, indigenous sources of information (e.g., criminal records) are reviewed and then double-checked against U.S. Government records before training is approved. In fact several training activities have recently been cancelled or delayed due to the rigorous screening process at our Embassy."<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/soareport)</sup></sup>
  
  As for the Spanish-language training manuals: A 1997 investigation found that a few, short passages (out of 1169 pages in total) in the manuals used between 1987 to 1991 didn't meet DoD standards, should be destroyed. It found that there was no deliberate or orchestrated attempt to violate DoD policy, domestic or international law.<sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/soa-ig-phase-1/mode/2up)</sup></sup> The "questionable" passages are nothing that serious either, even while out of context—here are a few:
  > "Specific individuals, organizations and commercial companies must be the object of infiltration by government employees, in order to obtain information about the guerillas."
  
  > "It is essential that internal intelligence agencies obtain information on the political party or parties that support the insurgent movement, on the influence the insurgent has on them, and on the substance of non-violent attacks the insurgents perpetrate against the government."
  
  > "Insurgents "can be considered criminal by the legitimate government" and are "afraid to be brutalized after capture."
  
  > "All the personal documents to include pocket litter should be carefully examined. . . . The documents that have no military value, such as personal items, should be retained to be given to the prisoner at a later time."
  
  > "To detect and neutralize the insurgents' activities and organizations"<sup>[3](https://ia600509.us.archive.org/7/items/USArmySchooloftheAmericasTrainingManuals/US%20Army%20School%20of%20the%20Americas%20Training%20Manuals_text.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup>
  
  Sadly, despite all of this, allegations by conspiracy theorists and sensational headlines—like with ACORN in 2010, proved devastating. Congress closed the school in 2000.

- In Peru, between 1995 and 2001, the CIA worked with the Peruvian Government in a counternarcotics operation. In 2001, the Peruvian Air Force accidentally shot down a US plane carrying missionaries. Shortly after the incident, Director Hayden tasked the CIA's Inspector General reviewed the matter: Finding a lapse in procedures and charged that some CIA officers involved attempted to cover it up. This was disputed by a another seperate, independent [Agency Accountability Board](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/cia-statement-2001-peru-shootdown/story?id=9738624) review, that examined both the IG's report as well as conducting its own investigation. 16 officers were administratively punished after the Board's report was sent to Director Panetta. DOJ concurred with this finding, declining to criminally charge anyone involved. The fault lied mostly with the Peruvian Air Force in failing to adhere to the procedures as they had done so in the past.

- In 1997, on the CIA's 50th anniversary, President Bill Clinton praised the CIA in a number of its successes over the years. Notably, "And here in our own hemisphere, your work with law enforcement has helped us to capture every top drug lord of the Colombian Cali cartel.<sup>[1](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-50th-anniversary-the-central-intelligence-agency-langley-virginia)</sup></sup>

- Haiti, September 1994, US Military forces were ordered to execute [Operation Uphold Democracy](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/combat-studies-institute/csi-books/kretchikw.pdf). The objective was to return to office the democratically elected President, and to facilitate a stable and secure environment in which democratic institutions could take hold. This was successful. President Aristide reassumed his duties, the Junta that ousted him was forced to leave the country, and national elections were successfully held in 1996. The democratic process there was given the opportunity to succeed due, in large part, to Operation Uphold Democracy. 


- In response to the influx of refugees coming out of the 1991 coup in Haiti, the US launched Operation Sea Signal to collect and process these refugees. None were "imprisoned without trial for having HIV" as some conspiracy theorists claim. Initially, the facilities were inadequate to handle so many refugees. However, this quickly turned around. Adequate medical care was provided throughout.<sup>[1](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA527790.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.gao.gov/assets/t-nsiad-92-25.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.marines.mil/portals/1/Publications/A%20Skillful%20Show%20of%20Strength_U.S.%20Marines%20in%20the%20Caribbean,%201991-1996%20%20PCN%2019000410600.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-95-211.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- In 1996, an independent review panel examined all US Government involvement with Guatemala. On CIA's interaction with Guatemalan security services between 1980 and 1996—It also examined the DoD and other US agencies in their relation to counterparts in Guatemala. It concluded:
 "The human rights records of the Guatemalan security services—the D-2 and the Department of Presidential Security (known informally as "Archivos." after one of its predecessor organizations)—were generally known to have been reprehensible by all who were familiar with Guatemala. US policy-makers knew of both CIA's liaison with them and the service's unsavoury reputations. The CIA endeavoured to improve this behavior of the Guatemalan services through frequent and close contact and by stressing the importance of human rights—insisting, for example, that Guatemalan military intelligence training include human rights instruction. The station officers assigned to Guatemala and the CIA headquarters officials whom we interviewed believe that the CIA's contact with the Guatemalan services helped improve attitudes towards human rights.
 
  The CIA's Directorate of Operations (DO) and Guatemala station were clearly aware of the potential for human rights violations by assets and liaison contacts. In November 1988, the DO's Latin America (LA) division provided a guidance cable to its Central American stations:
   >"Point we would like to make is that we must all become sensitized to the importance of respecting human rights, and we must ensure that those assets and resource we direct and/or fund are equally sensitive. The issue will only become more important, and we serve our objectives best if we remember that if we ignore the importance of the human rights issue in the final analysis we do a great damage to our mission. We are under great scrutiny.
   >Finally, aside from the legal and policy considerations which are constant in any allegations concerning violations of human rights we also recognize a basic moral obligation. We are Americans and we must reflect American values in the conduct of our business. We are all inherently opposed to the violation of human rights. Those who work with us in one capacity or another must also respect these values."
   
   The review also finds:
   >"US policy objectives in Guatemala from 1984 to the present--the period we reviewed--included supporting the transition to and strengthening of civilian democratic government, furthering human rights and the rule of law, supporting economic growth, combating illegal narcotics trafficking, combating the communist insurgency, and advancing the current peace process between the government and the guerrillas."
   >"The CIA's successes in Guatemala in conjunction with other US agencies, particularly in uncovering and working to counter coups and in reducing the narcotics flow, were at times dramatic and very much in the national interests of both the United States and Guatemala.<sup>[4](https://web.archive.org/web/20110926214324/http://www.ciponline.org/iob.htm)</sup></sup>
   
   The Independent CIA Inspector General's multi-volume series on Guatemala concludes similar, which was corroborated by the panel's report.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000647948.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000690161.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
  The Department of Defense also issued its 1995 Guatemala [report](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Sep/11/2001806396/-1/-1/1/REPORT%20TO%20THE%20SECRETARY%20OF%20DEFENSE%20ON%20DOD%20ACTIVITIES%20IN%20GUATEMALA%20(U).PDF). It found that US DoD Policy towards Guatemala was:
  >Promoting a stable democratic government to include ending the Marxist insurgency;
  >eliminating human rights abuses;
  >responding to the economic and social needs of the Guatemalan people; and
  >reducing drugs and drug trafficking.

  Based on the documentation reviewed, all significant DoD programs and activities in Guatemala from 1980 to 1995 were within the stated US Policy objectives:
  >There were 1,366 deployments to Guatemala during the period. Involving at least 25,021 DoD personnel. US military personnel performed humanitarian and civic action exercises designed to demonstrate the role of the military in stabilizing a democratic government and improving the economic and social welfare of the Guatemalan people.
  >Since 1990, DoD personnel have supported the Drug Enforcement Administration's effort to interdict narcotics trafficking in Guatemala by transporting law enforcement personnel, detecting suspected trafficking activity, providing intelligence support and assisting in planning counterdrug operations.
  >The DoD security assistance program during the period totalled 28 million in grant aid and 3.384 million in International Military Education and Training. With the exception of one UH-1 helicopter in 1983, no major end items were provided to the Government of Guatemala.
  
- A 1986 GAO report examined US arms supply relationship with Guatemala, it finds that, "direct U.S. military assistance was discontinued between fiscal years 1978 and 1984, and commercial sales dropped significantly in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s because of cited human rights violations. Reagan administration officials and documents stated that their arms transfer policy as it concerns human rights conditions is geared toward rewarding improvement rather than trying to coerce improvement by withholding military assistance, which was the Carter administration’s approach."<sup>[1](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-86-31.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The CIA had no involvement drug trafficking, as alleged by Gary Webb. Several independent investigations could not substantiate the claims and found contradictory information to said allegations, such as when CIA learned of such illegal activities, they tipped off local Law Enforcement to take action. 

  The independent investigations include: Other media outlets, CIA's Inspector General; DOJ's Inspector General; Joint Committee on Contra; the Select Committee on Narc abuse; Crime subcommittee; Foreign Relations Committee; FBI; Special Counsel and lastly the 2000 House Intel Committee, which reviewed all prior investigations, and conducted its own, finding: "Based on its investigation, involving numerous interviews, reviews of extensive documentation, and a thorough and critical reading of other investigative reports, the Committee has concluded that the evidence does not support the implications of the San Jose Mercury News—that the CIA was responsible for the crack epidemic in Los Angeles or anywhere else in the United States to further the cause of the Contra war in Central America."

  From the Joint Committee, "Our investigation has not developed any corroboration of media-exploited allegations that U.S. government-condoned drug trafficking by Contra leaders or Contra organizations or that Contra leaders or organizations did in fact take part in such activity. During the course of our investigation, we examined files of State, DoD, NSC, CIA, DEA, Justice, Customs and FBI, especially those reportedly involving newspaper allegations of Contra drug trafficking... During the course of our investigation, the role of U.S. government officials who supported the Contras' and the private resupply effort, as well as the role of private individuals in resupply, were exhaustively examined. Hundreds of persons, including U.S. government employees, Contra leaders, representatives of foreign governments, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials, military personnel, private pilots and crews involved in actual operations were questioned and their files and records examined. Despite numerous newspaper accounts to the contrary, no evidence was developed indicating that Contra leadership or Contra organizations were actually involved in drug trafficking. Sources of news stories indicating to the contrary were of doubtful veracity. There was no information developed indicating any U.S. government agency or organization condoned drug trafficking by the Contras or anyone else.

  We have discovered that almost all of these allegations originate from persons indicted or convicted of drug smuggling. Justice has stated that such persons are more and more claiming, as a defense, that they were smuggling for the benefit of the Contras in what they believed was a U.S. government sponsored operation. Typically, they furnish no information which can be corroborated by investigation. In addition to the above-mentioned negative file reviews, interviews with employees of these U.S. agencies have also been negative. Contra leaders have been interviewed and their bank records examined. They denied any connection with or knowledge of drug trafficking. Examination of Contra financial records, private enterprise business records and income tax returns of several individuals failed to locate any indication of drug trafficking." An investigator involved in this examination, a retired FBI Special Agent, reiterates this point and says that "the [Certified Public Accountants] who were charged with auditing the Contra bank accounts found no evidence of influxes of cash attributed to drugs" He says the bank accounts examined included the Contra organization's bank accounts in the Bank of Commerce and Credit International, and personal bank accounts. According to the investigator, the sources of all the money in these accounts were accounted for and much came from third country contributors.<sup>[1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112071984519&view=2up&seq=1&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://ia904603.us.archive.org/14/items/reportofcongress87unit/reportofcongress87unit.pdf#page=655)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://archive.org/details/WatersCIAContraReportExcerpt/_Waters_CIAContraReportExcerpt/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/9712/exec.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-10-21-mn-59232-story.html)</sup></sup>

  Despite the conspiracy theories, Garry Webb did indeed commit suicide. No, there was not "two shots to the back of the head". The shots were near his ear, from the side. One bullet missed and went through the cheek due to uncontrolled shaking, the last finished it. Further, yes, it is possible to have two gunshot wounds to the head in suicide. These have been documented long-before Webb's death, and many, many since. Aside from forensic evidence proving it was suicide, His ex-wife at the time also confirmed it would have been suicide, "The way he was acting it would be hard for me to believe it was anything but suicide," she said. According to her, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.<sup>[7](https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/gary-webbs-death-confirmed-as-suicide,109995)</sup></sup> <sup>[8](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004140050065)</sup></sup> <sup>[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12780)</sup></sup> <sup>[10](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-mar-16-et-webb16-story.html)</sup></sup>

  It has been alleged since the 80s, and still persists to this day thanks to movies like 'American Made', that CIA used Mena airport, Arkansas, to do drug smuggling with Barry Seal. This was also refuted by an independent [investigation](https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CIA-Mena-Report.pdf): "Adler Berriman "Barry" Seal was never employed by CIA in any capacity. The only limited contact any CIA personnel had with Seal was during a two-day period in 1984 when Seal was involved in a Drug Enforcement Agency string operation that subsequently implicated a Nicaraguan Government official and members of the Medellin drug cartel in a conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the United States. CIA provided technical support to this operation which involved the installation of two 35mm cameras into a C-123K airplane that Seal used during the operation. CIA personnel discussed with Seal options for installing cameras in the aircraft, and instructed him on the methods of operating the cameras. Other CIA personnel who were present had passing or otherwise brief discussions with Seal. During the course of these discussions, Seal was escorted by DEA personnel. No evidence has been found to indicate that CIA knew Seal's true identity prior to the operation or that its personnel had any other contact with Seal before or after this 1984 operation."
   
- 1979-1987, Nicaragua/Contras. Years of KGB propaganda have tainted the historical record of the US support to the Contras: It was a virtual mirror-image of Nicaraguan support to insurgents in surrounding democratic countries—albeit on a smaller scale and with greater regard for human rights—and that the primary objective of this program was to persuade Nicaragua to abandon its efforts to engineer the overthrow of neighbouring governments by armed force.<sup>[1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/secret-war-in-central-america-and-the-future-of-world-order/0E5915FA4FCD3CAE1328774CF7A540DA)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguavunited0000turn/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://archive.org/details/8066report)</sup></sup> It was not to overthrow the brutal regime, which was committing numerous atrocities and human rights abuses.<sup>[4](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguas-military-build-up-and-support-for-central-american-subversion/mode/2up)</sup></sup>

  Corruption started to seep into the Somoza Government during the mid-70s, which led to wide-spread protests and opposition. With the assassination of Somoza's critic, Pedro, this only intensified the opposition, leading even to non-Marxist resistance groups joining with the FSLN, leading to the creation of a Broad Opposition Front. The Front sought to draw people from all economic classes, ages and professions into the anti-Somoza opposition. At this time, the US, in coordination with the Organization of American States (OAS), pressured Somoza to step down, and peacefully transition Government by democratic election. The US provided several options, however Somoza refused them all. In response, the US cut economic and military aid, and pressured other Governments to do the same—thus resulting in his flee from the country. At this time, the Sandinista forces, a small militant minority moved into Managua and assumed power. The leaders of the FSLN had publicly pledged themselves to the principles of political pluralism, a mixed economy, and a non-aligned foreign policy. Since these pledges were thought to reflect the official position of the new Government of National Reconstruction (GRN), it enjoyed broad international support, and the United States took the lead in the assistance effort, providing $118 million of economic aid and humanitarian assistance during the following 18 months. This was more than any other country provided the new regime, and represented more aid than the United States had provided Somoza in the previous four years. European and Latin American countries, notably Venezuela, also rushed aid to impoverished and war-wracked Nicaragua. The aid, provided by PL 96-257, contained a provision, however, that the US would cease economic aid if it the Sandinistas engaged in suppression of human rights, free press, etc. Despite promising free elections, free enterprise, an independent judiciary, and an end to political oppression, the Sandinistas seized television and radio stations, censored La Prensa, and established a Cuban-modeled internal security apparatus. In 1980, the Sandinista Government announced that it would not hold national elections until 1985. This convinced many Nicaraguans that the prospects for a true democracy were growing dimmer under FSLN dominance. In published statements, Sandinista officials expressed their desire for better relations with the United States and insisted that they had no intention of supporting insurgencies aimed at subverting their neighbors. Their actions, however, began to raise additional doubts. Weapons and equipment sent by Cuba through Nicaragua began making their way to rebels in El Salvador. The Sandinista next led the way in militarizing Central America—leading to instability and a rein of terror across the region, all bankrolled by Russia.<sup>[11](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/public/digitallibrary/smof/publicliaison/beserra/oa19286/40-044-12006223-OA19286-001-2019.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[12](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/central-america-carter)</sup></sup> <sup>[13](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-94/pdf/STATUTE-94-Pg422.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[14](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c070986841&view=1up&seq=626&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[15](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/secret-war-in-central-america-and-the-future-of-world-order/0E5915FA4FCD3CAE1328774CF7A540DA)</sup></sup>
  
  In response to pleas from countries victim to the regime, in 1981, DCI William Casey created the Central America Task Force (CATF) at CIA. A Presidential Finding, signed by President Reagan in December 1981, authorized Agency covert and paramilitary operations, facilitated through friendly governments, against Cuban and Sandinista targets involved in arms trafficking to insurgents in Central America. To ensure CIA's program did not go beyond arms interdiction, Congress enacted an Intelligence Authorization Act in December 1982 that prohibited CIA from supplying money, arms, training, or support to any individual or organization seeking to overthrow the GRN or involved in provoking military confrontations between Nicaragua and Honduras. In September 1983, the Agency was given greater latitude in its relationship with the Contra forces by a new Presidential Finding that changed the objective of Contra support from interdicting arms trafficking to bringing the Sandinistas into peace negotiations. Legislation was enacted in October 1984 that precluded the Agency from providing paramilitary assistance to the Contra forces over the next two years. During this period, the combat effectiveness of the Contra forces declined. NSC staff who were not covered by this legislation,<sup>[16](https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1701&context=plr)</sup></sup> encouraged other states to support the democratic resistance. In October 1986, after considerable debate in Congress, the Agency was authorized to provide paramilitary support to the resistance forces and $100 million was allocated to this purpose for Fiscal Year 1987, beginning in October 1986. The legislation that authorized this assistance contained a provision that barred aid to any group whose members were found to have engaged in "gross violations of internationally recognized human rights... or drug smuggling, or significant misuse of public or private funds.<sup>[17](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112071984519&view=2up&seq=40&skin=2021)</sup></sup> <sup>[18](https://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/documents/d-all-19.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[19](https://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-bruemmer-silverberg.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[20](https://www.hjil.org/articles/hjil-11-1-turner.pdf)</sup></sup>

  As for the legality on this matter, to quote at length from the ICJ dissenting [opinion](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/70/070-19860627-JUD-01-09-EN.pdf) It's worth noting the dissenting opinion is more than twice as long as the judgement, and revisits the factual and legal record before it, applying far more care. Many in-depth studies have pointed out the severe flaws of the ICJ ruling in its treatment of evidence.<sup>[23](https://archive.org/details/nicaraguavunited0000turn/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  "I am profoundly pained to say, I dissent from this judgement because i believe that, in effect, it adopts the false testimony of representatives of the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua on a matter which, in my view, is material to its disposition...
The facts are in fundamental controversy. I find the Court's statement of the facts to be inadequate, in that it is sufficiently sets out the facts which have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to the United States, while insufficiently sets out the facts which should have led it to reach conclusions of law adverse to Nicaragua. 

  Without any pretence, still less actuality, of provocation, Nicaragua since 1979 has assisted and persisted in efforts to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by providing large-scale, significant and sustained assistance to the rebellion in El Salvador - a rebellion which, before the rendering of Nicaraguan assistance, was ill-organised, ill-equipped and ineffective. The delictual acts of the Nicaraguan Government have not been confined to provision of very large quantities of arms, munitions and supplies; Nicaragua (and Cuba) have joined with the Salvadoran rebels in the organisation, planning and training for their acts of insurgency; and Nicaragua has provided the Salvadoran insurgents with command-and-control facilities, bases, communications and sanctuary, which have enabled the leadership of the Salvadoran insurgency to operate from Nicaraguan territory. Under both customary and conventional international law, that scale of Nicaraguan subserve activity not only constitutes unlawful intervention in the affairs of El Salvador; it is cumulatively tantamount to an armed attack upon El Salvador."

  "Not only is El Salvador entitled to defend itself against this armed attack; it can, and has, called upon the United States to assist it in the exercise of collective self-defense. The United States is legally entitled to respond. It can lawfully respond to Nicaragua's covert attempt to overthrow the Government of El Salvador by overt or covert pressures, military and other, upon the Government of Nicaragua, which are exerted either directly upon the Government, territory and people of Nicaragua by the United States, or indirectly through the actions of Nicaraguan rebels - the "contras" - supported by the United States." 
  
  As for the "guerilla manual," it is largely exaggerated by pundits. The CIA learned of a draft manual created by non-Americans in late Spring, 1983. CIA found the manual to be totally unacceptable, because it called for widespread use of indiscriminate violence. US personnel urged the draft manual never be used, and all copies of it destroyed. This, however, prompted CIA to make a code of conduct and training material, to assure FDN fighters going into villages, how to deal with locals, in a manner consistent with FDN's democratic objectives—The code of conduct book, known as the blue book. Every FDN soldier carried one. It explains that the objective of the FDN is the development of a democratic and pluralistic government in Nicaragua, to establish social justice and human rights, to restore the freedoms violated by the Sandinistas, and to achieve economic reform and greater social mobility. At FDN request, a manual was created for Psychological operations, as guidance. Context is critical. It notes that every combatant is highly motivated to engage in propaganda. It explains how they can counter, and win hearts and minds, such as, avoid violence as much as possible.<sup>[24](https://web.archive.org/web/20170215021829/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86B00269R001500230003-7.pdf)</sup></sup> A plain reading of the manual, as Sen. Malcolm Wallop put it, "taken as a whole, the manual calls for the avoidance of violence to the extent possible and was designed to put restraint and a rationale on guerrilla operations as a whole, the manual is a code of conduct for which the United States ought not to be ashamed." After press reporting, [two investigations](https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/statement-principal-deputy-press-secretary-speakes-central-intelligence-agency) followed: One by CIA's Independent Inspector General; one by the President's Intelligence Oversight Board. All concluded the purpose of the manual was to moderate freedom fighters in their struggle against a brutal regime, and how to win support of the people. However, due to poor translation by the contractor who made the document, a few words were misinterpreted, such as "neutralized".<sup>[25](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90B01370R001501940018-3.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- It was alleged that the CIA, in El Salvador, supported right-wing death squads, and encouraged security service abuses—during hostilities between Salvadoran security forces, right-wing groups and left-wing terrorists. This has been a thoroughly debunked USSR hoax, to cover the USSR's support for left-wing death squads and terrorists. Indeed, 3 seperate, independent investigations concluded as much: The House Intel Committee; the Senate Intel Committee and the Inspector General. US pressure, public and private, saw success at moderating security services, the military, police, and overall civic affairs. During the free and fair election of Duarte, a number of reforms took place, most important was judicial. From the House Intel Committee, "The staff's investigation looked at press reports and materials from private organizations alleging a range of US intelligence activities with reference to death squads. These allegations can be summarized as follows: 1) That US intelligence trained, organized, financed and advised Salvadoran security forces that engaged in death squad activities; 2) That US intelligence was aware of torture and killing by Salvadoran security services and death squads, and in some cases participated in such killings.

  The Committee staff conducted a comprehensive review aimed at providing as much information as could be gathered bearing on these allegations. It reviewed intelligence reporting on death squads as well as the intelligence tasking which established priorities for intelligence collection. The Staff examined all intelligence reporting bearing on death squads from 1979 to present. It reviewed State Department cables bearing on the same subject. The staff conducted interviews with numerous intelligence officials knowledgable about intelligence activities in El Salvador from 1979 to 1984. The staff also reviewed in detail a CIA Inspector General report requested by the Committee in connection with H. Res.467. This report reviewed CIA operational relationships that might have involved members of death squads. Finally, the staff made additional requests for information. The staff review of operational intelligence relationships leads it to conclude that US intelligence agencies have not conducted any of their activities in such a way as to directly encourage or support death squad activities. To the contrary, US intelligence activities have been directed, sometimes successfully, at countering death squad activity, reducing the power of individuals connected with death squads, and seeking their removal from positions of authority.
  
  The staff has uncovered no evidence that US intelligence officials or US intelligence policy in any way encouraged torture by Salvadoran security service or by any death squads. To the Contrary, all that the staff can discover indicates US intelligence efforts to moderate the behavior of Salvadoran security service and armed forces personnel to prevent such activities. Further, as the US has learned more about death squad activity, and as it has concentrated more policy attention on this subject, some improvements have taken place. The staff points in this regard to the exile from El Salvador of certain officials identified by the United States as having death Squad connections."

  Further, under continued US commitment, via the Military, Diplomacy, etc. The respect for human rights in El Salvador increased dramatically.<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/death-squad-investigation)</sup></sup>

- On May 1989, General Noriega attempted to nullify Panama's democratic election, where Guillermo Endara had rightfully won. Following this, the US engaged in a prolonged effort to engage diplomatically via the OAS, to persuade Noriega to honor the election results. He did not. On the first of September, the same year, he illegally appointed a new provisional government, headed by his loyalists—after a coup failed, against this coup, he declared that Panama was in a state of war against the US. US soldiers and civilians were killed and wounded after this declaration of war, as well as unlawfully detained. On 20 December, 1989, Operation Just Cause was launched. The United States lawfully invaded the Republic of Panama to overthrow the unelected dictatorship of General Manuel Antonio Noriega. By capturing the general, defeating the military forces he commanded, and returning the country back to the rightful, democratically-elected government. There are many authoritative studies on Operation Just Cause, detailing its success, legality, context, and rebuilding efforts under civic and humanitarian activities.<sup>[1](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-91-174fs.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://history.army.mil/html/books/just_cause/CMH_55-1-1_Just_%20Cause_opt.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Just_Cause.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Apr/05/2001727349/-1/-1/0/B_0061_SHULTZ_AFTERMATH_WAR.PDF)</sup></sup> 

- On October 1983, Grenada found itself in a state of 0 governance, and mass violence, in which Embassies for various countries, including the US, were attacked. In response to a formal request by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), whom these democratic states voted for action, under the 1981 treaty, due to the growing violence in the leaderless state, the US led the joint effort to restore order and peace. The limited stability operations led to very few civilian casualties. "Grenadian casualties were 45 killed and 337 wounded. 24 of the Grenadian dead were civilians, 21 of whom were killed in an unfortunate bombing of a mental hospital located adjacent to an anti-aircraft installation. 24 Cubans were killed and 59 wounded of the approximately 800 Cuban 'construction workers' on the island...

- In 1981, Soviet propaganda outlet TASS, alleged that the United States was behind the death of Panamarian President Omar Torrijos. This was [confirmed](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00049R001303150031-0.pdf) to be be Soviet disinformation.

- During the 1980s, allegations from the Baltimore Sun, reported in 1995, allegations of CIA's complicity in Honduran human rights abuses of the Battalion 3-16 (316), etc. This triggered then-DCI John M. Deutch to direct a review of the allegations, from the 1980s to 1995, the review, known as the Honduras Working Group concluded, "there is no information in CIA files indicating that CIA officers either authorized or were directly involved in human rights abuses." Some issues remained unresolved, and reported this to CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin. In July 1996, she requested the Inspector General investigate these outstanding matters. The IG report corroborated the Working Group's findings, "No evidence has been found to substantiate the allegation that any CIA employee was present during sessions of hostile interrogation or torture in Honduras." It also found no connection to the CIA in connection to, or evidence of the existence to ELACH, an alleged right-wing paramilitary organization; nor involved in any attempts to cover-up or downplay reporting. These two reviews independently corroborated a 1988 IG investigation that found no CIA aid or connection to any human rights abuses. An OGC review also confirmed CIA had no involvement in, planned, or otherwise connected to Olancho Operation. CIA policy regarding interrogations, and human rights in general is best described in a January 14, 1985 HQ cable:
  >"...Intervewing and interrogation of suspect in custody is a method routinely used by police, security and intelligence services around the world. In many countries, legal and basic rights of the suspect in custody may not be given full consideration, resulting in deprivation of his/her human rights. CIA policy is not to participate directly in nor to encourage interrogation that results in the use of force, mental or physical torture, extremely demeaning indignities or exposure to inhumane treatment of any kind, as an aid to interrogation. CIA policy is to actively discourage the use of these methods during interrogations. CIA should play a positive role in influencing foreign liasion to respect human rights." Participation includes being in the room during an interrogation, sitting in an adjoining room monitoring the interrogation or providing questions while an interrogation is in progress. 

  A March 1976 HQ cable described CIA's Human Rights Policies and guidance,
  >"...employees must be especially sensitive to the political and possible legal ramifications of what the CIA does. This cable also included a description of CIA officer's responsibilities if it were to be discovered that a host or third country intelligence or security service was about to undertake actions that could reasonably be construed to be gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. CIA personnel  also were advised in this cable that, as a general rule, they should make appropriate efforts to prevent or delay such actions..."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000159944.pdf)</sup></sup>

- The US had no involvement in the Argentina military coup in 1976. The US noted in the years prior, "consistently characterized the situation in Argentina as “deteriorating.” Throughout 1975 and into early 1976, U.S. officials in Argentina repeatedly warned Washington that a coup was likely due to crime, violence, and instability under the government of Isabel Peron. US intelligence focused more on collection on leftist terrorists such as Montoneros and ERP, who finances their operations through kidnapping and extortion, sometimes targeted U.S. citizens. The Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations all pressured the new government to abide by human rights, and release those illegally imprisoned. Carter's being the most public and vocal, while Reagan pressured behind closed doors. during 1977 and 1978 the Carter Administration’s policy toward Argentina was shaped by the Kennedy-Humphrey Amendment (P.L. 95-92, sec. 11), a Congressionally-mandated halt on all U.S. military aid, training, and arms sales to Argentina, which was enacted in August 1977 and went into effect on October 1, 1978. Carter’s human rights pressure also pushed the junta to look for allies elsewhere who were less focused on human rights, including in the Eastern bloc and the Soviet Union.<sup>[1](https://www.intel.gov/argentina/history)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/STEPS%20TO%20IMPROVE%20U.S.-ARG%5B15503036%5D.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1963-1973, CIA's activities in Chile are subject to a severe misunderstanding in popculture. It has been alleged that: 1. CIA was involved in the coup. 2. CIA aided in Pinochet's rise to power. 3. CIA directly engaged in, or ignored human rights abuses in Chile. None of these allegations are true.
  1. CIA undertook a covert propaganda campaign against Allende and other Marxists through media outlets, leaflets, etc. After the September 1970 election, CIA sought to influence a Congressional run-off vote required by the Constitution because Allende did not win an absolute majority. The CIA was to continue its propaganda campaign to keep the opposition alive until the 1976 elections. After the 1970 election, CIA kept contacts on Chilean military officers in order to continue to facilitate intelligence collection activities, however, there was no effort to assist them. As coup rumours and planning escalated by the end of 1972, __CIA exercised extreme care in all dealings with Chilean military officers__ and continued to monitor their activities but __under no circumstances attempted to influence them.__ By October 1972 the __consensus within the US government__ was that the military intended to launch a coup at some point, that it did not need US support for a successful coup, and that __US intervention or assistance in a coup should be avoided.__ On August 1973, the 40 Committee approved $1 million to politically aid opposition political parties. When CIA's station in Chile became convinced that opposition had shifted towards a coup, __CIA Headquarters reaffirmed__ to the Station that there __was to be no involvement__ with the military in any covert action initiative; __there was no support for instigating a military coup.__
  2. Pinochet was not a coup plotter. CIA also did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency. 
  3. The IC followed then-current guidance for reporting such abuses and admonished its Chilean agents against such behavior. CIA officers and assets were tasked to report on human rights violations by the Chilean government. During a period between 1974 and 1977, CIA maintained contact with Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who later became notorious for his involvement in human rights abuses. The US Government policy community approved CIA's contacts with Contreras, given his position as chief of the primary intelligence organization in Chile, as necessary to accomplish the CIA's mission, in spite of concerns that this relationship might lay the CIA open to charges of aiding internal political repression. From the start, the CIA made it clear to Contreras was that it would not support any of his activities or activities of his service which might be construde as "internal political repression." In its contacts with Contreras, the CIA urged him to adhere to a 17 January 1974 circular, issued by the Chilean Ministry of Defense, spelling out guidelines for handling prisoners in a manner consistent with the 1949 Geneva Convention. In May and June 1975, elements within the CIA recommended establishing a paid relationship with Contreras to obtain intelligence based on his unique position and access to Pinochet. This __proposal__ was __overruled__, citing the US Government policy on clandestine relations with the head of an intelligence service notorious for human rights abuses. However, given miscommunications in the timing of this exchange, a one-time payment was given to Contreras. A review of CIA’s files has uncovered no evidence that CIA officers and employees were engaged in human rights abuses or in covering up any human rights abuses in Chile.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20040409084054/http://www.foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp)</sup></sup> 

  It also cannot be overstated the dictatorship that Allende favoured over strong, traditional democratic institutions and processes. Communist Party leaders were largely in charge of the economic program of the Allende government. The communists intended gradually to replace private enterprise by State enterprise, thus enabling the government to assume complete social and economic power. The government, therefore, drew up a list of all Chilean corporations whose capital reserves exceeded $500,000. These companies, representing 82% of the capital holdings of all companies incorporated in Chile, were earmarked for nationalization. Congress atempted to block this government program by passing legislation defining the economic areas subject to government ownership, but the government continued to take over Chilean firms, using methods which became progressively more illegal.
  
  These methods ranged from expropriations (declared unconstitutional by the Chilean Supreme Court) , to requisitions (many of which were declared illegal by the Chilean Office of the Comptroller General) "decrees of insistence" (a rarely used judicial tool created to resolve differences of legal interpretations between the judiciary and the executive). In agriculture, all farms exceeding 80 hectares of irrigated land were made subject to legal expropriation. These "legal" expropriations were supplemented by those of roving armed bands who took possession of agricultural properties by force without any intervention by the Chilean police. Similarly, a series of economic pressures was exerted to silence the independent media, including coercion, bribery, the manipulation of government control over credit, imports and prices, and the incitement of strikes.
  
  As an adjunct to economic pressures, the Allende government began to develop the concept of "popular power", creating parallel revolutionary organizations which duplicated the functions of existing legal organizations. For example, special communal commands, known as JAPS, were established to control the distribution of essential articles, mainly food. Government supplies were channeled through these new organizations rather than through established retailed outlets. Of Soviet origin, the communal commands had the dual function of displacing "bourgeois" organizations and of training their members for armed revolution. 
  
  Prior to the Allende regime, Chile had a strong democratic tradition and a firm commitment to constitutional processes. Under the Allende regime, its institutions fought long and tenaciously to save themselves from destruction by legal, constitutional means. When the government violated Chilean law, protests were filed with the courts and "contraloria." When the courts and the Contraloria objected to these violations, however, the government either paid no heed to these decisions or over-ruled them through "decrees of insistence", which were themselves illegal. The National Congress also tried to check these violations of the law by impeaching the ministers responsible for them, but Allende merely moved the ousted ministers from one post to another, thus thwarting the purpose of Congressional sanctions. Finally, when all the protests of the Congress, the courts and the Contraloria had been repeatedly ignored, these bodies solemnly declared that the Allende government had placed itself outside both the law and the Constitution. These declarations were made by the Supreme Court on May 26, 1973, by the Contraloria on July 2, 1973, and by the Chamber of Deputies on August 22, 1973.

  The Chamber's declaration was, in fact, a notice to the armed forces that the legal and constitutional order of the country had broken down.<sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/finalreportofsel01unit/page/578/mode/2up)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=txu.059173026788036&view=2up&seq=6&q1=Report+of+the+Bar+Association)</sup></sup>

- The US Government did not create, condone, participate or ignore the activities several Latin American countries engaged in under Operation Condor. The US engaged in attempts to prevent & disrupt the illegal activities and distance its personnel from the services that engaged in the acts. The US asked Contreras to confirm its existence. He did. Only Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay were involved.<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/condor-memo)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/MEMO%20ABOUT%20OPERATION%20COND%5B15502884%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20040409084054/http://www.foia.state.gov/Reports/HincheyReport.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/POTENTIAL%20POLITICAL%20AND%20S%5B15499948%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- In 1969-1970, it was stated by Soviet [propaganda](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/inss/Strategic-Perspectives-11.pdf), that Dan Mitrione (who was a U.S. Agency for International Development officer), was a CIA operative, and ran a torture campaign in Uruguay. Mitrione was kidnapped by the Tupamaros terrorists—who cited the Russian disinformation book as to how they learned he was a US Government employee, simply because his name appeared there, and that he had a role, as an alleged CIA operative, trained riot Police, they knew nothing about the unfounded accusations of torture. 

- In the 1970s, the United States took a large effort to promote Human Rights via humanitarian aid, military assistance, intelligence cooperation, international institutions, etc. Carter's administration set up NSC 28 to coordinate US Human Rights [policy](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP91M00696R000100030020-1.pdf), assess [impacts](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01362A000200100001-6.pdf) and to detail [efforts](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/RESPONSE%20TO%20PD-30%5B15516322%5D.pdf) to promote Human Rights. In 1977, Human Rights reporting became a main focus on US Intelligence reporting requirements, with positive customer feedback in formulating US foreign policy.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP83M00171R001200180001-5.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
- CIA had [no involvement](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf) in the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo's assassination. Some Latin American countries thought the US had allowed his brutal regime, however, it was just US policy to refrain from actions that would hasten his downfall. The US did encourage moderate democratic groups to resist the regime, by running for office during elections, to maintain political viability—such as student groups, labor unions, civic groups, etc.<sup>[1](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-100-doc2.pdf)</sup></sup>  

- Between the 1960s and 1974, the US Agency for International Development (AID) begun a world-wide program to help train police in various countries to develop better professionally, including respect for human rights. While results varied, it should be noted, contrary to conspiracy theorists and political pundits, that the CIA was not involved with AID's Office of Public Safety, by which this activity was run.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP73B00296R000100020105-3.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-92-118.pdf)</sup></sup> Some may try to suggest the Special Group CI is evidence of CIA's involvement—however, such programs were just "scrutinized" by SGCI.<sup>[3](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v08/d102)</sup></sup> 

- In Bolivia, 1971, CIA made a one-time payment to [discourage](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve10/d76a) a reportedly imminent coup and to “cement relations” with Bolivian military figures. Unknown to the CIA, a coup would follow two days later.

- The basic covert action goals in Bolivia are to foster democratic solutions to critical and social, economic, and political problems; to check Communist and Cuban subversion; to encourage a stable government favorably inclined toward the United States; and to encourage Bolivian participation in the Alliance for Progress. US President Johnson took office in 1963, he inherited a longstanding U.S. Government policy of providing financial support for Bolivian political leaders. The policy was intended to promote stability in Bolivia by strengthening moderate forces, especially within the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) itself, which had a strong left wing under the leadership of Juan Lechin Oquendo, General Secretary of the Mine Workers’ Federation. In August 1963 the 5412 Special Group approved a covert subsidy to assist the MNR to prepare for the presidential elections scheduled for May 1964. The Special Group agreed in March 1964 that the MNR receive additional financial support. Paz won the election; Lechin (who had been Vice President under Paz) left the government and founded a rival leftist party. Covert action expenditures in Bolivia between fiscal year 1963 and fiscal year 1965 were as follows: FY 63—$337,063; FY 64—$545,342; and FY 65—$287,978. The figure for FY 65 included funds to influence the campesino movement, for propaganda, to support labor organizations, and to support youth and student groups. The FY 66 program also allocated funds to support moderate political groups and individuals backing General Barrientos for President.

  On November 4, 1964, the new Vice President, General René Barrientos Ortuño (MNR), led a successful military coup d’etat, forcing Paz into exile, (No US involvement in coup). In February 1965 the 303 Committee authorized a financial subsidy to the MNR under Barrientos (who was aware of U.S. financial support to the MNR) to help establish an organizational base for the presidential election scheduled for September. In May 1965 Barrientos responded to growing labor unrest by arresting and deporting Lechin and postponing the election. The 303 Committee, which considered a recommendation to support Barrientos as the best available candidate, agreed in July 1965 and March 1966 to authorize additional funds for MNR propaganda and political action in support of the ruling Junta’s plans to pacify the country and hold elections to establish a civilian, constitutional government.

  When the presidential election was finally held in July 1966, Barrientos won easily, and officials concerned with the covert operation concluded that the objectives of the program—the _end of military rule_ and a _civilian, constitutional government_ whose _policies would be compatible with those of the United States—had been accomplished._<sup>[1](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d147)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://sgp.fas.org/advisory/state/bolivia.html)</sup></sup>

- By March 1964, it appeared to many in Brazil, and around the world that Goulart was "definitely engaged on campaign to seize dictatorial power". As the "immediate tactics of the Goulart palace guard are concentrated on pressures to secure from the Congress constitutional reforms unattainable by normal means, using a combination of sporadic rural violence, and abuse of the enormous discretionary financial power of the federal government." Combined with subjecting radio and TV outlets to a partial censorship, increasing the use of the National News Agency and requisitioning broadcast time for its reformist propaganda, and making thinly veiled threats against the opposition press. The purpose is not in fact to secure constructive social and economic reforms, but to discredit the existing constitution and the Congress, laying a foundation for a coup from the top down which might then be ratified by a rigged plebiscite and the rewriting of the constitution by a rigged Constituent Assembly." To counter this, the declassified record has only shown that the US, "covert support for pro-democracy street rallies, discreet passage of word that USG deeply concerned at events, and encouragement democratic and anti-Communist sentiment in Congress, armed forces, friendly labor and student groups, church, and business." No evidence has been found that the US was involved directly or indirectly in the coup.<sup>[1](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d187)</sup></sup>
  
  
- In 1964 the US covertly supported an independent British Guiana (Guyana), by funding various left/moderate minority-group political parties for upcoming democratic elections, to reach the goal of a moderate Government that would pursue a multi-racial policy, and engage in realistic social and economic development programs. Initially the US worked with Cheddi Jagan, but he became more racist and aligned with the Soviet Union, since the PPP militia requested and started to receive KGB covert aid.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20141018135832/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000112273.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/Guianaoverview)</sup></sup>

 - 1960-1962, CIA's activities against Castro. A number of allegations stem from a poor reading of selective documents, out of thousands: that assassination and sabotage was a main and integral part of anti-Castro activities, including the use of the mafia. An authoritative history on the subject finds this is not so:
   > "By way of summarizing, it would appear that CIA's official anti-Castro program as reflected in Project JMATE did not include assassination as an integral part of its operational planning... In terms of Project JMATE itself, the few bits
of information which indicate the possibility of assassination attempts against the Cuban leadership also fail to demonstrate any responsibility for their initiation on the part of WH/4. If anything, the evidence would indicate that WH/4's position was one of watchful waiting and wishful thinking that dissident Cubans would themselves eliminate the Castros and Che Guevara. The possibility, of course, that Agency-supplied weapons might be involved in such an attempt cannot be ruled out. Obviously it would be foolish to contend that those principally responsible for developing CIA's anti-Castro program would have objected to the assassination of Fidel Castro. On the other hand, this was not one of the basic concepts nor intentions of the official program of the Central Intelligence Agency."

   > "Similarly, because of the sensationalism which surrounded the Senate Select Committee's report on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders, including Fidel Castro and the implications that the Mafia plot was a part of the authorized planning for the Bay of Pigs Operation, a thorough examination of the evidence was undertaken to determine if this allegation was supportable. It was not. The Mafia operation was run aside from, apart from, and independent of the formal anti-Castro program which was undertaken by CIA... allegations that the assassination plans being developed by the Mafia were a fundamental part of the official US Government program to overthrow Fidel Castro: There is no basis in fact for this charge."

   > "...aside from considerable emphasis on the propaganda activity, there was only limited support for sabotage activities prior to the end of Eisenhower's administration. There was considerable concern over the necessary formalities of diplomacy in order that the United States not be involved in investigations by either the UN or the OAS for its anti-Castro program."<sup>[1](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/104-10301-10004.pdf)</sup></sup> 
   
   Further, "The cumulative impact of the foregoing and the attachments are the strong suggestions that organized crime elements had an ongoing operation to assassinate Castro before this Agency instituted Phase I and that Frank Sturgis was involved with these organized crime elements." The same was concluded for Sam Giancana.<sup>[2](https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/cia/18395.pdf)</sup></sup>   
   
   Lastly, Operation Mongoose had strict limitations on sabotage: "No sabotage would be undertaken against food supplies, medical facilities, or directly against the population of Cuba as such."<sup>[3](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/6434690/National-Security-Archive-Doc-14-CIA-William.pdf#page=2)</sup></sup>
   
- Between 1958 and 1966, US helped Colombia deal with anti-narcotics efforts and counter-terrorism operations via train and advise efforts. US Survey teams recommended "Employing the [Colombian] armed forces in tasks intended to contribute to the economic development and social well-being of all Colombians, especially those subjected to guerrilla-bandit activity." Following this recommendation, the Lleras administration established rehabilitation commissions and thirty welfare teams to coordinate efforts to improve living conditions of those affected by violent activity. The rehabilitation commissions, which operated at a national level, tracked programs in designated zones, coordinated relief efforts, and improved access to credit for peasants displaced by the violence.  The welfare teams, which operated at a local level, consisted of a doctor, a nurse, agrarian technicians, an engineer, a veterinarian, a home economist, and sometimes a public administrator. The teams acted as on-the-ground advisors for small, local projects, such as “[building] rural schools, mills, medical facilities, or ‘model’ farms.”10 In conjunction with the US country team, the military also developed plans to mend violence-ridden regions through social projects. First on an ad hoc basis, but then under the auspices of a presidential decree, the Colombian government developed road infrastructure, health care facilities, literacy programs, and access to potable water, among other activities, in the affected areas. Many Colombians were trained at the US Army School of the Americas (SOA), on civic action programs. By 1969, the Colombian government had built 138 road systems; provided medical treatment to 1.1 million civilians and dental care to nearly 900,000; and built forty-four wells, twenty-three health centers, and ninety-nine schools. Crime statistics during this period did decline, as did participation in criminal bands. A study of the impact of the civic action projects (code name Simpatico) conducted in the late 1960s by the Colombian and US governments did report a positive impact after exhaustive research in the affected areas.<sup>[1](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=monographs)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://arsof-history.org/articles/pdf/v2n4_plan_lazo.pdf)</sup></sup> Conspiracy theorists have long-alleged that the US provided support to Los Pepes. However, an independent panel found that some intelligence provided to the Medellín Task Force may have incidentally ended up in their hands. by locals. CIA reported that the Colombian defense minister, Rafael Pardo, was "concerned that the police are providing intelligence to Los Pepes." A document titled, "Colombia: Extralegal Steps Against Escobar Possible," Agency analysts predicted that President Gaviria's "demand for an intensified effort to capture Escobar may lead some subordinates to rely more heavily on Los Pepes and on extralegal means."<sup>[3](https://ia601502.us.archive.org/0/items/lospepes-blue-ribbon-1/lospepes%20blue%20ribbon1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://ia601409.us.archive.org/20/items/lospepes-blueribbon-2/lospepes%20blueribbon2.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://www.soc.mil/ARIS/books/pdf/ARIS_Colombia-BOOK.pdf)</sup></sup> 
    
- In 1958, the United States approached Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, to step down from power, both formally and with his long-standing friend in business, and for him to leave the Cuba scene for good, not support any elected person who'd merely be his puppet—in a bid to politically cease the hostilities between the "revolutionaries" who used terrorist tactics, against the Government and civilian populations. The US ceased its military aid to Batista, only supplying a limited number of radios. Prior to even 1958, the United States pressured, to some success, for the regime's military forces to respect human rights from a top-down level.<sup>[1](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v06/d189)</sup></sup>

- In 1954, the CIA had an involvement in the coup in Guatemala. However, a number of myths persist as to why the US did what they did: That it was driven because of United Fruit lobbying (capitalism interests); was against the peasants, farmers, overall, the working class and engaged in assassinations. This narrative simply just doesn't fall in line with facts of reality:
  > "The US was concerned of Soviet penetration, as a breach head to launch attacks and other operations by the KGB against the US, as it became increasingly overt and covert in its influence operations in Guatemala."

  > "United Fruit's vast holdings and monopolies on communications and transit in Central America attracted the attention of lawyers in the Justice Department's antitrust division as early as 1919. In May 1951, they were preparing for court action to force United Fruit to divest itself of railroads and utilities in Guatemala when State Department intervened. In a National Security Council session, Department representatives argue that a legal attack on United Fruit's Guatemalan holdings would have 'serious foreign policy implications,' weakening the company at a time when the United States needed it. The action was suspended until the situation in Guatemala had improved. It is often asserted that the United States acted at the company's behest in Guatemala, but this incident suggests the opposite was true: the administration wanted to use United Fruit to contain Communism in the hemisphere." After the success of PBSUCCESS and United Fruit's use had ended, "the State Department demanded the company grant higher wages , not just in Guatemala, but throughout the hemisphere. The Eisenhower administration proceeded with its suspended antitrust action, and in 1958 the company signed a consent decree divesting it of its holdings in railroads and marketing operations."
  
  > "CIA supported the objectives of the Guatemalan land reform—the breakup of large estates into small freeholds—in some of its own programs. the Agency supported farm cooperative movement. In 1951, the Directorate of Plans undertook a global program to encourage small, independent landowners. In Guatemala, the program organised 15,000 peasants into 75 study groups, each of which formed a credit union to help its members buy land."<sup>[1](https://ia601303.us.archive.org/6/items/CIA-Guatemala-Coup-Report/DOC_0000134974.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20180609064148/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000135796.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Since 2007, US Africa Command (AFRICOM), has done a number of assistance programs to African countries, ranging from [humanitarian aid, civil assistance](https://www.africom.mil/what-we-do), etc.
  Some of these are:
   - >Foreign Disaster Relief: Foreign Disaster Relief activities are unique Department of Defense capabilities (normally airlift or logistics) supporting USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) specific requests as approve by the U.S. Secretary of Defense. AFRICOM has responded to two disasters in the last decade (Ebola in West Africa in 2014, and Tropical Storm Idia in Mozambique in 2018), while BHA responds to dozens annually. The international community and BHA are normally able to respond to most disasters without DoD support. It is only the sudden onset catastrophic disasters overwhelming international community that require DoD support.
   - >Humanitarian and Civic Assistance: Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) activities are conducted in conjunction with authorized operations and exercises of the military services in a foreign country, with the approval of the partner nation national and local civilian authorities, and complement - not duplicate - other forms of humanitarian assistance provided to the partner nation by the Department of State and USAID. Funded by AFRICOM, these activities also serve the basic economic and social needs of the partner nation and promote the security and foreign policy interests of the U.S., the security interests of the country in which the activities are to be performed, and the specific operational readiness skills of the service members who participate in the HCA activities.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Disaster Preparedness Program: The Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP) increases the capacity of African nations to mitigate and prepare for an all-hazard disaster response within the ministry designated to respond. The program supports civilian-military interface, and enhancing collaboration and the military’s ability to perform their civil support functions. It also improves the capacity for regional interaction and stability in the event of a complex emergency such as a pandemic event. Working with national and regional entities in a comprehensive, holistic manner, the program builds capacity and capability over time. Funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), the DPP may provide training, planning support, technical assistance, exercise validation, and equipment purchases.
   - >Humanitarian Mine Action: The Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) program relieves human suffering and the adverse effects of land mines and other explosive remnants of war on noncombatants - including ammunition stockpiles - while advancing theater campaign plan strategies and U.S. national security objectives. The Department of Defense supports foreign governments in detection, clearance, physical security, and stockpile management of landmines and other explosive remnants of war by executing cadre development programs designed to develop capabilities for a wide range of HMA activities including education, training, and technical assistance.
   - >Humanitarian Assistance – Other: U.S. Africa Command’s Humanitarian Assistance - Other (HA-O) program includes activities designed to relieve or reduce endemic conditions such as human suffering, disease, hunger, and privation, particularly in regions where humanitarian needs may pose major challenges to stability, prosperity, and respect for universal human values. These program activities are funded by the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid appropriation (OHDACA), and address basic healthcare, education, and infrastructure needs. Common projects include construction of health clinics, schools, and provision of humanitarian supplies, and are intended to reduce the risk of, prepare for, mitigate the consequences of, or respond to humanitarian disasters.
   - >Pandemic Response Program: Since 2008 U.S. Africa Command has worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development to establish a Pandemic Response Program (PRP) aimed at assisting African militaries develop influenza pandemic response plans that are integrated into their country’s overall national response plans. Militaries can play key roles in the event of a pandemic, working in collaboration with other governmental, non-governmental and international organizations to maintain security, provide logistical support for food, medicine and other commodities, maintain communications, and provide augmented medical care. PRP strives to improve the capacity for regional stability in the event of a complex emergency by providing training and technical assistance, and identifies - and at times purchases - limited equipment needed for selected countries.
   - >Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP): The Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program is the DoD initiative in support of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that aims to support healthy and functional military forces to provide stability and safety to national and regional populations. Africa’s high rates of HIV/AIDS negatively impact African militaries and other uniformed organizations by reducing readiness, limiting peacekeeping deployments, and increasing risk to military and civilian personnel. DHAPP provides military-to-military program support by assisting in the development and implementation of culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment programs. AFRICOM provides oversight and strategic guidance so that DHAPP can develop and implement a culturally focused, military-specific HIV prevention, care and treatment program. At over $100 million annually and operating in 38 countries, DHAPP is AFRICOM’s largest program on the Continent.
Current strategies and interventions employed by DHAPP include: Index case HIV testing (testing spouses, sexual partners, and all children of women who test HIV-positive); Documentation of every new HIV-positive individual and linking him or her into care and treatment; Periodically updating military HIV policies to address HIV testing strategies, chain of command notifications, deployments, stigma and discrimination, and antiretroviral treatment initiation and retention to reflect changes in international normative guidance; Antiretroviral treatment services thru mobile units; Condom and lubricant (where feasible) promotion, skills building, and facilitated access to condoms; Promotion of voluntary medical male circumcision services which can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection in HIV-negative men by 60%; and stigma and discrimination prevention training.

- The US Department of Defense offers legal education to any nation who requests, through the [Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEpHRVqEgs4). A highly effective program that tailors to the specific host country. Members of the a foreign Military may visit the US, in Resident programs, or, the US may conduct workshops within the Country. These cover a [wide-variety](https://globalnetplatform.org/system/files/diils_2020_catalog_no_contacts.pdf) of legal issues: Human rights law, military justice, equal rights, etc. It has seen [major success](https://youtu.be/zEpHRVqEgs4?t=497), over a decade, DILLS worked with a number of African nations on justice reform, and methods to investigate and prosecute military personnel for sexual violent and gender-based crimes within the military. This sustained effort saw a sharp decline in sexual assault cases, an increase in successful investigations and prosecutions. These offer the ability to increase civilian oversight of the military, to either enhance, or develop their legal framework.

- Some fringe conspiracy theorists claim that Susan Rice, an American diplomat, was behind Moshood Abiola (MKO)'s death in 1998. However, an independent team of physicians and pathologists from the Nigerian government, Nigerian Medical Association, Canada, UK and the US conducted an autopsy and found substantial evidence of longstanding heart disease and that, in the opinion of the team, rapid deterioration of the diseased heart was the mechanism of death by natural causes.<sup>[1](https://1997-2001.state.gov/briefings/statements/1998/ps980711.html)</sup></sup>

- Between 1992 and 1994, the United States Military worked with the United Nations in [humanitarian](https://history.army.mil/html/documents/somalia/SomaliaAAR.pdf) operations in Somalia, to combat famine during the civil war. This proved to initially be [successful](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/History/Monographs/Somalia.pdf) in its core mission, "The efforts of UNITAF could be rated a success in the sense that, when UNOSOM took over on 4 May 1993, Mogadishu was calm, heavy weapons had been stored in cantonments, and marauding gangs were suppressed. Food supplies were flowing, starvation practically had ceased, drought eased, and seeds and livestock were being replenished." 

- In 2012, the Boston Globe made headlines claiming that the Defence Intelligence Agency confirmed that Charles Taylor, between the early 1980s and 2003, was aided by the CIA in his many war crimes. However, the Boston Globe issued a retraction to this sensational headline. They didn't know how FOIA worked. The DIA merely acknowledged it had records concerning him, not of any substance. As the paper points out, "Taylor, now standing trial before a UN special court on charges of rape, murder and other offenses, denies he was ever a source for US intelligence. The Globe had no adequate basis for asserting otherwise and the story should not have run in this form."<sup>[1](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2012/01/25/for-record/I6Lia8WmEGjBxd186zZccJ/story.html)</sup></sup>

- 1986 - Operation El Dorado Canyon launched lawful airstrikes against Libya, in response to a series of terrorist attacks ordered and supported by Libyan warlord and dictator, Gaddafi. Studies have found this highly successful raid resulted in a decline in Libyan-backed international terrorism. Admiral Kelso imposed strict rules of engagement to avoid or reduce the possibility of civilian casualties in the congested urban area of Tripoli, while inflicting as much damage as possible on the targets . He insisted that each airplane should have positive identification of its assigned target on multiple systems and abort its attack if weapon-guidance or navigation systems were not fully functional.<sup>[1](https://media.defense.gov/2012/Aug/23/2001330097/-1/-1/0/Op%20El%20Dorado%20Canyon.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576109708436039?journalCode=uter20)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1722&context=jil)</sup></sup>

- Angolan civil war, 1975. The officer's revolt in Lisbon in April 1974 provided the catalyst for the political upheavals in Angola that ultimately resulted in civil war and foreign intervention. In the immediate aftermath of the Portuguese coup, Moscow took a wait-and-see attitude toward Angola while carefully monitoring events there. The first concrete Soviet involvement following the coup was the shipment of small arms to Neto's faction in the latter part of 1974. This aid was in part designed to counteract Peking's increasing material support for the MPLA's chief rival for power, the FNLA. The Angolan civil war may be said to have begun in March 1975. That month saw the first major outbreak of hostilities between competing Angolan factions since the signing of the Alvor Accord. It was also in March that the Soviet Union first became involved in the Angolan conflict in a major way by sending substantial amounts of military aid to the faction it favored. Surrounding African nations asked the US to help prevent Moscow imposing a government of its own choice on Africans. Only on July 17, US decided to make its first major investment in Angola. The first American plane carrying arms for the FNLA arrived in Zaire on July 29, and a single shipload of military supplies departed August 28, more than five months after the Soviets began sending substantial quantities of arms by sea and air. Moscow would undoubtedly have preferred to avoid such large-scale, overt involvement before November 11, the date the Portuguese had set for Angolan independence. The Soviets had undoubtedly hoped that by November 11 the MPLA would be able to declare itself the government of Angola, and request Soviet aid on an official state-to-state basis. But the November escalation shows the lengths to which the Soviets were willing to go and the risks they were willing to run to achieve their basic objective—imposition of the MPLA as the sole ruling group in Angola. As at several other stages in the crisis, Moscow was not confronted by a simple choice between military victory or defeat for its clients. A third option, which was preferred by the US, China and many African states, was still available—a coalition government representing all three liberation movements.

  US assistance to the anti-MPLA forces was limited in scope and purpose, and did not provide a major provocation for the Soviet-Cuban escalation. In all, the US during 1975 supplied 2,800 tons of military equipment valued at $31.7 million to the anti-MPLA forces, compared to the 20,000 tons valued at approximately $200 million supplied to the MPLA by Moscow and Havana. The purpose of US objectives were to create a stalemate on the battlefield, to provide leverage for diplomatic efforts to end all foreign intervention, and to seek a peaceful solution within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Beginning in October, US officials communicated these objectives to Moscow so that US intentions and actions would not be misread. In sum, the magnitude and character of the Soviet-Cuban intervention argue against the thesis that it was primarily a response to the involvement of other outside powers. The flow of weapons, advisors, and troops was disproportionate to the direct military support provided to anti-MPLA forces by Zaire and South Africa and to the indirect military assistance rendered by China and the US. Moscow and Havana brought overwhelming force to bear on their primary objective—the defeat of the FNLA-UNITA coalition and the creation of a government in Angola beholden to the Soviet Union.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000518406.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Overtime, Angolans started to view the Cubans and Soviets as "the new colonialists." Angolans frequently criticize the Cubans for being arrogant, for ignoring African sensibilities, and for monopolizing with the Soviets the few remaining luxuries in the country, where Cubans enjoy conspicuously high standards of living while Angolans experience severe shortages of food and other basic necessities. Furthermore, the Cubans and the Soviets are also being faulted for lack of economic progress and the failure to eliminate insurgency. The presence of Cuban troops in Angola, supporting the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and Angolan President Agostinho Neto, complicated efforts by the MPLA and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to end the civil war in the country. Their presence also created concerns that Cuban troops would be introduced into the conflicts in Namibia and Rhodesia. In early 1977, Carter instructed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to explore ways to improve relations with Angola and end the civil war. The issue of Cuban troops and the need to decrease their presence dominated the discussions. The administration decided upon a two-pronged approach: direct talks with the Angolans to convince them to tell the Cubans to leave and a covert propaganda operation highlighting the negative impact of Cuban presence on both Cuban and Angolan societies.<sup>[2](https://static.history.state.gov/frus/frus1977-80v16/pdf/frus1977-80v16.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1966, the NLC, a body of a few military and police officers, overthrew President of Ghana, Nkrumah's corrupt and authoritarian regime. It established a number of committees by civilian specialists to provide guidance and expertise on political affairs and governance, and pledged (and kept its promise) to stay in power only for 2-3 years<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00826A003200100001-9.pdf#page=4)</sup></sup> after rooting out the corruption and deep Soviet, Chinese and East German intelligence service penetration.<sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017165629/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol11no3/pdf/v11i3a01p.pdf)</sup></sup> The US had no involvement in this coup, but did learn of plotting beforehand. 

- Between 1960 and 1968, the US Government engaged in overt and covert political aid, in building a stable, moderate Government in the Congo, through various Congolese administrations. Important context:  At this point, the Congo had a population of 14 million divided into over 200 ethnic groups and four major tribes, with fewer than 20 Congolese college graduates in the entire country, led by a government heavily dependent on the former Belgian colonialists to maintain infrastructure, services, and security, with an army that was poorly trained, inadequately equipped, and badly led, and a fractured political structure consisting of four semi-autonomous regions and a weak and factious “central” government in the capital of Leopoldville (Kinshasa today). The US ambassador in the early 1960s, Clare Timberlake, sympathized with the Agency officers he worked with: “Every time I look at this truly discouraging mess, I shudder over the painfully slow, frustrating and costly job ahead for the UN and US if the Congo is to really be helped. On the other hand, we can’t let go of this bull’s tail."

  These covert activities included: Support to labor unions and student groups, UN positions to favour the Government, Parliamentary manoeuvring advice, aid to leftist groups, peaceful demonstrations, etc. Once these activities concluded upon success, the CIA then engaged in a paramilitary activity to support the Government in defeating Chinese/Cuban/Russian-backed terrorists. These groups engaged in mass killings, rape, and torture. CIA provided key support to the rescue effort with the Congolese Government, and the Red Cross, to save 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by these terrorists. The terrorists executed a number of these innocent people. CIA also provided direct tactical support to UN peacekeeper operations.
It should be noted that Belgium, while not directly involved in Lumumba's death, did play a role in his arrest. "The [Belgium Parliamentary] inquiry concluded that Belgium wanted Lumumba arrested and, not being particularly concerned with his physical well-being, took no action to prevent his death even though it knew he probably would be killed. The report specifically denied that the Belgian government ordered Lumumba’s murder but that Belgian advisers to Lumumba’s enemies assisted in making it happen."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/static/b0454a75708171d0f7e59d3e63ef7a8b/CIAs-Covert-Ops-Congo.pdf)</sup></sup> CIA had no involvement in Prime Minster Patrice Lumumba's death in 1961.<sup>[2](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists claim the US did nothing, or worse, supported apartheid in South Africa. However, the exact opposite was true: US pressured the government with strong public condemnations, diplomatic pressures, private citizens with influence in the country, and engaged in an extensive military aid embargo, prior to the UN mandate—and more extensive.<sup>[1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210024734038&view=1up&seq=1)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951002942901y&view=1up&seq=3)</sup></sup>

- On Feb 2022, Russia illegally invaded Ukraine. Russia's justification has changed several times, as their claims are refuted: Genocide, bioweapon labs, nazism, Euromaidan, etc. Ironically, Russia's actions amount to genocide against Ukraine, due to their deliberate attempts to wipe out Ukraine via its people, its language, its culture.

- A 2000 report, by the [UNEP and IAEA experts](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/finalreport.pdf), examined Depleted Uranium (DU) munitions use in the Balkans found:
  > 1. There was no detectable, widespread contamination of the ground surface by depleted uranium. This means that any widespread contamination is present in such low levels that it cannot be detected or differentiated from the natural uranium concentration found in rocks and soil. The corresponding radiological and toxicological risks are insignificant and even non-existent.
  > 2. Detectable ground surface contamination by DU is limited to areas within a few metres of penetrators and localised points of concentrated contamination (‘contamination points’) caused by penetrator impacts. A number of contamination points were identified by the mission but most of these were found to be only slightly contaminated. The majority of the radioactivity was attached to the surrounding asphalt, concrete or soil, with some attached to the loose sand present in some penetrator holes. In many cases, the radioactivity was so low that it was hardly detectable."
  > 3. There is no significant risk related to these contamination points in terms of possible
contamination of air, water or plants. The only risk of any significance would be that
someone touched the contamination point, thereby contaminating their hands (with a risk of subsequent transfer to the mouth), or directly ingested the contaminated soil. However, with reasonable assumptions on intake of soil, the corresponding radiological risk would be insignificant, while from a toxicological point of view, the possible intake might be somewhat higher than the applicable health standards."
  > 4. No DU-contaminated water, milk, objects, or buildings were found.

- CIA has had no support to the KLA (UCK) during the Kosovo war. Scholars have concluded,  "all available evidence refutes the proposition aggressively advanced by the Milosevic regime that the KLA was mainly financed by drug and prostitution money." Indeed, a January 2000 Report to Congress confirmed that KLA wasn't running drugs to finance its operations—however some individuals may have been involved in trafficking, but the scale was unknown. KLA also was not a terrorist group. While a handful of individuals may have violated IHL, the organisation as a whole was a guerrilla group to defend against Serb attacks and atrocities. Further, during the war, its leadership ceased the call for a "greater Albania." With the introduction of international forces into the conflict, KLA agreed (and did) dismantle and demilitarise.<sup>[1](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=c033421)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/report-on-kla)</sup></sup> 

- On May 7, 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, it was alleged that the US deliberately targeted the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. This was not the case. 
   In summary, there were several crucial errors which led to the Chinese Embassy being struck:
   
   > There was an error in locating the target. The approach used to attempt to locate the FDSP building was severely flawed.

   > All sources of information used to prevent precisely this type of accident were either inaccurate or incomplete.

   > The review process did not catch the locational error and did not consult any material or any person which could have provided correct information.

   > There was in the immediate aftermath of the bombing some confusion as to what had happened and some of our early public statements were confused and contradictory. To summarize clearly and precisely: the attack on the PRC Embassy was the result of a series of errors that led to the destruction of the PRC Embassy instead of the Serb military target that was intended. The use of a map containing an error--the inaccurate location of the Chinese Embassy--contributed to the tragic mistake--but this was not due solely to a "map error." What went wrong was, first and foremost, that the approach used to locate the Bulevar Umetnosti 2, the address of the FDSP, was severely flawed.

  > Second, the databases used to check and prevent this type of targeting error were also inaccurate, incomplete, and not fully independent.

  > And third, the target review process did not detect the first two mistakes, nor did it involve people and information that could have provided additional data to correct or detect these errors.<sup>[1](https://1997-2001.state.gov/policy_remarks/1999/990617_pickering_emb.html)</sup></sup>
  
   ICTY agreed with these findings, and found no war crime had occurred. ICTY examined a number of high-profile incidents conspiracy theorists claim are examples of war crimes by NATO.
  
   Grdelica train bombing is not a war crime. Per the independent findings of ICTY, "62. It is the opinion of the committee that the bridge was a legitimate military objective. The passenger train was not deliberately targeted. The person controlling the bombs, pilot or WSO, targeted the bridge and, over a very short period of time, failed to recognize the arrival of the train while the first bomb was in flight. The train was on the bridge when the bridge was targeted a second time and the bridge length has been estimated at 50 meters (Wenz study para 6 g above at p.25). It is the opinion of the committee that the information in relation to the attack with the first bomb does not provide a sufficient basis to initiate an investigation. The committee has divided views concerning the attack with the second bomb in relation to whether there was an element of recklessness in the conduct of the pilot or WSO. Despite this, the committee is in agreement that, based on the criteria for initiating an investigation (see para. 5 above), this incident should not be investigated. In relation to whether there is information warranting consideration of command responsibility, the committee is of the view that there is no information from which to conclude that an investigation is necessary into the criminal responsibility of persons higher in the chain of command."
   
   The Attack on the Djakovica Convoy on 14/4/99, ICTY finds, "It is the opinion of the committee that civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident. While there is nothing unlawful about operating at a height above Yugoslav air defences, it is difficult for any aircrew operating an aircraft flying at several hundred miles an hour and at a substantial height to distinguish between military and civilian vehicles in a convoy. In this case, most of the attacking aircraft were F16s with a crew of one person to fly the aircraft and identify the target. As soon as the crews of the attacking aircraft became aware of the presence of civilians, the attack ceased."

- In 1999, the United States-led NATO effort engaged in major [military operation](https://www.airforcemag.com/PDF/DocumentFile/Documents/2005/Kosovo_013100.pdf) for 78 days—to end the atrocities committed by the Serbian regime in Kosovo. The major goals were:
  - Ensuring the stability of Eastern Europe. Serb aggression in Kosovo directly threatened peace throughout the Balkans and thereby the stability of all of southern Europe. There was no natural boundary to this violence, which had already moved through Slovenia and Croatia to Bosnia.
  - Thwarting ethnic cleansing. The Belgrade regime's cruel repression in Kosovo, driving thousands from their homes, created a humanitarian crisis of staggering proportions. Milosevic's campaign, which he dubbed "Operation Horseshoe", would have led to even more homeless, starvation, and loss of life had his ruthlessness gone unchecked.
  - Ensuring NATO's credibility. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia signed agreements in October 1998 that were to be verified by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and monitored by NATO. in the period leading up to March 1999, Serbian forces increasingly and flagrantly violated these agreements. Had NATO not responded to Milosevic's defiance and his campaign of ethnic cleansing, its credibility would have have been called into question.
   
  The US/NATO campaign, Operation Allied Force—was in [full compliance with international law](https://archive.org/details/legalethicalless78wall/mode/2up).
   Indeed, the International Tribunal has ruled all aspects of the campaign were [lawful](https://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal#IVB4).<sup>[1](https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/casestudy/media/pap01_aar.pdf)</sup></sup>
   
- In 1995, during the Bosnian war, Operation Deny Flight transitioned to [Operation Deliberate Force](https://www.airforcemag.com/article/1097deliberate/), after  artillery shells killed 38 civilians and injured 85 others, by Serb forces. The air campaign resulted in few civilian casualties, and ended the civil conflict. Indeed, experts [have documented](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Books/B_0074_OWEN_DELIBERATE_FORCE.pdf) the Operation's efforts to avoid civilian casualties and applaud its efforts and results, "constraints on force application  entailed  avoiding collateral effects and unintended consequences that would be counterproductive to the political peace process. This effort to avoid collateral and unintended damage extended not only to the surrounding  physical targets but also to concerns about fratricide, refugees, and noncombatant civilian casualties. The need for precision offensive air operations (OAS) platforms and weapons to limit  collateral damage while accomplishing mission objectives became  an overriding concern during the Balkans air campaign. Thus, precision-guided munitions (PGM) became the overwhelming weapons of choice during air  strike operations. Indeed, Deliberate Force became the first air campaign in history to employ more precision-guided bombs and missiles than unguided ones."
 
- On 9 October 1992, UN Security Council passed resolution 781, which prohibited unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone, but it did not take action against violators of the resolution. In response to over 500 documented violations, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures "to ensure compliance" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. NATO's [Operation Deny Flight](https://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/459001/operation-deny-flight/), which lasted from April 12, 1993 to Dec 20, 1995, enforced this UNSCR compliance.

- Able Archer, in 1983, didn't come close to starting a nuclear war, as many revisionists allege. Simon Miles, in his earth-shattering examination, reviewed declassified records from various countries to prove the origins of this claim stem from Soviet disinformation.<sup>[1](https://direct.mit.edu/jcws/article-abstract/22/3/86/95296/The-War-Scare-That-Wasn-t-Able-Archer-83-and-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/discussions/7415273/h-diplo-article-review-1024-war-scare-wasn%E2%80%99t)</sup></sup>

- Between 1948-1956, Italy, the CIA aided centrists; socially/economically left-wing governments; labor unions; student groups and other socialist groups to provide political stability in preventing Soviet-backed right-wing authortarian groups to take hold—leading to a decade of democratic socialism. In total, only $3 million was provided to these various groups. A study finding, "The defeat of the Right meant that Communism's threat would be met through democratic politics, not a reversion to Fascism. The strength of the Socialists, even without aid from the outside, meant that left-wing sentiment looked toward a democratic form of socialism."<sup>[1](https://ia801601.us.archive.org/14/items/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-1956/Combating-Communism-Italy-1953-56.pdf)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the CIA and NATO, supported right-wing terror groups in Italy from the 50s to the 90s, under "Operation Gladio". This claim has been long-discredited by a large number of Cold War historians, and the USG, as a forged document by the USSR. It should be noted that there were stay behind networks, run by EU nations—these were pure intel collection groups in case of Soviet invasion. No evidence exists CIA operated any, let alone that any did the aforementioned charge.<sup>[1](https://www.scribd.com/document/114855262/Misinformation-About-Gladio-Stay-Behind-Networks-Resurfaces)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402390701676485)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://direct.mit.edu/jcws/article-abstract/16/4/35/13485/Stay-Behind-A-Clandestine-Cold-War-Phenomenon?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02684520500340357)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390500448524)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850600500332656)</sup></sup> <sup>[7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16161262.2005.10555113)</sup></sup> <sup>[8](https://www.cia.gov/static/9f3bcb469cee52fd1017f1c7c84aeadc/intel-officers-bookshelf-11.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- The list claims the CIA installed Georgios Papadopoulos in a Greece military coup in 1967. The list cited a wiki entry that contradicts the allegation, and confirms it was just that: An allegation. The wiki entry states, "during William Colby's confirmation hearing to be Director of Central Intelligence, Colby was asked by Stuart Symington, chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, if there was any justification for the assertions. Colby [replied](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074749253&view=2up&seq=7) that he had the allegations researched and found that the CIA had not engineered the coup, Papadopoulos was not an agent of the CIA, and that Papadopoulos was never paid by the CIA."

- It has been alleged that the CIA was involved in the Hungarian revolution against the brutal, authortarian Communist Stalinist regime; that the US signaled it would covertly, or overtly, help the democratic movement against the regime and USSR forces and that it had turned a blind-eye to the democratic revolution. However, a comprensive and authoritative declassified study reveals this isn't true. While the US was sympathtic to the Hungarian people, and pressing diplomacy at the UN, it was trying to avoid another world war: By disrupting the Soviet Union's atrocities agaisnt the movement, whilst also dealing with global matters that could have also sparked global conflict, such as the Suez crisis.<sup>[1](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/MDR_Releases/FY12/12-M-1691.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/3473778/Document-01-Almost-Successful-Recipe-The-United.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Adolf Heusinger was not a nazi nor war criminal, despite pundit accusations. Promoted to colonel on 1 August 1940 and became chief of the Operationsabteilung in October 1940, which made him number three in the army's planning hierarchy, after the Chief of the General Staff, General Franz Halder, and the Deputy Chief of the General Staff/Chief Quartermaster, General Friedrich Paulus. After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the OKH became responsible primarily for planning operations in that theatre, and the Armed Forces High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW) was responsible for other theatres. Halder was replaced as Chief of the General Staff in September 1942 by General Kurt Zeitzler. Heusinger remained chief of the Operationsabteilung and was promoted to Generalleutnant on 1 January 1943. In June 1944, Zeitzler suffered a nervous breakdown and abandoned his post, and on 10 June, Heusinger temporarily assumed his office as Chief of the General Staff of the Army. In this capacity, he attended the meeting at Hitler's Wolf's Lair on 20 July 1944, and he was standing next to Hitler when the bomb exploded that had been planted by Claus von Stauffenberg.

  Heusinger was hospitalised for his injuries in the explosion but was later arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo to determine his role, if any, in the 20 July Plot. 
  
  Since he was not accused of being a nazi, or a war criminal, he provided key testimony in the WW2 Tribunals. Heusinger's personal beliefs and political views were that of pro-democracy, and naturally found himself in support of the free West. Because of his skills in military planning operations. With the establishment of the West Germany Armed Forces Bundeswehr in 1955, Heusinger returned to military service. He was appointed a Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) on 12 November 1955, in the Bundeswehr and chairman of the Military Leadership Council.
  
  Shortly thereafter, in June 1957, Heusinger was promoted to full general and named the first Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, and he served in that capacity until March 1961. In April 1961, he was appointed Chair of the NATO Military Committee for Germany until 1964. The US had no say on this.<sup>[1](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/who_is_who_134296.htm)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123033424/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/HEUSINGER%2C%20ADOLF_0006.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1949, the CIA supported the resistance movement against the oppressive, authoritarian Hoxha dictatorship in Albania. This was done through psychological and intelligence operations—which was widely supported by the local population, despite knowing the risks should they be found out by their oppressors. CIA's operation however, was not an attempt to overthrow this regime—it was to harass it, to make it unappealing to the Soviet empire. <sup>[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684527.2020.1754711?journalCode=fint20)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://josefmuehlbauer.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/obopus-bg-fiend-cia-operation-albania.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20150401215624/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/1705143/OBOPUS%20BGFIEND%20%20%20VOL.%2020%20%20%28BGFIEND%20OPERATIONS%29_0012.pdf)</sup></sup>

- It was alleged that the CIA's predecessor, OSS—was involved in aiding Nazi war criminals to further US Scientific inquiry and Intelligence operations, under "operation paperclip." This is a distortion of truth. It has been confirmed that there was no operation to rescue criminals from prosecution. As Allan Ryan, former Director of the Office of Special Investigation (the office to which Nazis were prosecuted) said,"From time to time in the past few years, books or other accounts have appeared claiming to expose some newly-discovered conspiracy by CIA, or the military, or a cabal of lawless bureaucrats, to bring Nazi collaborators to the United States after the war." "These accounts," according to Ryan, "have offered dubious evidence and have been unable to survive any objective analysis. 

  In a landmark treatise of all CIA files, and public accounting, Historian Kevin Ruffner examines the role of PL 110, Sec 8. which has been misconstrued as the legal authority for this alleged Nazi smuggling. The purpose and use of this law was to facilitate defectors, including Communist defectors. No Nazi war criminals were permitted to enter, nor did any. Out of the total number of immigrants permitted to the US, between 1949 and 1982, only 3 may have had a connection to nazism. Another 3 had served in the German army and 3 in the Vlasov army. Ruffner concludes, "What can be summarized as the legacy of the Agency's Cold War defector program? Initially, OSS wanted to reward its European agents for faithful service during the war. Within months, however, this changed as the Soviets drew a tighter grip over Eastern Europe and the Americans found it necessary to evacuate its covert personnel from danger. The United States did not have a set plan to permit the emigration of its agents from Europe or to deal with defectors or deserters from the Soviet bloc. As a result, SSU, CIG, and CIA gradually slipped into the role as the responsible agency to handle defectors and their resettlement. By 1949, the problem of how to deal with these people had become critical, especially in Germany. New laws, such as the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 and the CIA Act of 1949, provided some help, but the NSC intelligence directives gave real direction to the Agency. After 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency was fully committed to using defectors as a weapon in fighting the Cold War. While an imperfect weapon, CIA did not deliberately use its position to "smuggle" Nazis out of Europe or to bring them or their collaborators to the United States.<sup>[1](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf#page=410)</sup></sup>
  
  As for Barbie: The 1983 Ryan report, concluded, "at no time from the end of World War II to the present time has the Central Intelligence Agency had any relationship with Klaus Barbie." He also determined that the "CIA was not involved in the use, control, or financing" of the rat line from Austria to Italy and then to South America that allowed Barbie to escape in 1951. Further, "the united States government has had no relationship of any kind with Klaus Barbie since he departed from Europe in 1951." As for the timeline and the Army's CIC: CIC personnel had no reliable indication until at least May 1949, some two years after Barbie was first employed, that he was suspected of war crimes or crimes against humanity. Not until the summer of 1950 did the French provide the evidence to the US Government. Further, it was not offered to, and was not reasonably available to, CIC officials, who had no reason even to know that it existed." A handful of CIC personnel misled HICOG's attempts to carry out its lawful obligation to decide the extradition of Klaus Barbie."<sup>[2](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-hrsp/legacy/2011/02/04/08-02-83barbie-rpt.pdf#page=212)</sup></sup>
  
  As for Otto von Bolschwing: He mostly lied and misled the CIA about his Nazi past in 1954. Not until 1960 did CIA learn of Bolschwing's larger role in the SS.<sup>[3](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000477271_0.pdf#page=12)</sup></sup>

  The CIA, (more than any), aided in bringing such justice in aiding the DOJ's OSI. In his role as director of the OSI, Ryan wrote, "no Federal agency, including the CIA, ever objected to any prosecution or tried to call off any investigation."<sup>[4](https://ia801301.us.archive.org/17/items/EagleAndSwastika/Eagle%20and%20Swastika.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://web.archive.org/web/20201018014445/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol40no5/pdf/v40i5a12p.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- Between 1945-1947, the OSS, and later CIA—briefly, worked with Ukrainian emigre groups after WW2. In 1947, the Central Intelligence Group approved USSR's extradition request for Bandera (after initial resistance), as well as ceasing intelligence gathering contact with the OUN, because of "the increasingly totalitarian attitude taken by Bandera." Due to ethics concerns, "by the spring of 1947 Munich base had orders to stop its work with the various emigre groups, especially the Ukrainians." Thus, all ties to groups were cut. CIA conducted another study in 1948 on various Ukraine groups to support and found that ZPUHVR would be suitable because, "ZPUHVR leaders have demonstrated that they are not interested in personal gain or profit... and has as kept itself morally and politically uncommitted and uncompromised over a period of three years." It should also be noted that Lebed and Hrinioch broke with Bandera's OUN in 1948.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/STUDIES%20IN%20INTELLIGENCE%20NAZI%20-%20RELATED%20ARTICLES_0015.pdf)</sup></sup>

- At the end of World War II, the US undertook, with allied forces, an unprecedented effort to remove the stain of Nazism from Germany, and rebuild the nation.

Of note was their US' efforts to combat hunger, disease outbreaks, etc. As detailed in this authoritative, independent [Official History](https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/bookviewer?PID=nlm:nlmuid-9009947-bk#page/570/mode/2up) from the Medical Department, US Army.

- The Rheinwiesenlager (Rhine meadow camps) were a group of 19 US prison camps built in the Allied-occupied part of Germany to hold captured German soldiers at the close of the Second World War. The US and allied forces did their best to [maintain compliance with international law, and did](https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-1278003RX7-mvpart), with regards to detention operations of captive Germans. However, due to unforeseen issues such as the overwhelming numbers of German troop surrender, far more than planned—the Allied forces struggled to maintain sanitation conditions and other needs. They did improve overtime, but struggled. No Geneva violations occurred. Only 2,754 POWs died due to disease.

- In April 1945, the German [Concentration camp](https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/research/online-documents/holocaust/report-dachau.pdf) Dachau was liberated by US forces.

- In Sicily, 1943, at the Biscari airfield, Sergeant Horace T. West of the 180th  Infantry  Regiment, singlehandedly murdered 37 POWs. This was reported by LTC William E. King, the Division Chaplain. At this same location, though hours apart, CPT John T. Compton ordered a few of his men to kill a 36 POWs. Both cases were independently investigated and corroborated. Major General Troy H. Middleton convened a general court-martial for both men. West was found guilty, sentenced to life in prison. Compton's men didn't face Court-martial, since they acted under the orders of Compton, per Field Manual (FM) 27-10, Rules of Land Warfare, "Individuals of the armed forces will not be punished for these offenses in case they are committed under orders or sanction of their government or commanders. The commanders ordering the commission of such acts, or under whose authority they are committed by their troops, may be punished by the belligerent into whose hands they may fall." However, this also provided a defense in Compton's case—as, he claimed he was acting under the orders of General Patton. General Patton was cleared of wrong-doing by a seperate IG investigation. His speech didn't order killing of POWs, however it was misinterpreted as such. Since Compton thought he was acting on orders in good faith.<sup>[1](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/03-2013.pdf)</sup></sup>

## Asia

- In 2004, the Toledo Blade ran a series detailing alleged war crimes committed by "Tiger Force" in Vietnam. On 3 Feb, 1971, a former member of the 101st Airborne Division reported that a number of personnel from the Tiger Force Recon Platoon committed war crimes in South Vietnam, 1967. The Blade's series generally just repeated  and editorialized the allegations. However, a 2004 review of the paper's allegations of inconsistencies with the ROI found, “are attributed to misrepresentation of the facts and testimonial evidence being taken out of context.” The original report found most war crime allegations made in '71 were without merit. However, some were unable to be proven/disproven—and a few were found to be credible. Many of the credible cases had no action taken because those implicated were KIA in 1967, or were unidentified.<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/tiger-force)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged the US Government aided Khmer Rouge, an organisation supported by China and other Communist states. The US engaged in a highly successful bombing campaign against the terror org. It has been confirmed <sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20201120133711/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP90M00005R001000080038-7.pdf)</sup></sup> that the US had no involvement in aiding the org, "Since the fall of 1986 we have received reports about a letter from a Congressional Staffer alleging USG support for the Khmer Rouge. The letter was written by Jonathan Winer, counsel to Senator Kerry, and contained what were purported to be figures on annual USG support for the Khmer rouge starting in 1980. Winer claimed in his letter that the information on USG support was received from the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The allegation and figures included in Winer's letter are completely without basis in fact. The USG abhors and condemns the Khmer rouge and has never provided  any direct assistance to them. We have, however, generously supported the relief  program for displaced Cambodians on the Thai border. We also assist the Cambodian noncommunist resistance forces led by Prince Sihanouk and Son Sann in their struggle against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. We have initiated stringent safeguards in both programs to ensure that the assistances does not end up with the Khmer Rouge. The Congressional Research Service has denied any knowledge of the information attributed to it." 
  
  In 1978, President Carter issued a statement condemning the actions of the Democratic Kampuchea government and, importantly, used the word ‘genocide’ in his statement. In response to increased Khmer Rouge incursions into Vietnamese territory, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in December 1978.
  
  Famine was rife. Food stocks were dwindling due to disruptions in the harvest cycle caused by the invasion of Vietnamese troops, 150,000 of whom would remain in Cambodia for most of the decade. Some 300,000 Cambodian refugees lived in UN-administered camps along the Thai border, but only 10% were given refugee status, meaning the vast majority would spend the decade in limbo. International development groups, responding to the misery of the camps, poured into the border area to begin administering aid. The United States contributed $15 million per year in humanitarian assistance through organizations such as UNICEF and the International Committee for the Red Cross. As early as 1981, this aid began to have an impact on conditions in the camps, with the malnutrition rate among children falling from 50% to 2.5% in less than a year.
  
  It has also been alleged that the US "supported" the Khmer Rouge's seat at the UN, however, it's more nuanced than that, and also wrong. Beginning in 1979, and continuing throughout the 1980s, the United States – along with China, ASEAN and others – voted to allow the anti-government coalition to hold Cambodia’s seat at the United Nations. The United States argued that the PRK government was illegitimate since it was imposed by a foreign invasion, and it was consistent with international law to seat the predecessor government. US Government's position was that a country should not be deprived of representation at the United Nations simply because other Governments dislike that country's politics or find it morally objectionable. However, it welcomed the opportunity if a Supreme National Council was formed in time to present credentials for the next session of the UN General Assembly. The US tried to pressure Khmer Rouge out of the coalition government. In February and March of 1985, U.S. Representative Stephen Solarz, a Democrat from New York with a keen interest in developments in Cambodia, attempted to change the nature of U.S. support for these groups. Solarz proposed a $5 million package of overt, non-lethal aid; direct U.S. support for the groups up to that point had been covert and non-lethal, at $12 million per year. On May 15, the Senate approved a version of Solarz’ proposal. The House of Representatives then voted to pass the legislation in July, and President Reagan signed the bill on August 8, 1985. For the first time, U.S. non-lethal aid to the non-communist resistance would be overt, reaching a total of $15 million over the next three years.
 
  U.S. policy throughout the decade was to end Vietnamese military involvement in Cambodia and replace the Vietnamese-backed People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government with one that represented the will of the people. To that end, the United States, under the Reagan and Bush administrations, supported political and popular resistance to the PRK government, which was headed by Khmer Rouge defectors. In February 1991, China announced that it would resume military aid to the Khmer Rouge. The United States, in an effort to assure the international community that it would not tolerate the return of Pol Pot to power, suspended all aid to the non-communist resistance because of its cooperation with the Khmer Rouge.<sup>[2](https://www.gao.gov/assets/t-nsiad-90-63.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101004254/https://kh.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/book_us_cambodia_relations.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137364098_5)</sup></sup>

- There has been an increasing number of US veterans alleging exposure to Herbicide Orange while serving at military installations in Okinawa during the Vietnam Era. Some specific allegations published by the The Japan Times and other news outlets: Herbicide Orange and tactical herbicides were tested and evaluated in the jungle areas of Okinawa in 1961 – 1962; Beginning in 1962 in Project AGILE, Herbicide Orange and other tactical herbicides were shipped to or through, unloaded on, or used in Okinawa by the US Department of Defense during the Vietnam War; Shipments of the remaining surplus inventory of “25,000 barrels” of Herbicide Orange from Vietnam were sent to Okinawa prior to shipment to Johnston Island in 1971 during Operation RED HAT; Large quantities of Herbicide Orange were buried “in and around Chatan Town at Hamby Air Field” , and/or “buried at White Beach near the Machinato Supply Depot (Service Area)”, and/or “buried near the Futenma Air Station near the city of Ginowan”; Numerous US Vietnam-era veterans stationed in Okinawa handled and sprayed Herbicide Orange, or were witnesses to it being sprayed by a C-123; and, Some veterans stationed at Kadena Air Base cleaned the C-123 aircraft contaminated from spraying Herbicide Orange. However, an independent, comprehensive investigation concluded, "after an extensive search of all known and available records, there were no documents found that validated the allegations that Herbicide Orange was involved in any of these events, nor were there records to validate that Herbicide Orange was shipped to or through, unloaded, used or buried on Okinawa."<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111003/http://denix.osd.mil/shf/upload/Allegations-of-Herbicide-Orange-on-Okinawa-January-2013.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Many groundbreaking, authoritative monographs of US activities, attitudes and policy decisions towards Asia have been written, and provide the most detailed, in-depth examination of several decades:

  - [US Intelligence and Vietnam](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123192047/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001433692.pdf) provides a detailed examination of finished intelligence relating to the Vietnam conflict from the time of introduction of US combat forces in 1965 through the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975. In settling on the scope of the study, it was decided to go back to the beginning of the American involvement in Indochina toward the end of World War II and cover at least the major developments that occurred during a period of approximately three decades. 1945-1975.
  - [CIA and the House of Ngo](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/2_CIA_AND_THE_HOUSE_OF_NGO.pdf) notes how the CIA aided in establishing a civilian government in South Vietnam. As Diem became more authoritarian and suppressive of minorities, the US tried to persuade him to abide by human rights, however, upon this failing, encouraged but was not involved in, the coup by the military. Ahern traces CIA efforts to bring stability and democracy to South Vietnam and to influence Diem. Although not uncritical of US policy and CIA operations, Ahern's study reveals a CIA Station-indeed in the early years, two Stations-working diligently and effectively to aid Diem in forming a viable state.
  - [CIA and the Generals](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/1_CIA_AND_THE_GENERALS.pdf)  "illustrates Saigon Station efforts to work with and understand the various military governments of South Vietnam which followed Diem, and carefully details CIA attempts to stabilize and urge democratization on the changing military regimes."
  - [CIA and Rural pacification](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/3_CIA_AND_RURAL_PACIFICATION.pdf) details CIA's efforts to win the "hearts and minds" of the South Vietnamese rural population. It's a compelling account of CIA's contributions to the US effort to establish and preserve an independent nation in South Vietnam. Despite local success, the CIA effort was, in the end, part of a major tragedy. No one, either in Washington or in the field, grasped the immense complexity and difficulty in instituting a massive effort to control the contryside, win the support of the peasantry, and promote political reforms, while fighting a determined and entrenched enemy.

- Between 1964 and 1975, it is claimed that the US bombing campaign led to a poverty trap in Vietnam. However, the academic literature disputes this unfounded claim.
  "U.S. bombing does not have negative impacts on local poverty rates, consumption levels, infrastructure, literacy or population density through 2002. This finding indicates that even the most intense bombing in human history did not generate local poverty traps in Vietnam."<sup>[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387810000817)</sup></sup> 
  
-  In 1998, CNN and Time alleged that during the Vietnam war, a US Special Forces unit was sent into Laos to hunt down US defectors—by killing an entire village of civilians, and using Sarin gas to finish them off, under "Operation Tailwind. "This sensational headline spurred two independent reviews: One by CNN, the other by the Pentagon that ordered the Army, Air Force and JCS to conduct investigations each: After interviewing pilots, planners, and all else involved, as well as extensive document review: All found the allegation baseless. Operation Tailwind was a rescue mission of Special Forces personnel. They deployed tear gas to suppress enemy fire, and recover their men. The review also confirmed that the US never deployed and chemical or biological weapons to Southeast Asia. After CNN's own independent investigation, they apologised and retracted the article.<sup>[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1081180X99004001007)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20041105234814/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/tailwind.html)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://media.defense.gov/2011/Jan/12/2001330001/-1/-1/0/TAILWIND-complete.pdf)</sup></sup>

- It is charged by political pundists that the US Military during the Vietnam war, the stratergy was strategy of civilian slaughter sanctioned by American leaders—not only is this contradicted by the Rules of Engagement, as detailed in the following sections—but as  Fred L. Borch, a Military Historian & Archivist finds, "The vast majority of professional historians reject this view; they do not find that the historical record supports the conclusion that war crimes resulted from institutional flaws in the Army and its culture. In his highly acclaimed [America in Vietnam](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/america-in-vietnam-9780195027327?cc=cz&lang=en&#), political scientist Guenter Lewy examined American strategy and tactics in Vietnam between 1961 and 1975, and analyzed hundreds of after action reports of military operations, command directive, field reports, and staff studies of pacification efforts. He also looked at courts-martial records and war crimes investigations. Lewy concluded that “charges of officially condoned illegal and grossly illegal conduct are without substance.” As Lewy demonstrates, the Army did not ignore misconduct by its Soldiers. On the contrary, the Army “kept statistics on the number of [war crimes] allegations made and their disposition.” For Lewy, this was proof that the Army as an institution was not turning a blind eye to war crimes committed by Americans in uniform. In Vietnam, senior commanders in fact took their responsibilities under the law of armed conflict seriously."

  In [Law at War: Vietnam 1964-1973](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/law-at-war/law-at-war.pdf), an official study published by the Army’s Center of Military History, author George S. Prugh explains that the Commander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), considered creating special war crimes teams (to both investigate and prosecute these offenses). Ultimately, however, General William C. Westmoreland decided that this was not needed since the laws prohibiting war crimes were clear and the administrative and judicial machinery for investigating and punishing such offenses was sufficient. Westmoreland did, however, establish detailed rules governing the investigation of war crimes. Of particular importance is MACV Directive 20-4, which not only required the reporting of any war crime alleged to have been committed by U.S. personnel, but made it a criminal offense to fail to make such report. Finally, it was American military lawyers in Vietnam who were responsible for convincing their South Vietnamese counterparts that the 1949 Geneva Conventions were applicable to the conflict (thereby ensuring that international law governed the treatment of enemy combatants), and that it was Army lawyers who, intent on complying with the Conventions, authored rules governing the treatment of detained persons, including innocent civilians and civil defendants." 

  An Inspector General report found, "It was United States , MACV, and Service policy to adhere to the laws of war, including not only the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Convention, but also those found in Hague Conventions Number IV and those established by customary international law. In addition, specific restrictions were imposed on our forces in South Vietnam that went beyond these Conventions. These restrictions, imposed to minimize civilian casualties, reduce the chance of an inadvertent strike into an inhabited area, protect religious monuments, public buildings, and areas of cultural interest, were applicable to forces in the field and to all levels of command in the target selection process. The policies of the Services do not support a conclusion that bombing of hospitals or other facilities protected by the Geneva Conventions would be condoned. On the contrary, we may have suffered additional casualties because of our self-imposed restrictions."<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/hospital-bombing-investigation-Nam)</sup></sup>
 
- In the 1975 Australian Constitutional Crisis, CIA nor Royal Crown had any involvement in the dismissal.

- During the Vietnam war, the US deployed herbicides to allow better troop movement in the jungle. This was known as Operation Ranch Hand.
Unknown to the US, one of its agents, agent orange, was toxic. Agent Orange was actually safe, however, a contamination issue occurred during the manufacture of 2,4,5,T. This was what was toxic: 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). [Contamination](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780306422478) was between less than 0.05 to almost 50 parts per million, with a mean of about 2 parts per million. As noted by the [National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/items/show/1318), "Until early 1973, there were no analytical techniques available with sensitivity and specificity sufficient to detect the extremely small quantities of TCDD likely to be present in the environment." This, of course, means that the contamination of TCDD couldn't be detected between 1961 and 1971.  Allegations that it was used to harm/kill combatants or civilians is [false](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/98481.pdf). The US did deploy one of its agents [_briefly_ to target _few, select_ crops belonging to the viet cong](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/28/2001329797/-1/-1/0/AFD-100928-054.pdf). The Americans were very reluctant to do this, however, South Vietnam insisted its use. The US only accepted under very strict controls & criteria, and if the South Government would guarantee humanitarian supplies should it be needed. 

- Napalm, Cluster munitions and other incendiary bombs were used in Vietnam. Their deployment was subject to careful approval on select military targets only, and after CIVCAS mitigation efforts were completed, thus satisfactory to the Geneva Conventions. Interestingly, "Available factual data suggest that the air delivery of the fire bomb on the target can be accomplished with extreme accuracy in close air support of troops on the ground. Far example, fire bombs in this role are generally dropped from an altitude of 50-350 feet when the attack aircraft is not further than 1,000 feet from the target. Delivery accuracy under typical conditions is said to be within 100 feet with an area of effectiveness, elliptical in shape, approximately 120 meters long and 25 meters wide. Alternative weapons are indicated as having substantially larger maximum effective areas, thus tending to disprove the contention that the fire bomb is a weapon with an unusually large area of effectiveness with attendant indiscriminate effects against civilians and civilian property."<sup>[1](https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/2251871/View+the+PDF/ee82f732-b0b4-4275-b230-5be04ad16474#page=101)</sup></sup>  

- In July 1972, the Hanoi propaganda effort ramped up, claiming the US deliberately attacked several Dikes, causing civilian casualties. However, an [independent, internal review](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T00875R001700040062-8.pdf) confirmed this not to be the case. "A study of available photography shows conclusively that there has been no concerted and intentional bombing of North Vietnam's vital dike system. A few dikes have been hit, apparently by stray bombs directed at military-associated targets nearby. The observable damage is minor and no major dike has been breached."

- Between 1965 and 1971, US bombing of Cambodia, such as MENU, with Cambodian consent to stop Viet Cong forces from operating within the territory, resulted in only 343 civilian deaths and 639 wounded, according to a JSC study.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/LOC-HAK-449-5-3-5.pdf)</sup></sup> It is also argued by some that the Communist attack on civilians in Saigon on June 7, 1969 were retalitory for US bombing their forces in Cambodia. However, a review of attacks confirms this narrative is false.<sup>[2](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/LOC-HAK-553-4-6-7.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://archive.org/details/cambodia-laos-review)</sup></sup>

- Operation Linebacker 1, from May 9 to October 23, 1972 and Operation Linebacker 2, from December 18 to December 29, 1972 were bombing campaigns against North Vietnam. North Vietnam illegally invaded South Vietnam, which triggered Operation Linebacker 1, targeting their military supply lines, etc. This was a successful effort in forcing the North to the peace table. However, the North Vietnam Government stalled peace talks, while trying to secretly build their forces. This prompted the Nixon Admin to begin Linebacker 2. A shorter campaign that while effective, was surrounded by disinformation alleging "indiscriminate targeting of civilians". An [independent assessment](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA191278/page/n1/mode/2up) concludes, "that the Linebacker campaigns were militarily effective and that, had AFP 110-31 been in effect in 1972, the campaigns, as they were actually conducted, would have conformed to the pamphlet's restrictions on aerial bombardment. These campaigns demonstrate that the pamphlet's rules on aerial bombardment are practical and can be complied with, given the proper technology and a conscious effort by commanders, their staffs, and aircrews."
 
   A [scholarly paper](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/1983_Vol34_No1-6/1983_Vol34_No2.pdf) from W. Hays Park, a world-leading LOAC expert, also confirms these operations were in compliance with international law, and details the efforts to mitigate collateral damage and civilian casualties. He concludes, "Both Linebacker campaigns were also conducted with an acute awareness by the military of its responsibilities under the law of war, with mission parameters well within the prohibitions of the law. Although unprecedented in the degree of precaution taken by an attacker to minimize collateral injury to the civilian population of an enemy, each campaign was successful  in attaining its objectives." 
   
- In 1971, Bangladesh fought for independence in East Pakistan. Declassified cables confirm that the US provided no arms or military equipment to Pakistan since 1965, up and through the 1971 episode, instead electing to provide humanitarian aid. The US also ceased military sales to India. The US was vocal in calling out the atrocities, but not as much as they would have liked, due to concerns of the safety of Americans in the region.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20050702002716/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/48053.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/xi/45607.htm)</sup></sup>  

- In 1970, in Cambodia, the CIA had no involvement in Prince Sihanouk's vote of no confidence. The list's own wiki citation even admits there is no evidence. It is alleged this had US involvement because of the view from the US that Cambodia was being used to supply weapons to the VC/NVA. However, a detailed study by Historian Ahern finds that the CIA, from 1965-1969 was split on the evidence intelligence suggested of such covert support by Sihanouk. Indeed, CIA scrapped all prior intel in 1969 to study from scratch, "OER undertook a comprehensive review, not only of the evidence but also of its own analytical methodology. Proceeding from primary reporting, the new effort would ignore all published analyses. Its objectivity would be assured by having it conducted by an officer without previous exposure to Cambodian analysis." However, ONE still leaned that the evidence wasn't enough, and downplayed key intelligence concerning the overland route. By 1970, however, the question was settled: Sihanouk had abandoned neutrality. Indeed, internal biases of sympathy existed in the CIA towards Prince Sihanouk, even as early as 1964: "Several participants in the debate later came to see individual and institutional bias as encouraging resistance to serious consideration of Sihanoukville as a major transit point for arms. [redacted] believed that service in Cambodia tended to generate sympathy for Sihanouk's position, as the Prince struggled to save his country with a neutralist balancing act. [redacted] remembered his own stance as open to Sihanouk's complicity in the arms traffic, but he agreed that pro-Sihanouk feeling was common [redacted]. But the phenomenon existed also at CIA. [redacted] remembered having absorbed the sentiment in OCI in the mid-1960s. He also recalled a visit to DDI Ray Cline's office, sometime in 1964, where Cline advised him to "take it easy on the Cambodians." [redacted] interpreted this cryptic guidance as suggesting he "cut Sihanouk some slack" when interpreting allegations of collusion with the VC/NVA that were already circulating." Official North Vietnamese histories published in 1994 and 1995 confirmed the use of Cambodia in trafficking: Chief editor, Nguyen Duy Tuong History of the Annamite Mountain Troops of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, "that the Lao Dong Party's Central Office for South Vietnam set up Rear Services Group 17 in July 1966 "in the friendly nation of Cambodia." Under the name "Hak Ly Company," it "established purchasing offices in a number of different areas in Cambodia." and Col. Gen. Tran Van Quang, Review of the Resistance War Against the Americans, "between 1966 and 1969, we shipped 21,400 tones of supplies through the port of Sihanoukville and paid the government more than 50 millionUS dollars in port fees and transportation charges."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/4_GOOD_QUESTIONS_WRONG_ANSWERS.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1965, the United States with South Vietnam the air campaign under the [Rolling Thunder program](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T02095R000900070018-0.pdf). This program resulted in [effective military gains](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00472A000800020017-1.pdf), while producing very few civilian casualties: Between [3,900 and 5,400](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T02095R000900070009-0.pdf) and [34,000, of which 21,000 were killed](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78S02149R000200020003-4.pdf) by then-standards. The second study reviews all propaganda claims made by the North Vietnam regime and concludes most of them false and inaccurate. The purpose of the program was to impede the North regime's supply of weapons and men to aid insurgent groups in the South, and in the long-term make continued physical support to insurgents too costly for North Vietnam. Another detailed overview of the program can be found [here](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80T01629R000300080014-9.pdf) From target selection to casualty estimates, to goals, etc. A [study](https://web.archive.org/web/20161106133619/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/parks.html) by one of the world's leading law of war experts, concludes that it complied with, and far exceeded international law,"Rolling Thunder was one of the most constrained military campaigns in history. The restrictions imposed by this nation’s civilian leaders were not based on the law of war but on an obvious ignorance of the law —to the detriment of those sent forth to battle."

- Many pundits and historical revisionists allege the US was behind the 1965 coup in Indonesia. The 30 September Movement. This couldn't be furthest from the truth. In the declassified publication, _[The lessons of the September 30 affair](https://web.archive.org/web/20201017175932/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol14no2/pdf/v14i2a02p.pdf)_ a fantastic summary of events is detailed, however a brief mention to the largest, comprehensive and authoritative study is summized, "In her study _[The Coup that backfired](https://web.archive.org/web/20171208040813/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-40.pdf)_, Ms Helen Hunter went a long way toward dispelling the myth of the Chinese Communist involvement in the purge attempt. She concluded that while Peking had probable learned of the Sukarno/PKI plan, as indeed it must have through agent penetration of the Palace and the PKI, the Chinese did not instigate the plot or participate in carrying it out. The same conclusion is implicit in an earlier article in _studies in Intelligence_ in _[The September 30 Movement](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123064222/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010008-4.pdf)_ by John T. Pizzicaro. Like us, the Chinese knew something important was imminent. But I doubt whether they could truly have comprehended the nature of the plot and its implications." CIA had [no involvement](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0005/7324009.pdf) in the assassination is also confirmed by the declassified Rockefeller commission. Conspiracy theorists and historical revisionists also claim that the State Department and CIA were complicit in the Indonesian purge. This is based on a distortion and misrepresentation by Kathy Kadane, in her work, to reference of individuals she relies on as sources. As a result, they wrote letters to the editor, calling her out. Scholars have  also disputed this charge. As one leading expert found, “The United States did not overthrow Sukarno, and it was not responsible for the hundreds of thousands of deaths involved in the liquidation of the PKI.”<sup>[1](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/76/3/785/760066)</sup></sup> Further, it is doubtful that the small list of names provided by Martens aided in any purges. As he points out, "the names I gave were based entirely—I repeat entirely—on the Indonesia Communist press and were available to everyone. This was a senior cadre system of the PKI—a few thousand at most out of the 3.5 million claimed party members.” Martens stressed that these lists of PKI members were “not party rank and file.” Martens also stated categorically in his letter that, “I and I alone decided to pass those ‘lists’ to the non-Communist forces. I neither sought nor was given permission to do so by Ambassador Marshall Green or any other embassy official.” Martens concluded with the statement that he did not turn over classified information nor was he the head of an Embassy group that spent 2 years compiling the lists as stated in the article in The Washington Post. He stated that there was no such group." <sup>[2](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v26/d185)</sup></sup> Yes, the CIA did produced estimates of the death toll, long after the fact. That cannot be read of their involvement. By this logic, all news orgs across the globe were involved.<sup>[3](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v26/d162)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.aim.org/publications/aim_report/1990/09b.html)</sup></sup> 

- The Vietnam war and the US' entire air campaign; counter to many historical revisionists, was actually hampered by strict Rules of Engagement that often left the Military allowing the Vietcong to remain safe, even though they're far clear of any surrounding civilian populations. In another [scholarly paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Rules-of-Engagement-for-Land-Forces%3A-A-Matter-of-Martins/7e772b364572c7a5efe69de72538444c85cf099e) by a world-leading legal expert and practitioner, it was found while studying Air Force ROEs, "the policy of gradualism, implemented by the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1968, resulted in ROE of unprecedented detail and restrictiveness." Indeed, an [internal air force study](https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA597620/page/n1/mode/2up) prior concluded the same, "military barracks were prohibited. The suppression of SAMS and gun-laying radar systems was prohibited in this area as were attacks on NVN air bases from which attacking aircraft might be operating."

- Between 1942 and 1960, it has been charged that the United States influenced the Philippines via its "capitalistic elite," on US foreign policy. This hypothesis has been dispelled by a close and critical examination of US and Philippine government archives by world-leading historian, Nick Cullather in his monograph, 'Illusions of Influence The Political Economy of United States-Philippines Relations, 1942-1960.' "Based on extensive research in U.S. and Philippine archives, Cullather's study exposes the limits of American influence with its former colony. Its thesis, simply
stated, is that a succession of Philippine presidents consistently thwarted U.S. policy initiatives, particularly ones aimed at reforming the Philippine economy, because their agendas differed from those of U.S. administrations. Whereas American policy makers wanted to promote economic growth and to eliminate corruption in order to insure the stability of the new, strategically important nation-state, Philippine leaders aimed, above all, to reward domestic political allies with economic advantages and to promote the Philippine manufacturing sector, however inefficient, at the expense of Chinese and foreign competitors. Cullather explodes a number of myths in this book. He shows, for example, that the close economic ties established between the United States and the Philippines after 1946-including a preferential tariff system were not imposed on an unwilling Philippine government. In fact, Philippine leaders favored those ties, believing that the country's economic health depended on them. Furthermore, they were approved over the strong objections of the U.S. State Department, which opposed special bilateral arrangements. Cullather recounts, too, the largely successful efforts of the administrations of Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino to resist U.S. efforts to dictate policy. Perhaps his most arresting findings relate to Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, typically depicted as a creature of C.I.A. operative Edward Lansdale. But, as Cullather demonstrates, Magsaysay adeptly used his close U.S. connections to enlarge his patronage base and gave little attention to land and tax reform programs favored by the U.S. government because they threatened to undermine Magsaysay's alliances with planters, industrialists, and warlords. Even on regional security matters, Magsaysay was anything but a puppet, effectively resisting U.S. pressure to recognize South Vietnam and to grant additional land for military bases. Rather than being manipulated by Lansdale, Magsaysay was a master manipulator."<sup>[1](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/101/1/262/18599)</sup></sup> " This well-written and instructive book succeeds admirably in its objectives. First, it convincingly challenges conventional wisdom that Washington easily dominated postwar United States-Philippines relations. Second, it demonstrates that world systems analysis and dependency theory need to take into account more fully the nuances of a client-patron relationship. Third, it shows that when historians of diplomacy venture overseas to research foreign archives and to learn about foreign cultures, they may discover that American influence—so often portrayed as fact in United States documents—is in many ways illusory.<sup>[2](https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/82/3/1275/676232?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false)</sup></sup> 

- In 1951, the Dalai Lama pleaded with the international community publicly, and to the US secretly, to aid the Tibetan people against the illegal, genocidal imperialistic campaign of the Chinese communists in Tibet. As one of the leading historians on the CIA's aid to the Tibetan people notes, "our involvement was right for the times and the ideal we professed. The Tibetans never approached us as supplicants, but as fellow believers in similar democratic values who were temporary victims of a common enemy. They asked for the means to fight for their own cause, which they assumed was ours. Our willingness to respond to this appeal was noted by those other nations who were then judging our readiness to commit ourselves against our professions. It was an honorable operation."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/COVERT%20ACTION%20IN%20HIGH%20ALT%5B14688685%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20141013004630/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0005543224.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- In 1950, it was alleged that A US airstrike deliberately targeted South Korean refugees in the village of Nogeun-ri (No Gun Ri).
An [independent and authoritative investigation](https://web.archive.org/web/20051028235056/http://www.army.mil/nogunri/) summarised as follows:
"Over the last year, the Review Team has conducted an exhaustive factual review by examining over a million documents from the National Archives, conducting interviews with approximately 200 American witnesses, and analyzing the interview transcripts and oral statements of approximately 75 Korean witnesses.  The U.S. Review Team also closely examined press reports, aerial imagery, and other forensic examination results.  This U.S. Report reflects the U.S. Review Team’s factual findings based upon all the evidence available on the incident. During late July 1950, Korean civilians were caught between withdrawing U.S. forces and attacking enemy forces.  As a result of U.S. actions during the Korean War in the last week of July 1950, Korean civilians were killed and injured in the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  The Review Team did not find that the Korean deaths and injuries occurred exactly as described in the Korean account.  To appraise these events, it is necessary to recall the circumstances of the period.  U.S. forces on occupation duty in Japan, mostly without training for, or experience in, combat were suddenly ordered to join ROK forces in defending against a determined assault by well-armed and well-trained NKPA forces employing both conventional and guerilla warfare tactics.  The U.S. troops had to give up position after position.  In the week beginning July 25, 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division, withdrawing from Yongdong toward the Naktong River, passed through the vicinity of No Gun Ri.  Earlier, roads and trails in South Korea had been choked with civilians fleeing south.  Disguised NKPA soldiers had mingled with these refugees.  U.S. and ROK commanders had published a policy designed to limit the threat from NKPA infiltrators, to protect U.S. forces from attacks from the rear, and to prevent civilians from interfering with the flow of supplies and troops.  The ROK National Police were supposed to control and strictly limit the movements of innocent refugees. In these circumstances, especially given the fact that many of the U.S. soldiers lacked combat-experienced officers and Non-commissioned officers, some soldiers may have fired out of fear in response to a perceived enemy threat without considering the possibility that they might be firing on Korean civilians." 

- In 1950s, The Soviet Union, China and North Korea started propaganda that the US had used Biological weapons against civilians and combatants. This has been a long-debunked conspiracy theory.<sup>[1](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/leitenberg_biological_weapons_korea.pdf)</sup></sup> Tactics used by China and NK include the establishment of [fake Scientific panels, presenting fabricated evidence](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/collection/250/korean-war-biological-warfare-allegations).

A number of academic papers refute Soviet/Russian BW disinformation.<sup>[1](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2021-10/NonProliferationReview_False%20allegations%20of%20biological%20weapons%20use%20from%20Putin%20s%20Russia.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2021-10/NonProliferationReview%20Supplemental%20material_rnpr_a_1964755_sm5635.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1968, My Lai was substantiated by the [Peers investigation](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/RDAR-Vol-I.pdf). Those responsible were held to account. Since then, nothing like it has returned. However the list incorrectly states it was between 347-504 civilians killed. It was 175. Further, the US Military couldn't obtain further prosecutions because of Congressional testimony immunity. It should be noted as well that a US pilot prevented the incident from continuing and evacuated civilians.<sup>[1](https://capl.army.mil/case-studies/wcs-single.php?id=76&title=my-lai-at-50)</sup></sup>

- In 1967, the South Vietnamese government operated a program called Phung Hoang or Phoenix. CIA aided in it, but it was [not theirs](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000300130040-4.pdf). It has been alleged that it was an assassination/torture program—this is [not true](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R000800090012-8.pdf#page=5). Since independent actions against the CVI were deemed inefficient and ineffective, the Phung Hoang program was conceived to unite and coordinate a total government effort against the VCI. As such, Phung Hoand represented an intelligence coordination mechanism—in the form of coordinating committees at the province, regional and national level; and intelligence and operations coordinating centers at the province and district level—which aimed at a united total governmental effort against the CVI. It was _not_ a program of assassination or terror in response to Communist terror, and the program did not authorise torture, brutality or cruel methods in the interrogation or handling of captives. The US further worked with the Government to make sure [adequate, humane treatment as focal, observing fair concepts of due process and improve conditions of internment](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001100060018-1.pdf).

- 1955-1973. There were two phases of the US involvement in Laos. One was waged in the north to assure the independence, territorial integrity, and neutrality of the Laotian government, guaranteed by the 1954 and 1962 Geneva agreements. The other was waged in the south to arrest the infiltration of manpower and supplies from communist North Vietnam to the Viet Cong insurgents in non-communist South Vietnam, to which US forces were committed to minimizing civilian casualties via strict ROEs.

  The Geneva agreements of 1954, ending French control over Indochina, left the Kingdom of Laos a very fragile country, ruled by contesting factions. There were separate military groupings with the neutralists controlling the Royal Laotian Army (shortly renamed the Forces Armees du Royaume or FAR) and a Pathet Lao army occupying two northern provinces, Houa Phan, also called Samneua, and Phong Saly. The population of three million included a small, French-educated elite and numerous diverse, illiterate tribal groups who lived in isolated jungle and mountainous areas. The United States supported but did not sign the 1954 Geneva agreements. It nevertheless believed that the free world’s interest required keeping Laos and two other newly created Indochina states, South Vietnam and Cambodia, outside the orbit of Communist North Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union. The provisions applicable to Laos forbade the Vientiane government from entering into any foreign military alliance, called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops except a French military training mission, and limited the types and amount of military equipment that could be used by the small Royal Laotian Army of 10,000 men. Also established was an International Control Commission consisting of Indian, Canadian, and Polish representatives to ensure compliance with the provisions. Given Laos’s weaknesses, the impreciseness of some of the agreement’s provisions, and the suspicions in Washington of the intentions of Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow, enforcement of the agreements to assure Laos’s neutrality promised to be difficult. With few exceptions, the Pathet Lao barred the International Control Commission from entering its occupied areas (including several occasions firing on ICC helicopters), and Hanoi made no significant withdrawal of its North Vietnamese cadres engaged in training, equipping, and supporting their Pathet Lao allies.
  
  The pseudo-nationalist Communist insurgent group, the Pathet Lao, under the control of North Vietnam (in direct violation of the Geneva Accords), started an insurrection via a campaign of propaganda<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R000600080007-0.pdf)</sup></sup> and terrorism, to sway towards North Vietnam. Under SEATO, to which Laos was not party to, the United Stated provided non-military aid to the country to repel the Pathet Lao, in the form of the Program Evaluation Office (PEO), in compliance with the Geneva Agreement.<sup>[2](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB248/war_in_northern_laos.pdf)</sup></sup> In 1958, the CIA entered the scene: It begun two operations, one civic program to locally  encourage the government to focus on the welfare of rural populations and the working class and the other, focused on small, mobile units designed to operate in enemy-held territory, challenging Pathet Lao control and organizing civilian resistance.<sup>[3](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/6_UNDERCOVER_ARMIES.pdf)</sup></sup> In 1960 the US began reconnaissance flights to document Pathet Lao's violations.<sup>[4](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01720R001300050007-2.pdf)</sup></sup> These terminated in 1962 after a new Agreement was reached.
  
  Two crises drew the United States deeper into Laos’s internal affairs. The first occurred on April 10 when a rightist faction of the Government of National Union again attempted a coup to replace Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma. American officials acted quickly to restore things as they were. The second crisis derived from the first. Taking advantage of the political disarray in Vientiane, the Pathet Lao in mid-May stepped up military operations against neutralist Kong Le’s forces and shortly captured the Plain of Jars. In Washington, State and Defense officials now believed the upsurge in communist activity warranted an additional response. The Laos government had requested the recon missions to assist the International Control Commission in documenting Pathet Lao violations of the 1962 Geneva agreements. In Jun 1964, a US Navy reconnaissance aircraft was shot down, in response, President Johnson, with Prime Minister Souvanna’s approval, quickly ordered fighter escorts for the reconnaissance aircraft with pilots henceforth authorized to return enemy fire. Continued violations by Communist North Vietnam would further escalate the US response up until 1973 via bombing campaigns to target Viet Cong under strict ROE to limit civilian casualties<sup>[5](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/27/2001329814/-1/-1/0/AFD-100927-078.pdf)</sup></sup>  <sup>[6](https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/06/2001329752/-1/-1/0/AFD-101006-027.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[7](https://archive.org/details/cambodia-laos-review)</sup></sup>
  
  In the early 1970s, allegations of CIA's complicity in illegal drug trafficking in Laos (and the broader Golden Triangle). One such popular perpetrator of this lie was Alfred W. McCoy's 'The politics of heroin in Southeast Asia'. However, this book, and media claims of this were far from the facts of reality. CIA Headquarters and Stations in Asia actively pressured the resistance groups they aided from engaging in such activities, such as driving the Yao chieftain Chao out of the business; the Agency also made sure no US assets would be used for illegal smuggling. CIA's sensitivities to the illegal activity was so great, that one "acting chief of security once proposed a sting operation, with narcotics on an Air America plane going to Saigon used to lure traffickers there into a trap. Devlin imagined the press hysteria that would result if word got out about drugs moving on the CIA's airline, and he rejected the idea on the spot." Other details of CIA efforts to counter the narcotics smuggling can be found in the declassified study, 'Undercover Armies, CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos'

- It has been alleged that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a US false flag to justify the Vietnam war, and that it's admitted in the declassified record. This is a well-debunked myth. The list cites a wiki entry, which cites to a declassified NSA document as evidence. However, problems arise when one actually reads the document in question. 1) It's an opinion piece in NSA's Cryptologic Quarterly. 2) The author in the study actually cautions against a conspiracy theory take, "This mishandling of SIGINT was not done in a manner that can be construde as conspiratorial , that is, with manufactured evidence and collusion at all levels. Rather, the objective of these individuals was to support the Navy's claim that the Desoto patrol had been deliberately attacked by the North Vietnamese." It's worth noting as well, that the NSA, while appreciative of the study, [disagrees](https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/gulf-of-tonkin/articles/release-2/rel2_thoughts_intelligence.pdf) with the author's central premise: That SIGINT/COMINT was mishandled. According to the response, "This article does dispute Mr. Hanyok's assertion that SIGINT was mishandled, deliberately skewed or not provided to the Johnson administration. In fact, the record shows that NSA performed magnificently during this period of crisis, providing all SIGINT available in a timely manner to a broad spectrum of customers. With only a few trained Vietnamese linguists at NSA Headquarters and field stations analyzing encrypted North Vietnamese communications, NSA still provided U.S. forces advance warning of possible intended attacks that quite likely prevented the sinking of a U.S. destroyer on 2 August.

  Further evidence refuting the claim that COMINT information was presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964 can be found in the NSA review of Secretary McNamara's testimony before Congress. NSA noted that McNamara systematically used overkill language with COMINT and that the COMINT surrounding Tonkin was "flexible for interpretation". Again in 1972, as noted by Mr. Hanyok, NSA Deputy Director Dr. Tordella provided Senator Fulbright's staff director Carl Marcy access to all NSA material relating to the Gulf of Tonkin and told Mr. Marcy that the intercept of 4 August could indeed refer to events that occurred on 2 August.
  
  These facts make it clear that NSA consistently provided the Administration, as well as Congress, all COMINT information related to the events of 2-4 August. In fact, one NSA manager present during the August 1964 events has stated, "the folks downtown were provided all of the COM INT as they wanted to do their own analysis. They weren't overly interested in what we thought." Some would argue that NSA should have explicitly informed decision makers in formal SIGINT reporting that COMINT showed there was no attack on 4 August. However, the available COMINT could not support such a position. While some analysts did indeed come to such a conclusion, the COMINT itself, as noted by Dr. Tordella, was "flexible for interpretation".

  In the final analysis, it is clear that not only was SIGINT information _not_ presented in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events of 4 August 1964, but that all of the COM INT produced was distributed to CIA, JCS, DIA and other customers and that NSA uncertainties, even of single words, were made known to decision makers."
  
- In the summer of 1950 in South Korea, South Korea engaged in a massacre. British and US Governments tried to prevent it, and managed to save a large number of civilians. United States official documents show that John J. Muccio, then United States Ambassador to South Korea, made recommendations to South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo that the executions be stopped. Great Britain raised this issue with the U.S. at a diplomatic level, causing Dean Rusk, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, to inform the British that U.S. commanders were doing "everything they can to curb such atrocities".[8] During the massacre, the British protected their allies and saved some citizens.

- The US involvement in Vietnam is one of nuance and slow buildup. In 1955, the US reached a formal advisory role to South Vietnam. In 1959, two US Military advisors were killed in a terror attack at Bien Hoa. The advisory role and eventual military training assistance by 1961, were all brought about by the increased North Vietnam attacks of aggression. Indeed, the first POW of the war, George Fryett, was kidnapped for the crime of riding his bicycle on the outskirts of Saigon. By 1962, due to the ongoing attacks by the North communist regime—in direct violation of both international law, the SEATO Treaty and the Geneva Accords of 1954—South Vietnam asks the United States for assistance in self-defense, which leads to an increase in US assistance. The full conflict begins in 1964. So begins the military operations until 1975.<sup>[1](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Military-Assistance-Advisory-Group-Indochina-is-Re-Designated-MAAG-Vietnam/)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Two-U-S-Military-Advisers-Are-Killed-At-Bien-Hoa/)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/Civilian-Irregular-Defense-Groups-Formally-Established/)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.vietnamwar50th.com/1945-1964_the_road_to_war/First-U-S-POW-In-Vietnam/)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://dsc.duq.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1330&context=dlr)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400885909-017/html?lang=en) </sup></sup> <sup>[7](https://www.jstor.org/stable/794921?origin=crossref)</sup></sup> <sup>[8](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-legal-materials/article/abs/legal-memorandum-on-us-action-in-vietnam/756631751CE81CBF218B31528720DB82)</sup></sup> <sup>[9](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/abs/lawfulness-of-military-assistance-to-the-republic-of-vietnam/CE962350F9CC548F3D5E64F179B2EAD6)</sup></sup>

- From 1949 into 1954, CIA covertly supported anticommunist, democratic movements made up of students and refugees in their propaganda operations in mainland China, known as the "Third Force". They also supported a paramilitary arm, focused at resisting Soviet/Communist authoritarian military aggression against Korea.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/static/58b7c48bd76884f38902a2891a5a3cea/Covert-Action-in-China.pdf)</sup></sup>

- From 1946-55, the Huk Rebellion in the Philippines. The list cites the one-sided wiki article to suggest that the rebellion (consisting of peasants and farmers), were brutally oppressed by the US/Filipino Government. The wiki, and the list, rely heavily on the book, 'The Huk Rebellion: A Case Study of Peasant Revolt in the Philippines'. However, upon reading this reference, a few things become apparent, that the rebellion subsided due to various reason:
  1. agrarian reforms were instituted by the Government.
  2. Army minimised its abuses. Improving on its adherence to the rule of law.
  3. The Communist party joining the rebellion, urging for more radical changes than what the peasants  espoused. The wide gap between the Communist leaders and the peasants was never bridged, thus weakening the movement.

  Indeed, the author credits well-documented US efforts to shape this reform, working with the Filipino Government.
 As noted in a critically-acclaimed history, 'The Hukbalahap Insurrection: A case study of a successful anti-insurgency Operation in the Philippines - 1946–1955', "Graft and corruption ran rampant in government. The Roxas
administration seemed to condone it and did nothing to conceal its presence or depth. In a 1948 letter to General Omar Bradley, the Chief of Staff, Major General George F. Moore (Commander, U.S. Army Philippine-Ryukyus Command) reported that Philippine law enforcement and court systems were inadequate, applied arbitrarily, and did not protect the citizen. Rather. he reported they were being used as tools by government officials, wealthy landowners, and businessmen." Magsaysay became a key figure in cleaning house when he took the position of secretary: Removing corruption within the military and providing justice reform across the board. This only became more pronounced when he became President.

  "A prominent factor in the successful anti-guerrilla campaign was the close, personal relationship that developed between Edward Lansdale and Ramon Magsaysay . This relationship provided an effective conduit through which American advice affected Philippine actions during this period. To overlook Lansdale's role would be to neglect a significant chapter of this story. Lansdale was given exceptional freedom of action and quickly became Hegsaysey's de facto personal advisor. Often the two talked long into the night about conditions that fostered the insurrection and about the real need for governmental and social reforms. Shortly thereafter. Magsaysay took steps to revitalize the military, improve pay and morale, eliminate corrupt officers, and foster his campaign to win the people back to the central government.  The people saw clear evidence of military professionalism, competence, and honesty (quite a dramatic change) and through the military's behavior. began to realize that Magsaysay was working for their benefit. To what did Edward Lansdale credit his success? First and foremost, he dealt with Magsaysay and the Filipinos as friends and equals. Filipinos viewed friendship as a deeper and longer-lived relationship than Americans did. To them, friendship involved total acceptance into their their most valued social institution—the family. Trusting the Filipinos, allowing them to form their own solutions to their problems with a minimum of interference, and always treating them as equals were Lansdale's keys to success. He advised them on counter-guerrilla tactics and helped them lessen their reliance on conventional operations, but he always made sure they were responsible for the decisions. He maintained a low-profile and allowed Filipinos to take credit for successful operations, concurrently building pride and confidence in the AFP and their fellow countrymen. As retired Maj. Gen.

During the interrogations for war crimes prosecutions, the members gave up information to the US, however, [no evidence](https://networks.h-net.org/node/20904/reviews/21143/fouraker-harris-factories-death-japanese-biological-warfare-1932-1945) indicates that MacArthur pardoned anyone.

- US Fire bombings in Germany and Japan, as well as the use of nuclear weapons fell well within international law at the time As one of the world's leading experts [notes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2924907), "President Truman’s classification of the bombing as a purely military objective has caused  some  historians to speculate that the President  engaged in “self-deception.”4  Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate. Although Hiroshima was not a military  base as understood today, it was  a “military city”  as it housed the 2d Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan.5 The city was also a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops...  Nagasaki’s  military  industry  made it significant. The  atomic  bomb  landed between  the two principal targets in the city:  the Mitsubishi Steel and Arm Works and  the  Mitsubishi-Uramaki  Ordnance  Works (Torpedo  Works).
 The atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were lawful under the laws of war existing in 1945. These attacks also represent the only two instances  of  atomic  weapon  strikes in  history. They illustrate the definitional confusion existing with respect  to  the  U.S. classification  of lawful military  objects exclusive of civilian  objects. If some  historians  believe President Truman  was  engaged in “self-deception” in labelling Hiroshima a military target, those historians may be equally perplexed by modern American usage of law-of-war target labels. Under the mid-twentieth century military’s targeting lexicon, however, the President’s understanding of Hiroshima as a military target was accurate."<sup>[1](https://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/3567438/Bennett.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.raf.mod.uk/what-we-do/centre-for-air-and-space-power-studies/documents1/air-power-review-vol-13-no-3/)</sup></sup>
 
- Between October/November 1901, during the Philippine–American War in the battle of Samar (Battle of Balangiga), General Jacob H. Smith is famously quoted as ordering, “I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill and burn the better you will please me... The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness.” When asked by Major Waller asked about the age of those to whom he should apply this guidance, Smith replied that males over ten years old should be considered as being capable of bearing arms. This is cited as evidence that Smith ordered unlawful killings and atrocities against the villagers. This narrative, however, ignores some key facts: When court-martialed for their actions on Samar. Waller would testify that rather than taking the order literally, his interpretation of Smith’s intemperate guidance was, “that the General wanted all insurrectionists killed... people who were bearing arms against Americans... I understood that we were not to  take prisoners if they were armed.” In fact, Waller testified that he cautioned his officers that “we were not sent here to make war on women and children and old men." While smith was seen as ruthless and excessively forceful, "... a circular he issued on 18 November 1901 specifically sought to ensure that accommodating natives were cared for: “Emphasis is laid upon the point that the brigade commander desires not only to permit proper food supplies to reach all friendly natives,  but he particularly desires that these supplies do so reach them." Besides this, Smith was "not tried for issuing illegal orders or for inciting war crimes. Instead, he was charged with 'conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline' for the excessive nature of his orders. A military court headed by Maj. Gen. Loyd Wheaton, who had commanded the Department of North Philippines, that convened in Manila in April 1902 found General Smith guilty of instructing  Waller to “kill and burn” as  much as possible and not take any prisoners. Commenting on this verdict three months later, Secretary of War Elihu Root described the  language Smith was convicted of using as containing “intemperate, inconsiderate, and violent expressions, which, if accepted literally, would grossly violate the humane rules governing American armies in the field.” But the court exercised leniency and sentenced Smith merely to be 'admonished by the reviewing authority.' It  justified this outcome by concluding that Smith “did not mean everything that his unexplained language implied; that his subordinates did not gather such a meaning;  and that the orders were never executed in such sense.” Root commented, “Fortunately they [Smith’s instructions] were not taken literally and were not followed. No  women or children or helpless persons or noncombatants or prisoners were put to death in pursuance of them." Smith was still forced out of the Military for his actions. Others were also convicted and served life in prison for unlawful acts unrelated to Smith.<sup>[1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26296824?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents)</sup></sup>

## USA/Domestic matters
- On Feb 10, 2022, Senator Wyden once again made headlines with his lies distorting details of a CIA program during his reelection run. He alleged, per a letter that was approved for declassification that he wrote, that the CIA operates a program that collects, in bulk, US Person data, akin to the discontinued BMD program 215 of the PA. It should be noted that declassification isn't an accuracy review, nor endorse the content. With the letter, the CIA also declassified a PCLOB report on the program, though heavily redacted. However, Senator Wyden counted on the media not reading this document, as it makes clear: 1) The program targeted financial records belonging to ISIS: " This report examines the CIA’s financial data activities conducted under E.O. 12333 in support of counterterrorism efforts with respect to the network of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL." 2) That the program didn't intentionally collect USP data, that unintentional collection must be avoided as much as possible: "officials also emphasized that targeters try to limit the amount of information about USPs that is collected. [redacted] examples of such limits focus on avoiding information that is clearly identifiable as US-focused. For example, [redacted] stated that CIA operators would try to avoid collection information [redacted] believed to have a connection to the US. Similarly, [redacted] CIA operators would try to avoid [redacted] asserts that it follows routine steps to limit USP data." 3) CIA has an effective means to mask and delete USP data: "The CIA OIG reviewed the filters used [redacted] and related procedures and concluded that they are 'effective in identifying USP information in bulk financial data'... OIG described a separate process by which the CIA’s [redacted] takes steps to “minimize,” i.e., delete, segregate, or mask USP information in certain collections before the data is transferred... OIG conclude that the procedures “were effective in ensuring that only minimized bulk financial data are disseminated." The Senator also lied about not being briefed. His committee was, as unclassified documents confirm.<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/static/63f697addbbd30a4d64432ff28bbc6d6/OPCL-PCLOB-Report-on-CIA-Activities.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2016, activists and media pundits decried the building of the Dakota Access pipeline, that crosses 4 states. Myths and disinformation ran wild, so here are the [facts](https://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/The-Facts.html):
   - The Dakota Access pipeline is not built on Native American reservations. 99.98% of the pipeline is installed on privately owned property in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. The Dakota Access Pipeline does not enter the Standing Rock Sioux reservation at any point.
   - Eight other pipelines currently run below Lake Oahe. In fact, existing pipelines have safely transported natural gas beneath Lake Oahe for more than 30 years.
   - The Dakota Access Pipeline was approved by regulatory agencies in all four states where the pipeline will operate and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   - Tribes were consulted hundreds of times while DAPL route was planned. In developing the route, the United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was reviewed. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the Dakota.
   - The Dakota Access Pipeline has not impacted groundwater in any of the four states through which it passes since going into service in June of 2017.
   - The Dakota Access Pipeline does not encroach on water supply; the Standing Rock Sioux's water intake has been moved to a location about 75 miles away from the pipeline.
   - The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation, also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes and located in North Dakota, use the Dakota Access Pipeline to transport more than 60% of the oil they produce.
   - In August of 2018, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed more than a year of additional study of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, saying the work substantiated its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats.
   - Were tribes consulted on the Dakota Access Pipeline? Yes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers had hundreds of contacts with dozens of tribes while the Dakota Access project was under review. In addition, the U.S. Army Corps reached out to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe nearly a dozen times to discuss archaeological and other surveys conducted before finalizing the pipeline route. During the planning phase, Dakota Access worked with the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer and contracted professionally licensed archaeologists to conduct Class II and Class III cultural surveys. Indeed, as a Court [found](https://mwalliancenow.org/news/memorandum-opinion-judge-standing-rock-sioux-tribe-v-us-army-corps-engineers/), "In fact, on this record, it appears that the Corps exceeded its NHPA obligations at many of the PCN sites."
   - The protests cost the state of North Dakota a lot of resources and money. According to local law enforcement, protesters provoked multiple dangerous and criminal confrontations and caused significant damage to property. Additional police were brought in from all over the country to help during the protests. North Dakota's congressional delegation has asked the federal government for $38 million to cover the cost of policing the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Approximately 21 million pounds of trash, debris and waste was ultimately removed from the protest site at Lake Oahe, costing over $1 million in clean up and causing significant concern for the health of the lake. Corps Capt. Ryan Hignight said a total of 8,170 cubic yards of debris was removed from the three camps - Sacred Stone, Oceti Sakowin and Rosebud - all within the flood plain on federally managed land. In 2017, Energy Transfer gifted the state of North Dakota $15 million to help cover costs.

- The Curtis Culwell Center attack was a failed terrorist attack on an exhibit featuring cartoon images of Muhammad at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015. Political pundits have claimed that undercover FBI agent encouraged Elton Simpson to commit the attacks. However, as in all cases of this nature, the FBI didn't initiate the plans or desire. Indeed, Simpson et al had evidence of terrorism links dating back to the mid 2000s. Conspiracy theorists try to quote-mine the text, "tear up Texas" as evidence of FBI "goading". However, in context, Simpson was already of this mindset by stating, "that goes without saying." The Courts have ruled, that FBI's activities here were proper, abiding by the Constitution, laws, and various governing regulations. <sup>[1](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.293751/gov.uscourts.txnd.293751.28.0_1.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2015, it was alleged by Senate Democrats that the CIA spied on their staffers during the SSCI's study of the RDI program.

This allegation at first appeared to be supported by an independent CIA IG investigation—however, the IG investigation was refuted by a secondary [review](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1502797/redacted-12-2014-agency-accountability-board.pdf) by an Accountability Review Board, to which DOJ agreed. There was no spying. It was CIA's servers (known as RDInet), on a CIA facility, accessing CIA records, to which the Senate Staffers were aware CIA was able to access the other side to make sure no documents were present that shouldn't have been there. This was routine. The allegation, and broader CIA interaction with the Committee was fictionalised in the movie, 'the report',  which has been thoroughly discredited.<sup>[1](https://www.lawfareblog.com/portrayal-cia-report-separating-truth-fiction)</sup></sup>

- In 2015, conspiracy theorists claim that the Chicago Homan Square facility is a "domestic blacksite". This, of course, is nonsense. It never was a secret facility, and people detained their for various crimes can be seen by their own lawyers, or issued a government lawyer, a long established practice the free, Western world. Homan Square is home to CPD’s Evidence and Recovered Property Section, which is open to the public. Homan Square is the only CPD facility where members of the public can collect evidence recovered during a now complete criminal investigation, or found property. Portions of the facility are sensitive. Homan Square is the base of operations for officers working undercover assignments. These men and women dress in plain clothes and work to disrupt gang activity and clear drug markets out of neighborhoods. Advertising their base of operations could put their lives at risk, which is why Homan Square features little signage. Other sensitive units housed at the facility include the Bureau of Organized Crime (including the narcotics unit), the SWAT Unit, Evidence Technicians, and the CPD ballistics lab. Fake allegations claim there is police beatings, and room-controlled temp to force admissions, however, there is no such thing at the facility. Everything about the facility is standard in terms of procedure.<sup>[1](https://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/Homan-Fact-Sheet.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2014, media headlines claimed a paper proved that the US was an oligarchy. Several papers have critiqued this paper based on deeply flawed methodology. The consensus in literature disregard the claim.<sup>[1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/relative-policy-support-and-coincidental-representation/BBBD524FFD16C482DCC1E86AD8A58C5B)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/polq.12577)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168015608896)</sup></sup>

- Disgraced journalist, Sharyl Attkisson, claimed in 2013 that the Obama administration was spying on her, due to her reporting on Fast and Furious and Benghazi. She hired a technician to review her computer, who conclude there was an advanced actor who gained remote access. However, an independent, expert forensic examination revealed serious flaws in their work. Ultimately concluded no such action occurred. Further exposing this hoax, the FBI confirmed that Attkisson was not subject to any FBI investigation.<sup>[1](https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/SharylAttkissonIGreport.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2013, a Federal Appeals Court upheld the conviction on James Cromitie, a man who desired to strike terror on American soil. He claimed his convictions were invalid because he was entrapped by the FBI and that the FBI engaged in outrageous conduct. However, the 2013 ruling determined neither to have been the case. James was the first to raise the idea of bombing synagogues. "as with all sting operations, government creation of the opportunity to commit an offense, even to the point of supplying defendants with materials essential to commit crimes, does not exceed due process limits. Once the FBI learned that Cromitie, in his very first encounter with Hussain, had expressed a desire to 'do something to America' and had given an ominous meaning to this statement by saying he wanted to die like a martyr, the FBI agents would have been derelict in their duties if they did not test how far Cromitie would go to carry out his desires. Determining whether Cromitie would go so far as to launch missiles at military aircraft was not outrageous government conduct."<sup>[1](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-cromitie)</sup></sup>

- Conservatives, since 2013 have repeated the lie that right-wing organisations were unfairly targeted by the IRS, under Obama's order. However, two inspector general reports found that: Some analysts did target political groups, however, across the political spectrum; it wasn't a deliberate political move; once supervisors learned of the issue, it was remedied and the administration had nothing to do with the rare, honest mistake. FBI and DOJ also reviewed all the evidence, under both Obama and Trump admins, finding 0 laws broken and 0 criminal intent.<sup>[1](https://republicans-waysandmeansforms.house.gov/uploadedfiles/09.08.17_doj_response_to_criminal_referral_request.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2017reports/201710054fr.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.newsweek.com/remember-irs-scandal-it-was-fake-news-all-along-681674)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists claim that under the 2012 NDAA, US citizens can be indefinitely detained by the Military, for no reason. However, reading the 2012 NDAA, we find this isn't so. All it did was codify the 2001 AUMF. It should be noted that NDAAs change, but come around every year. Further, not a single example exists to show this has been misused.

- In 2012, sensationalist reporting from the WSJ claimed that the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), as a result of changes in March of that year to AG guidelines, allowed NCTC access to data from other agencies, on any and all Americans, for no reason. The headlines that followed, as well as the original WSJ piece, distort reality—either by gross incompetence or a deliberate. The 2008 Guidelines established three “tracks” for NCTC to access or acquire such information from other federal agencies. Under Track 1, NCTC analysts would have account-based access to a relevant agency dataset, while under Track 2, NCTC would submit query terms for the providing agency to perform the search and return responsive information. Under Track 3, the agency dataset would be replicated (copied) at NCTC so NCTC could use its analytic tools to identify terrorism information; if NCTC could not “promptly” identify terrorism information in the replicated dataset, the 2008 Guidelines required NCTC to “promptly remove” the information. As implemented at NCTC, this generally required the removal of information within 180 days.

  In March, 2012, the DNI, the Attorney General, and the Director of NCTC approved the updated NCTC Guidelines. The Guidelines now provide that datasets likely to contain significant terrorism information may be temporarily retained for up to 5 years (or a shorter period as determined with the providing agency, known as the "data provider"). The updated Guidelines carry forward the same three-track framework from the 2008 Guidelines, while adding specificity on how data is obtained, retained, and disseminated, and providing for enhanced safeguards and oversight mechanisms to protect important privacy and civil liberties interests throughout the information sharing lifecycle. These 3 tracks only relate to the following 3 types of data already in the lawful and Constitutional possession of the Government: International travel, immigration status records and financial related, where banks may submit what they believe to be suspect financial transactions. 
  
  The Guidelines only apply to datasets that are reasonably believed to contain terrorism information. Moreover, NCTC may only retain United States person information (and other information protected under the Guidelines) within such datasets beyond the temporary retention period if it is reasonably believed to constitute terrorism information. 
  
  For Tracks 1 and 2, NCTC’s initial query term must itself be an item of terrorism information. For Track 3, NCTC’s queries must be designed solely to identify terrorism information and to minimize the review of information protected under the Guidelines that is not terrorism information. In addition, NCTC must limit access to duly trained and authorized personnel, implement compliance verification measures, and determine whether to apply enhanced safeguards (e.g., more data access/use restrictions). For all tracks, information protected under the Guidelines may be shared only under limited circumstances. Independent audits have confirmed NCTC abides by these restrictions.<sup>[1](https://sgp.fas.org/othergov/intel/nctc_guidelines.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/NCTC_White_Paper-Overview_of_NCTC_Data_Accesses_under_its_2012_AG_Guidelines_as_of_March_2014.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/NCTCWhitePaperOverviewofNCTC2012AGGBaselineSafeguards050114.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/CLPO_Information_Paper_on_NCTC_AG_Guidelines012213.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/news_documents/TAB_3_2013-2015_NCTC_AGG_Annual_Report_Redacted.pdf)</sup></sup>

In many cases, the panel sensed that officers had the authority they needed but were erring on the side of caution—a subtle form of risk aversion... these tendencies had practical and worrisome consequences in the two cases we studied." and, "Throughout our interviews, we were impressed with the great care taken by the Community to protect information about US Persons.... Intelligence officers in both the 25 December and the Hasan cases worked hard to stay within the  guidelines, which sometimes led to excessive caution."

- In an April 2008 a NYT article it was alleged that the DoD used retired military analyst (RMAs) to generate favorable news coverage of the administration’s wartime performance, and that it gave those analysts who had ties to military contractors an unfair opportunity to enhance their business interests. Two investigations were launched in repose to this article, plus a GAO opinion. The GAO opinion finds, "We found no evidence that DOD attempted to conceal from the public its outreach to RMOs or its role in providing RMOs with information, materials, access to department officials, travel, and luncheons. Moreover, we found no evidence that DOD contracted with or paid RMOs for positive commentary or analysis. Consequently, DOD’s public affairs activities involving RMOs, in our opinion, did not violate the publicity or propaganda prohibition."<sup>[1](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-316443.pdf)</sup></sup> Of the two IG investigations, the first concluded, "we found the evidence insufficient to conclude that RMA outreach activities were improper. Further, we found insufficient basis to conclude that OASD(PA) conceived of or undertook a disciplined effort to assemble a contingent of influential RMAs who could be depended on to comment favorably on DoD programs. With regard to RMAs who had ties to military contractors, extensive searches found no instance where such RMAs used information or contacts obtained as a result of the OASD(PA) outreach program to achieve a competitive advantage for their company. Of the 70 RMAs that we examined, we found that 20 (29 percent) had some type of corporate association. We examined publicly available contracting information involving RMA-affiliated companies to identify any pattern of contract award or contract type that might indicate an irregularity. We did not isolate such a pattern and concluded that further investigative work into this matter was not warranted."<sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20090320221936/http://www.dodig.osd.mil/Inspections/IE/Reports/ExaminationofAllegationsInvolvingDoDOfficeofPublicAffairsOutreachProgram.pdf)</sup></sup>

  The second report found, "The RMA outreach activities were consistent with DOD directives and regulations outlined for the community relations program and the implementation of those activities was not inconsistent with law or regulation. We found the intent of the RMA outreach activities was to provide information to the public through former military members, as credible third party subject matter experts. In implementing the RMA outreach activities, we found that OASD (PA) included a reasonable cross section of media outlets based on our analysis of the in-Pentagon meetings and the travel event."<sup>[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20120605001943/http://www.dodig.mil/Ir/reports/RMATheFinalReport112111redacted.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists have been claiming that between 2007 and 2008, there was misconduct, or corruption by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO), in the handling of the Federal investigation into Geffrey Epstein, by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement (NPA). This has become known as the "sweetheart deal." However, a thorough review by DOJ's OPR found no such corruption or misuse. During the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein's attorney, and filed under seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein attorney Lefkowitz and Villafaña (and others with Acosta and Sloman during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized, and thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkowitz's side of the communications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafaña's communications to Lefkowitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over Epstein's objections. Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafaña's emails as proof that Villafaña and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein's attorneys to keep the “sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in particular were cited as evidence of the USAO's  improper favouritism towards Epstein. OPR noted, "Because the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other information showing Villafaña’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a public narrative developed that Villafaña colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that narrative to be inaccurate."<sup>[1](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/justice-department-review-jeffrey-epstein/41c1a927e0acff76/full.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 2008, David Murfee Faulk and Adrienne Kinne made several allegations to the ABC that the NSA listens on to anyone's domestic calls. This allegation was independently investigated by 3 seperate watchdogs that found no merit to the claims, and that indeed, they had 0 access to many SIGINT systems.<sup>[1](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1350188-2009-oig-report)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Other/Intelligence_Oversight_Board_Office_of_the_Director_of_National_Intelligence%20_pages_1_to_93.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Conspiracy theorists distort what Operation Fast and Furious was, claiming, without evidence, that the US Government was secretly smuggling guns to cartels, or drugs, to Mexico. This however, is just fake news. Op Fast and Furious was an investigation. Nothing more. The background:
  On October 31, 2009, special agents working in the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) received information from a local gun store about the recent purchases of multiple AK- 47 style rifles by four individuals. Agents began investigating the purchases and soon came to believe that the men were so-called “straw purchasers” involved in a large-scale gun trafficking organization responsible for buying guns for transport to violent Mexican drug trafficking organizations. This investigation was later named “Operation Fast and Furious.” By the time ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona (U.S. Attorney’s Office) publicly announced the indictment in the case on January 25, 2011, agents had identified more than 40 subjects believed to be connected to a trafficking conspiracy responsible for purchasing over 2,000 firearms for approximately $1.5 million in cash. During the course of the investigation, ATF agents seized only about 100 of the firearms purchased, the result of a strategy jointly pursued by ATF and the U.S. Attorney’s Office that deferred taking overt enforcement action against the individual straw purchasers while seeking to build a case against the leaders of the organization. Numerous firearms bought by straw purchasers were later recovered by law enforcement officials at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States. One such recovery occurred in connection with the tragic shooting death of a federal law enforcement agent, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry. On January 16, 2010, one of the straw purchasers, Jaime Avila, purchased three AK-47 style rifles from a Phoenix-area gun store. ATF agents learned about that purchase 3 days later and, consistent with the investigative strategy in the case, made no effort to locate Avila or seize the rifles although ATF had identified Avila as a suspect in November 2009. Two of the three rifles purchased by Avila on January 16 were recovered 11 months later at the scene of the murder of Agent Terry, who was shot and killed on December 14, 2010, as he tried to arrest persons believed to be illegally entering the United States. The day after and in response to Agent Terry’s murder, ATF agents arrested Avila. Several weeks later, on January 19, 2011, the U.S. Attorney’s Office indicted 20 Operation Fast and Furious straw purchasers and gun traffickers. As of August 1, 2012, 14 defendants, including Avila, have entered guilty pleas to one or more counts of the indictment. Although the FBI was assigned to investigate the murder of Agent Terry, the senior leadership of ATF and the Department of Justice (Department or DOJ) took little action in the immediate aftermath of Agent Terry’s death to learn more about an ATF investigation that involved the trafficking of approximately 2,000 weapons over many months, and how guns purchased by a previously-identified subject of that investigation ended up being recovered at the scene of Agent Terry’s murder. Shortly after Agent Terry’s death, stories began appearing on the Internet alleging that ATF had allowed firearms to “walk” to Mexico, and that one of those firearms may have been linked to the death of a federal law enforcement officer.<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/441887/ig-report-fast-and-furious.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
  Project Gunrunner also wasn't a secret gun-smuggling operation. Indeed, it combatted them.<sup>[2](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/ATF/e1101.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- Allegations arose that since 2001, the FBI had been targeting certain domestic advocacy groups such as PETA, Greenpeace, etc. However, an investigation  that examined a 6-year period from Jan 2001 to Dec 2006, found, "the evidence in our review did not indicate that the FBI targeted any of the groups for investigation based on their First Amendment activities."<sup>[1](https://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/oig-reports/s1009r.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- Political pundits and sensationalist headlines claimed in 2005, that the Pentagon was spying on Americans for anti-war demonstrations and groups. This sparked two members of Congress to request an independent IG investigation into the matter. This allegations concerns a database called Threat And Local Observation Notice (TALON). TALON was created under the DoD's Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA). The IG investigation however, found that this wasn't any sort of intelligence program. It found that TALON was a reporting system for community tips provided to DoD and law enforcement, on possible threats to DoD facilities. This enabled Commanders to protect their personnel and facilities. Further, "CIFA did not use the information in an attempt to monitor First Amendment activities of U.S. persons."<sup>[1](https://media.defense.gov/2007/Jun/27/2001712179/-1/-1/1/07-INTEL-09.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/TALON/20090626_dod_talon_release.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- A conspiracy theorist freelance journalist claimed, in 2005, that the US Government experimented on foster children with HIV and "poisoned" them, resulting in deaths of 25 kids. It was also claimed that they were selected based on race, among many other allegations. However, a study commissioned by New York found none of these claims was true.<sup>[1](https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/Experiences_of_NYC_Foster_Children_in_HIV-AIDS_Clinical_Trial_no_appendices.pdf)</sup></sup>  
  
- Political pundits claim that the Patriot Act was used to wrongfully target and arrest Brandon Mayfield, in May, 2004, in connection to the terrorist attack in Madrid—allegedly because he was a Muslim, that he was racially profiled. However, the independent DOJ Inspector General investigation found that 1. No Patriot Act authority was used, 2. The unique circumstances of Brandon Mayfield's fingerprints closely match those of the bomber, 3. Investigators did not know of his religion until during the investigation. 

  In sum, the OIG concluded "contrary to some public speculation, the Patriot Act amendments to FISA did not affect the government's decision to seek FISA authority in the Mayfield case and did not affect the scope of information the government collected about Mayfield pursuant to the FISA surveillance and searches. We also found that the FBI did not use certain provisions of the Patriot Act in the Mayfield case, such as those relating to delayed notification searches. Moreover, the evidence indicated that, even prior to the Patriot Act, the FBI would likely have sought and been able to obtain identical FISA authorization for the searches and surveillance of Mayfield that it conducted." 

  "The OIG concluded that Mayfield's religion was not the sole or primary cause of the FBI's failure to question the original misidentification and catch its error. The primary factors Were the similarity of the prints and the Laboratory's overconfidence in the superiority of its examiners."<sup>[1](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/archive/special/s0601/final.pdf)</sup></sup>
  
- For a number of years, conspiracy theorists have alleged that the DoD hired the Rendon Group to "deliberately create conditions that would convince the American people and Congress that Iraq was an imminent threat." However, a Congressionally-directed investigation revealed this allegation as totally unfounded. It further confirmed that Rendon group played no influence role in the Vieques vote in Puerto Rico.<sup>[1](https://media.defense.gov/2007/Mar/06/2001713007/-1/-1/1/07-INTEL-06.pdf)</sup></sup>  
  
- On October 2003, the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) was created, to consolidate and streamline terrorist watchlisting. A leaked document confirms that by design and intention, the Terrorists Screening Database (TSDB) conformed to the Constitution of the United States, that being: People were not nominated for watchlisting due to Constitutional protected activities. Free speech; exercise of religion; freedom of the press; freedom of peaceful assembly; petition the Government for redress of grievances and equal protection all applied to US persons in the US and abroad, and non-US persons in the US.<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1233708/2013-watchlist-guidance.pdf)</sup></sup> Several US Federal Appeals Courts have also confirmed that the TSDB falls within compliance to the Constitution.<sup>[2](https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/201119.P.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://casetext.com/case/beydoun-v-sessions-1)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://casetext.com/case/abdi-v-wray-1)</sup></sup>

- On May 6, 2002, the US opposed the ICC because it suffers from a number structural flaws, not because it wanted to "escape accountability." At the same time, the US proposed alternatives that already exist: 

  "Domestic Accountability: Encourage states to create credible justice institutions in their own state rather than abdicating responsibility to an international body. Where domestic legal institutions are lacking, but domestic will is present, the international community must be prepared to assist in creating the capacity for the sovereign state to address the violations. This includes political, financial, legal, and logistical support.
Where domestic will is non-existent, the international community can intervene through the UN Security Council, consistent with the UN Charter. Ad hoc international mechanisms may be created under the auspices of the UN Security Council, as was done to establish the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Additionally, hybrid courts consisting of international participants and the affected state’s participants can be authorized, such as in the case of Sierra Leone."<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20031129170524/http://www.usembassy.at/en/download/pdf/icc_pa.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Within the first 100 days of the tragic attack on 9/11, President Bush moved swiftly to protect Muslims from hate crimes and the Department of Justice followed his lead by having their Civil Rights Division sponsor community forums in Chicago, Illinois, and Dearborn, Michigan, on combating ethnically motivated violence as a result of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Attorney General John Ashcroft and AAG for Civil Rights Ralph F. Boyd, Jr. have met with 29 prominent leaders from the Arab and Muslim American and Sikh communities and underscored DOJ’s strong commitment to investigate and prosecute violators of federal hate crime laws.

  The Department of Justice, the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor issued a joint statement against employment discrimination in the aftermath of September 11. Investigating approximately 300 incidents involving violence, or threats of violence against individuals perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin. Federal charges have been brought in 6 cases, coordinating with local prosecutors in at least ten instances where cases are being prosecuted locally.<sup>[1](https://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/rls/wh/6947.htm)</sup></sup>
  
- Immediately after 9/11, indeed, within 3 months, law enforcement arrested people connected to the PENTTBOM investigation. In total, 762 aliens were under their violation of Immigration laws. During this time, they were manually reviewed by the FBI and released. While intended to be no more than a few days detained, the average was 80 days. The highest arrests were within the same week of the terror attacks. By December 2001, there was a sharp decline of arrests. Further, the vast majority of detainees held were treated like any other case. However, a few were roughly treated at NY's Brooklyn Metro Detention Center, by a handful of officers. MDC management installed cameras into teach 9/11 detainee's cell, and record all interactions between cells, to make sure they were not abused—or capture evidence if it did occur. <sup>[1](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/special/0306/full.pdf)</sup></sup>   
  
- Naturally, after 9/11, various States across the country requested requests for Intelligence Community support for counterterrorism investigations. A 2011 AP article alleged improper CIA activities involving NYPD. However, an independent investigation that reviewed thousands of records, many personnel, Congressional briefings, and more—found no violations of law, policy, or EO had occurred.<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/717864/cia-nypd-ig.pdf)</sup></sup> 

- On September 23, 2001, President Bush signed EO 13224 in response to terrorism. It imposed effective economic sanctions on, among others, persons who have committed, pose a significant risk of committing, or support terrorism.<sup>[1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822037824877&view=1up&seq=194)</sup></sup> 

### Post-9/11 Surveillance authorities
- Pundits, conspiracy theorists & laypeople have misunderstood & perpetuated many myths on surveillance activities of the FBI & NSA after the terrorist attack on 9/11. Broadly: They claim they're illegal & unconstitutional; the Patriot Act weakened privacy protections, backdoor/reverse searches & collected all data on everyone with no warrants, & that this was proven by Snowden.

- Jeffrey Sterling contacted a reporter in early 2003, claiming that the CIA incidentally aided Iran's nuclear weapons development in a covert program. The NYT declined to run the story because of concerns for the safety of human sources. Sterling had a personal axe to grind against the CIA, as he alleged that he was racially discriminated against by colleagues. However, an independent investigation found this allegation baseless. He took this issue to court, but backed off when the Court said it would require CIPA to review classified information—he clearly knew he didn't have a case. As for the core operation itself: A Russian scientist had been an asset for the CIA since 1994—by 1998, the CIA began plans to deceive Iran's nuclear program via the following: Merlin provided designs on Soviet nuclear weapon parts such as the fire set. From there, CIA examined the design and altered many components to cause total failure. The goal was to delay Iran's covert WMD program. The design plans were then prototyped and tested by two independent teams unaware of the modifications. The team's collective experience totalled more than 200 years. They then tried to fix the mechanism if they discovered any flaws. Tests were all successful. In 2000, Merlin traveled to Vienna and met with Iranian contacts. The rest of the operation is all classified.<sup>[1](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/govt-exh-399.pdf)</sup></sup> Sterling was last involved in the program in May 2000 and in Jan of 2002, Sterling was fired from the Agency. His allegations that this operation backfired are without merit, as it would be impossible for him to know. In 2006, the journalist he approached, wrote a book, publishing these activities. Merlin and his wife were so concerned that Russia or Iran could discover their identities, and capturing them for torture and kill them, the wife would jump in fear at every little noise at night.<sup>[2](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/govt-exh-406.pdf#page=32)</sup></sup> Thankfully, Sterling lost the appeal and spent years in prison for this serious breach of ethics and obstruction of justice. <sup>[3](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/sterling/062217-appeal.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Over the years, it has been alleged by conspiracy theorists that the CIA has misled Congress on various matters. One such cited example is the case of Richard Barlow, a Foreign Affairs Specialist while at DoD. In 1993, a Congressionally-mandated Joint Inspectors General investigation between CIA, DoD and State, found that 1. He had made no such disclosure to Congress, but said Congress was misled to a coworker. 2 He was not terminated from his position for allegedly making a disclosure to Congress, suffering reprisal—that the decision for employment termination was made well before the alleged disclosure took place. 3. That the allegation was in error in the first place. "The OIG report concluded that no one at CIA or the NIC ever deliberately provided false or misleading information to Congress regarding Pakistan's nuclear program." It also found, "on those few occasions when an Agency or NIC officer may have made an honest misstatement during Congressional testimony, the Agency quickly corrected the record without prompting from any other quarter."
While the GAO review, while not saying the Joint report was wrong, suggests its logic wasn't fully supported by the evidence. However, the GAO failed to address the criticism by management that points out, as previously stated, that the termination decision had already been made prior to the communication.<sup>[1](https://sgp.fas.org/jud/statesec/barlow-tenet.pdf#page=13)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20081211034006/http://archive.gao.gov/paprpdf1/158991.pdf)</sup></sup>

- Ruby Ridge. Conspiracy theorists claim that the terrorist was targeted by ATF for his beliefs, and that they deliberately killed for "muh reasons." However, an independent DOJ investigation of the episode, both the showdown and the initial investigation confirm this wasn't the case. This investigation did find issues in the FBI's handling of the initial investigation, but found, "no evidence that these deficiencies were international or that the FBI staged evidence for the prosecution's benefit." It also found issues with Assistant AG Ronald Howen taking questionable acts, it recommended that the Executive Office for US Attorneys examine their findings. However, overall, "this investigation found no evidence that BATF improperly targeted Weaver because of his religious or political beliefs." The investigation also examined the snipers. "an FBI sniper/observer fired two shots in quick succession. The first shot was at an armed adult male whom he believed was about to fire at a HRT helicopter on an observation mission. The first shot wounded Randy Weaver while in front of a building at the Weaver compound known as the birthing shed. The second shot was fired at Harris while Harris was retreating into the Weaver cabin. The second shot seriously wounded Harris and killed Vicki Weaver who was behind the cabin door. It is our conclusion that the sniper/observer who took the second shot intended to shoot Kevin Harris but accidentally killed Vicki Weaver whom he did not see behind the curtained door."<sup>[1](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opr/legacy/2006/11/09/rubyreportcover_39.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1993, a cultist group known as the Branch Davidians, engaged the law enforcement as they attempted to serve a search and arrest warrant on the ranch.
  Conspiracy theorists and pundits have claimed it was the ATF that caused the fire. This has been debunked in the official and independent [investigations](https://www.justice.gov/archives/publications/waco/report-deputy-attorney-general-events-waco-texas):
  
  "The arson team concluded that the fire was deliberately set by one or more persons inside the compound. The fire had three separate points of origin. The arson investigation established that those fires occurred in areas significantly distant from one another, but within such a short time frame that it was not possible for the fire to have been accidentally set or for it to have been caused by a single ignition.

  The arson team then discussed those factors that enhanced the spread of the fire. First, the team noted that the compound building had been poorly construction, with apparently no attention to fire safety. The team noted that the building "appears to have been built with a total disregard to any reasonable concern for fire prevention, especially considering its intended use as living quarters for numerous people."

  Second, the arson team attributed the rapid spread of the fire to the strong winds prevailing on April 19.

  Third, the arson team found that the openings created in the building's structure by the FBI during the six hours of the tear gas operation also helped vent the fire. However, the team also noted that the FBI's actions would have allowed more fresh air to flow through the structure while it was burning, thereby reducing the concentration of carbon monoxide and permitting more "breathable" air to reach those trapped inside.

  Fourth, the unusually large amount of combustible material stored inside the compound contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.

  Finally, the absence of fire suppression was a minor factor. The arson team explained that given a fire of this intensity and magnitude, it would have been difficult for a fire fighting team to have halted the fire. 

  Finally, the arson team addressed whether the fire could have been started by the FBI's deployment of tear gas into the compound. The team concluded that "the fire was not caused by nor was it intensified by any chemicals present in the tear-gassing operations." The team noted that the two methods used to deliver the gas were non-incendiary. The pressurized gas delivered through the combat engineering vehicles was sprayed through a nozzle using carbon dioxide as the propellant. The team noted that carbon dioxide would be incapable of igniting, and might even have acted as a fire inhibiting agent. The other method -- 40 mm Ferret cartridges delivered by an M79 hand-held launcher containing a nonburning, nonexplosive liquid agent containing methylene chloride as the carrier -- could not have had any incendiary effect either.

   The arson team likewise concluded that, given the multiple simultaneous points of origin, the fire could not possibly have been started by a ferret round entering a window and knocking over a container of flammable liquid. Moreover, the arson team concluded (contrary to a theory that has been advanced by certain people) that the fire could not have been started by one of the combat engineering vehicles rupturing a propane container and igniting it. If that had happened, according to the report, "an immediate vapor air explosion or flash fire would have occurred involving the vehicle itself. It did not happen." 
 
   The Fire Development Analysis:
 
   In addition to the arson investigation, which focused on the cause and origin of the fire, two experts from the University of Maryland's Department of Fire Protection Engineering traveled to Waco to investigate how the fire had developed and spread. Those two experts prepared a written "Fire Development Analysis" dated September 8, 1993. They reached the following conclusions:

   1. The fires in each of the three points of origin grew very quickly, each resulting in full room involvement within two minutes of initiation.
   2. The rapid growth rates of the fires resulted from an ignition source, probably liquid fuel, deliberately placed in each of the three points of origin.
   3. The rapid growth rates of the fires could not have been caused by a CEV accidentally tipping a lantern, nor by the chemical (methylene chloride) used as the dispersal agent for the CS tear gas.
   4. The strong winds did not significantly affect the fire growth rates inside the compound. The wind affected the external spread of flames, but not the initial rapid growth of the three fires to full room involvement.
   5. The tank-made openings on the first floor of the compound could have had some effect on the fire growth, but more likely provided fresh air to areas of refuge for some of the occupants.
   6. The compound residents had sufficient time to escape the fire, if they had so desired."

- Conspiracy theorists allege that the CIA was behind, and covered-up for a pedo cult, known as "the Finders". However, contrary to their claims, declassified FBI records debunk this notion.<sup>[1](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7x53vg/the-finders-cult-from-the-80s-was-patient-zero-for-epstein-and-pizzagate-conspiracies)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://apnews.com/article/4c5cd8141e930159ea3e4f0492a41ade)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders)</sup></sup>

- Between 1974 and 75, it was alleged that the US Indian Health Service engaged in a forced sterilization effort against the natives without their consent. However, an independent 1976 GAO investigation [found](https://www.gao.gov/assets/hrd-77-3.pdf) this allegation baseless. Concluding:
  - We found no evidence that IHS sterilising Indians without a patient consent form on file, although we did find several weaknesses in complying with HEW's sterilization regulations. The primary weaknesses related to (1) sterilization of persons under 21 years of age, (2) inadequately documenting what the Indian subjects were told before singing the consent form (largely attributable to the the use of consent forms that failed to meet HEW standards), (3) lack of widespread physician understanding of the regulations, and (4) the lack of definitive requirements for informed consent when sterilizations are performed by contract doctors at contract facilities."

- Conspiracy theorists claim that the FBI/local Police assassinated Fred Hampton.
On November 1969, black panther extremists shot and killed two police officers and wounding several more. The FBI obtained information that the extremist group had a stockpile of various items at 2337 West Monroe Street, Chicago.  5 carbines with 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 gas masks, 3 smoke bombs, 5 Ithaca riot shotguns plus ammunition, 4-38 caliber handguns plus ammunition and one .357 magnum plus ammunition. Additional information came in that there included illegal weapons and stolen Police weapons. The Police/FBI had no knowledge that Hampton was present. A Grand Jury investigation, which examined all investigations, autopsies, toxicology reports, and testimony found that the assassination theory to be without merit: The autopsy conducted by Dr. Petty at the Shreveport Louisiana Veterans Hospital, with Grand Jury attorneys present, was extraordinarily thorough. An X-ray study of the entire body was made, and color and black and white photographs were taken at every stage of the examination. This autopsy conclusively confirmed the findings of the FBI and the coroner's chemist that there was no trace of drugs in the body through extensive cultural analyses of the stomach, kidneys, liver, brain and other organs; samples of these organs were contemporaneously obtained by the Hampton family pathologist and the coroner's pathologists." This report finds that the justification for the search warrant was narrow and not politically motivated. This Earth-shattering report also refutes the family and Panther "investigations," by pointing out their bias, "The Black Panther Party investigation also included the retention of a private pathologist who on December 5, 1969, performed a second autopsy on the body of Fred Hampton. Again, before beginning his work, this pathologist was briefed as to the defense theory that Hampton was intentionally murdered... One of the significant impressions the Grand Jury obtained from parts of the investigation conducted by the survivors' attorneys—and, indeed, from parts of the official investigation as well-was the extent to which the predisposition of the individuals conducting the investigations affects the result. Any investigation that is designed to prove a theory rather than establish the facts has to be thoughtfully scrutinized and should not be accepted as objective without such scrutiny...This mistake combined with the mistaken drug analysis, the erroneous classification of the shoulder wound as a graze, the confusion over the recovery of a bullet by the coroner and the defense counsels' predilection for accusatory press conferences, contributed significantly to exacerbating community tension. Plainly, a careful and objective approach to the second autopsy could have prevented this unnecessary conflict over the cause of death." The report also examines the FBI and other forensic studies of the scene, and finds that while on other matters, the Officer's testimony are corroborated by evidence, on ballistics—it does not. It is confirmed that the occupants fired the first shot from the shotgun, there was confusion among the officers in the dark apartment, leading them to conclude that the shots fired from other officers in response to the shotgun were coming from the panthers. It was determined that only one shot, the shotgun, was fired from the panthers. These findings are what caused the Government to conclude the indictments be dismissed against the remaining survivors in the interest of justice. It should be noted, as the report finds: These survivors could have provided valuable insight into what happened, however, they refused to testify.<sup>[1](https://ia601200.us.archive.org/18/items/Grand-Jury-Fred-Hampton-1970/Hampton.-1970-FGJ-Report.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1968, Martin Luther King (MLK) Jr was assassinated by James Earl Ray. Some allege that the FBI or CIA were involved in his death, in part, because of allegations made prior to, and ruled on in a 1999 Civil lawsuit. However, an extensive investigation ordered by DOJ and released in June 2000, which conducted its own original investigation—and examined all prior investigations found these allegations and ruling as baseless, flawed and in error.<sup>[1](https://www.justice.gov/crt/united-states-department-justice-investigation-allegations-regarding-assassination-dr-martin)</sup></sup> HSCA also investigated allegations that the Government (Federal, State and local), were involved in MLK's assassination. HSCA concluded none of the proffered evidence supported the claim, "No Federal, State or Local Government Agency was Involved in the Assassination of Dr. King."<sup>[2](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-1)</sup></sup> HSCA also independently confirms the DOJ's 1977 Task Force report on FBI's interactions with MLK. "The Task Force concluded, however, that the evidence was overwhelming that Ray was a lone assassin, and it found no evidence of FBI involvement."<sup>[3](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081247391&view=2up&seq=1)</sup></sup>

- It is alleged by conspiracy theorists that between 1967 and 1974, Operation CHAOS, a CIA foreign intelligence program, was actually a domestic spy program aimed at disrupting First Amendment activities of US citizens. However, the declassified records contradict this claim outright. "CHAOS was a foreign intelligence collection program, aimed at assessing foreign intelligence interference in the dissident movements. A handful of officers incidentally did end up acquiring such information while they were in the United States bolstering their dissident credentials. There is no indication, however, that anyone connected to Operation CHAOS utilized clandestine means, such as electronic surveillance, wiretaps, or break-ins, to acquire any of this information. When then CIA Director Richard Helms informed President Johnson that the Agency could not spy on Americans, President Johnson stated: 'I'm quite aware of that. What I want for you is to pursue this matter, and to do what is necessary to track down the foreign communists who are behind this intolerable interference in our domestic affairs.' It appears that the Agency did just that-focusing not on the domestic facets of the movement, but rather on the connection of foreign entities to it. As the Rockefeller Commission found the program to be lawful, "the subject matter of the information and not the location of its source is the principal factor that determines whether it is within the purview of the CIA. As one scholar finds, in his careful, thorough, and incisive study reveals: "Applying this to Operation CHAOS under the Act as it existed in 1973, most of the activities undertaken by the Agency were entirely legal. The stated purpose of the Agency's activities in tracking dissident movements was to determine the foreign influences, if any, on those movement. Thus, the purpose was not to collect domestic information, nor to collect information for the purpose of prosecution (i.e., law enforcement), but rather for foreign intelligence purposes. The collection therefore fell within the confines of the Act and was entirely permissible. The Rockefeller Commission came to the same conclusion."<sup>[1](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj#page=48)</sup></sup>

- In 1967, Soviet disinformation outlet, Il Paese Sera, claimed that it was the CIA that was behind the assassination of JFK. This classic case of Russian fake news has been refuted by several Congressional investigations, the DOJ, FBI and outside forensic experts.<sup>[1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Lie-That-Linked-CIA-to-the-Kennedy-Zelikow-Holland/1ba2b788218120e9e205ae7d9bb1877cdb3cb405)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://theconversation.com/jfk-conspiracy-theory-is-debunked-in-mexico-57-years-after-kennedy-assassination-148138)</sup></sup> The Warren Commission and HSCA both concluded no involvement on behalf of the US Government agencies, Cubans or Soviet Union.<sup>[3](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-1)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](https://ia800705.us.archive.org/30/items/COUNTERINGCRITICISMOFTHEWARRENREPORT/COUNTERING%20CRITICISM%20OF%20THE%20WARREN%20REPORT.pdf)</sup></sup> However, the HSCA believed there was evidence of a second shooter.<sup>[5](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1c.html)</sup></sup> This was concluded based on flawed acoustic analysis. The National Academy of Sciences independently refuted this finding.<sup>[6](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10264/chapter/2)</sup></sup> However, the NAS report suffered few minor issues. Subsequently, a landmark study from 2005 corrected those issues from the NRC report, and its findings ultimately supported it. "Our present studies not only affirm the NRC Panel's conclusion but make an even stronger case by: correcting errors; removing the two objective criticisms to the HOLD crosstalk (i.e., those based on the dispatcher's time annotations and on the timing incompatibility of a HOLD crosstalk with a putative CHECK crosstalk); and showing that the analyses of Channel 2 based on the FBI copy (Track 7) agree with those based on the Bowles copy (Tracks 2 and 3), provided that the proper time correction factors K obtained using AC hum and spectrographic pattern cross-correlation are applied. We affirm the NRC conclusion "that the impulses attributed to gunshots were recorded about one minute after the President had been shot and the motorcade had been instructed to go to the hospital. We also show that if, instead, the HOLD synchronization is ignored and the "YOU . . . Stemmons" synchronization is used, the first sounds alleged to be from shots occur at least 30 s after the assassination. Most fundamentally, as emphasized in the NRC report, once one has established "Hold everything secure . . ." as a valid crosstalk in its proper position (no "overdub" involving a skipback on the Channel 1 recording), then no further timing analysis is needed to show that the impulses were not the assassination shots, because they overlap in time with "Hold . . . ,"which by its meaning could only have been uttered after the assassination was recognized."<sup>[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1355030605716683)</sup></sup>

  Did JFK say, "splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.” Most likely not. Versions of the quote goes as far back as 1819 and 1840. While the phrase comes into full in 1916 by British author John Buchan, "Make no mistake, Madam; that folly is over. I will tear this sacred garment into a thousand pieces and scatter them on the wind." The reference to CIA and JFK comes from an anonymous source in the NYT.<sup>[8](https://books.google.com/books?id=Iks4AQAAMAAJ&q=%22a+thousand+pieces+and+scatter%22&dq=%22a+thousand+pieces+and+scatter%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRxsyi7svSAhWJ5CYKHYcqAvU4ChDoAQg3MAY)</sup></sup> <sup>[9](https://books.google.com/books?id=SxwEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22Scatter+it+to+the+winds+of+heaven%22&source=bl&ots=0rth20prXe&sig=e_ee-YwteX_CQy3t1_sjU_3Z9Rc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQtOb28cvSAhWFRSYKHenjDvQ4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22Scatter%20it%20to%20the%20winds%20of%20heaven%22&f=false)</sup></sup> <sup>[10](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Greenmantle/Chapter_21)</sup></sup> <sup>[11](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP75-00001R000200520008-1.pdf)</sup></sup> 
  
  The other quote conspiracy theorists attribute to JFK, “There’s a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot.”  does not exist. This was never said. “We’ve been asked about this quote (and a few variations of it) many times and we’ve never found any evidence that John F. Kennedy said or wrote it,” Stacey Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, wrote in an email to the AP.

  Marc Selverstone, an associate professor at the University of Virginia and chair of the Presidential Recordings Program, has also seen this quote circulate many times and told the AP that he has never seen it in a reputable source.

  Chandler explained that the quote is often claimed to have come from a speech Kennedy supposedly gave at Columbia University in November 1963, either on Nov. 15 or Nov. 12. However, there is no indication Kennedy ever spoke at Columbia University on these dates or any other time in 1963, she said. Staff at the presidential library have also searched for the quote across archival documents, historical newspaper coverage and speech databases like The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “We haven’t found a match for this statement through any of these resources or via cited secondary sources,” said Chandler.

  John Woolley, the co-director of The American Presidency Project, told the AP that he couldn’t find evidence of the Kennedy quote in the collection, either. “In his public remarks there is nothing at all resembling this statement in the period from November 12-14,”<sup>[12](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-JFK-fake-quote-conspiracy-theory-672501330708)</sup></sup>
  
- From 1963 to 1973, a leading endocrinologist, Dr. Carl Heller, studied radiation's affects male reproductive function. ACHRE, "in its own analysis of the risks incurred by the Oregon and Washington testicular irradiation subjects based on a 600-rem dose, which was the maximum testicular exposure of any subject in either state. For purposes of this analysis we assumed that the testicles have average radiation sensitivity; that there is a linear relationship between cancer incidence and dose, and that there is a linear relationship between the risk of cancer and the amount of tissue exposed. Using these assumptions, we calculated that it would take more than double the dose received by any prisoner-subject to yield an effective dose of 1 rem. This means that the predicted increase over the expected cancer rate for the individuals who received the greatest exposure would be less that four-hundreths of 1 percent. For those who received smaller doses of radiation, the risk would, of course, be smaller, too.<sup>[1](https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap9_2.html)</sup></sup>  
  
- From 1962 to 1973, DoD conducted studies on potential risks to U.S. warships and American forces from chemical and biological warfare agents, known as Project 112 and Project SHAD. Consent was provided, and no deaths or injuries resulted.<sup>[1](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Project-112-SHAD)</sup></sup>  
  
- Between 1956 and 1971, the FBI conducted a series of lawful activities, under COINTELPRO—in response to Congressional and public demand for stronger response, to counter and disrupt white supremacist hate groups (such as the KKK), black and far left extremist groups, who were engaged in violent activity aimed against the government, including: bombings, kidnappings, arson and murder. It also countered foreign intelligence services operating in the US, using these groups that declared publicly to, "bring the government to is knees."
It was not a domestic spy operation aimed at political dissidents, as historical revisionists claim. Only a handful of isolated incidents exceeded the FBI's mandate. Care was taken to maintain respect for the First Amendment throughout all activities.<sup>[1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015082035562&view=1up&seq=15&skin=2021)</sup></sup>  

- Some political pundits allege that CIA's first "interrogation manual" condoned torture. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Even as far back as 1958, a Studies in Intelligence article emphasised that  "torture must not be used, the article said, not only for moral and legal reasons but because it risks producing bad information and rendering the subject unfit for further use." It did suggest that “intensive” interrogation occasion ally was needed, a “softening up process" intended to "break" the detainee’s will, but not by crossing the line into physical abuse or torture. “The recalcitrant subject of an intelligence interrogation must be ‘broken,’ but broken for use like a riding horse, not smashed in the search for a single golden egg." A late 60s Studies in Intelligence article reflects a similar warning, that violence "often gets crude results quickly" because it “lowers the moral caliber of the organization employing it and soon corrupts the interrogation staff." As noted by Historian Nicholas Dujmovic, "The evidence suggests CIA took this admonition against physical abuse seriously." Since "in 1960, a CIA employee beat a Soviet bloc defector undergoing interrogation, and DCI Allen Dulles summarily dismissed him." He further observes that, "When coercive methods needed to be used, the strictest
control was the norm." The alleged evidence by historical revisionists, that the CIA condoned torture is the 1963 "Kubark manual", which was more akin to an "academic discussion" of the pros and cons of various interrogation methods—landing on the side against torture. In it, "Most of the discussion concerns psychological stresses, such as the arrest itself, with only a short general discussion on the infliction of pain that emphasizes its potential to be counterproductive. Most interesting is the warning that no CIA interrogator can unilaterally use any form of coercion and that prior approval mu t be obtained from the CIA director." As Dujmovic finds, "Agency experience regarding interrogation goes back more than 50 years, and that
record makes clear two things: first, that coercive methods have always been considered effective to some degree; second, that they have to be used carefully and not devolve into torture."<sup>[1](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/cia%20and%20interrogations-to%5B15490493%5D.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.cia.gov/static/5e897e8297cc9446cc7a884703bcf6ef/Review-The-Good-Shepherd.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Other revisionists contend that the CIA tortured and drugged Soviet defector Yuri Nosenko. However, this never happened. He was subject to bare minimum living conditions—such as denied basic comforts and isolated—but never physically abused or drugged. They also point to the 1983  Human Resource Exploitation (HRE) manual as evidence of CIA's involvement in torture—yet, just like the works before it—explicitly prohibit and call to attention the negative impact of torture and abuse, on the very first page.<sup>[3](https://ia802905.us.archive.org/21/items/CIAHumanResourceExploitationManual_201702/CIA%20Human%20Resource%20Exploitation%20Manual.pdf)</sup></sup>

- A number of myths surround Walter E. Fernald State School, in which sensational allegations claimed residents who were mentally ill were subject to radiation experiments. However, an independent review found the opposite, "Of significant note is that no research was identified by the Task Force that involved testing the effect of radiation on human beings by introducing radioactive materials purposefully into their bodies to measure or monitor such effects. The nutritional research studies used small amounts of radioactive material as tracer elements to understand how the body functioned or obtained elements from the diet; the Thyroid studies used small to large amounts of tracer materials, also to learn about body functions; and, the so-called Cold War study at Wrentham differed in that the tracer materials were used to find the point at which administration of iodine blocked the uptake of radioactive materials that would be found in nuclear fallout."

  Further, it will be stated that many of the people who became residents of the Walter E. Fernald School/ from its opening in 1848 right through the 1950s, were not admitted with a diagnosis of mental retardation. Societal and cultural norms of the day permitted persons to be admitted to state-operated institutions for a number of reasons. All were labeled mentally retarded just by virtue of having lived within the facility. The Task Force asks that the general public and members of the press take special note that these labels are grossly inaccurate, misleading, and simply not true.<sup>[1](https://ia902209.us.archive.org/31/items/reportonuseofrad00mass/reportonuseofrad00mass.pdf)</sup></sup>  <sup>[2](https://ia902203.us.archive.org/15/items/thyroidstudiesfo00mass/thyroidstudiesfo00mass.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1954, the US detonated a series of nuclear bombs to study their yield. This was part of Operation Castle, near Bikini Atoll. Due to a [miscalculation](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16380885-g1vuWf/16380885.pdf#page=212) there was an increase in radiation output than expected. The US Department of Energy estimated that 253 inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were impacted by the radioactive fallout. It is alleged that the US deliberately used the Marshallese as "ginea pigs" for testing radiation under project 4.1. This allegation has been thoroughly investigated and is not supported by any evidence. [Operation Castle had no biomedical program](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16061854-leUIeE/16061854.pdf#page=5). US Military personnel were also exposed to large amounts of radiation, when they thought they were in safe areas of the _expected_ yield.

- Between 1953 to 1973, the CIA with the United States Postal Service (USPS), operated a mail program to "give United States intelligence agencies insight into Soviet intelligence activities and interests." This took place primarily in New York. While some point to the Rockefeller Commission as suggesting this program was unlawful, a renowned scholar notes, "A more extensive analysis of the program, however, indicates that the mail cover portion of the program was legal throughout its duration, while the mail opening portion was legal during its peak years, and may have been since its inception." After a detailed examination, concludes, Thus, it would appear that the CIA's mail cover program was legal during its operation. It did not violate any criminal or civil statute, constitutional provision, or the National Security Act. In addition, contrary to the unspecified claims made by the Rockefeller Commission, the CIA's mail cover operation did not violate postal service regulations." These findings were independently concluded in a 1977 DOJ review.<sup>[1](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj#page=31)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3540126/CIA-RDP04M01816R000502010009-4-Compressed.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1953, MKULTRA. There exists a rich universe of misleading allegations of MKULTRA, due to pop culture, and propagandists. To concisely and accurately represent the program, I'll quote at length from a declassified overview:

    >"Because of events in the 1940's and early 1950's, including operational reports and Soviet show trials involving Gardinal Mindzenty and others, the Soviet Union was believed to have developed the capability to affect human behavior through the use of drugs. To obtain information on the use of chemical and biological substances and methods to counter the use of behavior influencing drugs, the Agency conducted an  "umbrella project" under which various subprojects were funded. This umbrella project, which was called MKULTRA, continued from 1953 through 1964. Much of the research, only a portion of which involved LSD, was conducted at well-known institutions under the control and direction of researchers at, and in conformance to the standards of, those institutions. The research and its results were generally unclassified and published in the normal manner by those researchers.
 
    >In only three instances was research performed in a manner which would raise questions regarding its ethical/moral propriety. The questionable subprojects involved the use of individuals who were not aware that they were the subjects of a research program or that they were being given a drug. This unwitting testing generally took place in social situations among friends and acquaintances of the researcher. In 1963, after questions were raised within the Agency by the Inspector General about the propriety of these subprojects, they were discontinued. Between 1963 and 1967 some testing of drugs continued, but only on voluntary subjects. In 1967 all projects involving behavior influencing drugs were terminated."<sup>[1](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4328740/CIA-RDP86M00886R000800010039-4.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://info.publicintelligence.net/CIA-MKULTRA-IG.pdf)</sup></sup>

  Conspiracy theorists claim that the CIA conducted radiation experiments on humans, as part of mkultra. However, 3 independent reviews found this was not so. CIA's History Staff conducted the most authoritative investigation onto the matter and found that it had not. This independent finding was corroborated by ACHRE's independent examination, "No evidence was found among the public or classified records to contradict CIA's conclusion that it did not engage in human radiation experiments." And, "Although CIA was a member of the Interagency Working Group on Human Radiation Experiments and possessed documents suggesting CIA involvement with human radiation experimentation, the Advisory Committee has found no evidence to indicate that CIA actually conducted or sponsored such experiments."<sup>[3](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=660)</sup></sup> <sup>[4](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=680)</sup></sup> <sup>[5](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/27/031/27031227.pdf#page=56)</sup></sup> <sup>[6](https://archive.org/details/csi-radiation-review)</sup></sup> <sup>[7](https://sgp.fas.org/library/humexp/appb.htm)</sup></sup> Further, no, the US Government didn't invent LSD. It's a surprise, but people do believe this. No, it was discovered by Albert Hofmann, a Swiss chemist, in 1938.<sup>[8](https://ia801408.us.archive.org/31/items/PSPIGreports/newpspreport%20copy.pdf#page=46)</sup></sup> 

- From 1955 to 1975, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted 50 classified medical studies at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland. The purpose was to evaluate the impact of low-dose chemical warfare agents on military personnel and to test protective clothing and pharmaceuticals. About 7,000 soldiers fully consented and took part in these experiments that involved exposures to more than 250 different chemicals. The National Academies of Science (NAS) reviewed the potential for long-term health effects from these experiments and did not find any significant long-term physical harm, except for some Veterans exposed to larger doses of mustard agents. NAS published these studies under the title of, "Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents," in three volumes dated 1982, 1984 and 1985. A follow-up 2004 study and a 2016 study found, "no significant effects had been observed in the health of test subjects in the years since the tests occurred." No deaths have been attributed to the studies.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20210426012639/https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Chemical-and-Biological-Exposures)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/edgewood-aberdeen/index.asp)</sup></sup>

  - From 1954-1973, the U.S. Army ran Operation Whitecoat. The purpose was to study the defense of bioweapons at Fort Detrick.
    Volunteering for Operation Whitecoat basically resulted in the Service member assignment to Fort Detrick. Assignment to Fort Detrick did not mean that the volunteer automatically participated in human experimentation. There was a distinct process used for each experiment.

    Each medical investigator prepared a protocol that was extensively reviewed and modified to comply with the twelve ethical principles of the Nuremberg Code. (The Nuremberg war crimes trials convicted 23 Nazi doctors of murder. In 1946, Andrew Ivey released his list of ten conditions required for "permissible medical experiments" in healthy subjects, which became known as the Nuremberg Code. These twelve conditions are embodied in the Wilson Memorandum described above.) When a review validated the ethical requirement and scientific validity of an experiment, it was forwarded to Army officials for approval.

    It was at this point that potential volunteers were briefed as a group on the approved protocol. During this briefing, they became familiar with the purpose of the study and the risks and benefits involved. They also attended an interview with a scientist where they could ask questions about the research. Volunteers were encouraged to discuss the study with family members, clergy and personal physicians. After an obligatory waiting period of 24 hours to four weeks (the length depended on the presumed risks of the study), informed consent documents would be signed.

    It must be stressed that Operation Whitecoat soldiers were not required to participate in any study, only to be present for the protocol briefings by principal investigators seeking volunteers. About 20 percent of Operation
Whitecoat volunteers did not participate in any study during their tenure at Fort Detrick.
   
    Further, there has been no documented long-term negative effects or deaths.<sup>[4](https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Frequently-Asked-Questions/Human-Subject-Research-at-Fort-Detrick)</sup></sup>

  In 1947, the US Army received a letter from Dr. Alsoph Corwin. suggesting the humane benefits of using Psychochemicals in war. This planted a seed in the Military, in including the fact that the Soviets had advanced significantly in biological, chemical and radiological warfare research. In the late 1950s, the US Army began testing drugs on consenting service-members, in full accordance with the Nuremberg Code. The record indicates the Army took up Dr. Corwin's suggestion: The noble cause of limiting suffering and death in war, while still incapacitating the enemy's forces. LSD was one such chemical studied for this purpose. <sup>[5](https://archive.org/details/UsArmyInspectorGeneralsReportDaig21-75/1ScanDaig-report0-15/)</sup></sup>
    
- Operation LAC. Despite claims made by Lisa Martino-Taylor in her dissertation, a critical examination of declassified documents she cites, reveals no evidence of a hidden program of radioactive tests in St. Louis that "poisoned" residents, between 1953 and 1965. Nor did the tests that were conducted were "hidden" from the public, "Meetings were held with various city officials of St. Louis for the purpose of completing arrangements for wiresonde and field-test operations. Minor difficulties with the Park Commissioner were ironed out with the completion of the change in city administration. The St. Louis police department was quite cooperative at all times, and the fire department aided in the recovery of a kytoon and thermistor which had become entangled in a tree during gusty winds. Civil Defence and city officials of Winnipeg and surrounding municipalities were exceptionally cooperative in helping to initiate mesometeorological operations in that city. As a result, considerable interest was shown by the press and the public. Nor did these studies target minorities. Indeed, the opposite is true, "Those residents in the How Area contacted for location of sampling equipment in homes were found to be extremely cooperative." The aerosols that were released were all safe.<sup>[1](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0031508.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://archive.org/details/Aerosol-study)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://archive.org/details/st-louis-dispersion-study)</sup></sup>    
    
- After WW2, the United States DoD conducted experiments with radiation on human subjects. An independent review that examined studies and policy from 1944 to 1994 found: Fully informed consent was an essential requirement for human subjects, as well as adequate medical treatment and strict ethics guidance adhered to.

  For example, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the DoD and University of Cincinnati conducted unethical experiments "on more than 90 poor, black, advanced stage cancer patients with inoperable tumors" and that Dr. Eugene Saenger "forged consent forms, and did not inform the patients of the risks of irradiation." However, this couldn't be further from the truth. The research at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCM) examined the effectiveness of using new, deep-penetrating TBI technology to improve the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. During the 1950s and 1960s, the DoD sought information on the biological and clinical features of radiation injury. The DoD funded laboratory studies and psychological tests of cancer patients after they had received TBI and PBI as treatment for their disease. The DoD’s initial objective was to obtain a biological marker of radiation exposure. After 1965, the DoD was also interested in obtaining data on the psychological response to radiation exposure. A total of 88 patients from Cincinnati General Hospital participated in this project. Patient selection criteria required that only individuals with proven metastatic or far-advanced cancer be selected for the studies. In addition, subjects had to be in relatively good nutritional status and, in most cases, have normal hematologic values. These criteria remained relatively constant throughout the twelve years of the study. UCCM researchers also sought patients who had not undergone previous radiation or chemotherapy, had normal kidney function and new, abnormal tissue growth that was not radiosensitive, and were without lymphoma or bronchogenic cancer. According to a 1972 University of Cincinnati review of the project, the demographic distribution of study participants reflected the patient population of the Cincinnati General Hospital.
  
  UCCM researchers determined that TBI and PBI therapies were effective in controlling certain advanced cancers. They reported that the relief effects of radiation treatments compared favorably with results using anticancer drugs or chemotherapy. Delivery of higher radiation doses caused patients to experience blood problems, which included loss of red and white blood cells and platelets. Doctors infused bone marrow early in the post-irradiation period, hoping to prevent these problems. In May 1963, researchers in this project proposed establishing facilities for the withdrawal, storage, and reinfusion of bone marrow. By April 1966, a filtration system for the reinfusion of human bone marrow was completed, and by April 1969, success in bone marrow reinfusion was achieved. The use of this process immediately after radiation therapy minimized the characteristic bone marrow depression associated with higher doses of radiation. The degree of illness following reinfusion was significantly decreased and hospitalization greatly shortened. 
  
  Psychological studies of the patients in the UCCM project began in 1965. The DoD’s objective was to determine the effect of radiation exposure on emotional and intellectual functioning. The tests were designed to take into account the many complex variables that may influence the measurement of these functions after radiation treatment. The tests included the Reitan Trials Test, Cattell’s 16 Personality Factor Test, Wechsler Depression Rating Scale, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the five-minute verbal content test of Gottschalk and Gleser. The researchers found evidence of a decrease in intellectual functioning immediately after radiation. This effect was temporary, and functioning improved markedly within three days.


  In January 1972, the American College of Radiology (ACR) reviewed the science, methodology, and design of the project from a medical point of view to determine if the project conformed to then-contemporary standards for clinical investigations. The ACR report concluded that the UCCM project was validly conceived, stated, executed, controlled, and followed up; the process of patient selection conformed with sound medical practice; and procedures for obtaining patient consent were valid, thorough, and consistent with National Institutes of Health recommendations and the practices of most cancer centers. Also in November 1971, Clifford Grulee, M.D., Dean of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, appointed an Ad Hoc Committee made up of members of the UCCM faculty to review the project. Dr. Grulee asked the committee to review the project’s scientific content, methodology, and data treatment. The committee’s report, released in January 1972, indicated that there were no problems with the project’s scientific content or methodology. In addition, the committee stated that there was no evidence that DASA funding was made contingent on work, ideas, or suggestions proposed by DASA and all information reported to DASA was kept unclassified and publicly available.<sup>[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20210821164345/https://archive.defense.gov/pubs/dodhre/Narratv.pdf)</sup></sup>

- In 1942, after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbour, the US evacuated, from the West Coast, individuals of Japanese descent to temporary assembly centers. This was based on, at the time, military necessity as intelligence was indicating the existence of hundreds of Japanese organizations in California, Washington, Oregon and Arizona which, prior to December 7, 1941, were actively engaged in advancing Japanese war aims. These records also disclosed that thousands of American-born Japanese had gone to Japan to receive their education and indoctrination there and had become pro-Japanese and then had returned to the United States. That's the context for this decision. It has been rightly criticised if going to such lengths were indeed militarily necessary. However, a number of myths persist to this day, to suggest the US lacked care for Japanese people during planning, evacuation and at the new locations. This couldn't be further from the truth. Operations were designed to mitigate impact to their lives—such as [sustainment and protection](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=16&skin=2021&size=125) of property, farmland and more. [Exceptional, adequate medical and sanitation care](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3427811&view=2up&seq=223&skin=2021) was provided during transfer, and at relocation facilities. It's also worth noting that citizens with heritage from Axis nations were also considered, such as German. Of course, Japanese citizens also joined the US military to join the war effort to fight the Japanese imperialism. Their bravery and value were well noted and documented at the time, and still to this day, even during internment.<sup>[1](https://history.army.mil/html/books/nisei_linguists/CMH_70-99-1.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://history.army.mil/armyhistory/AH59newOCR.pdf)</sup></sup> There is a wealth of academic scholarship on the decision to evacuate.<sup>[3](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112041523397&view=2up&seq=1&skin=2021)</sup></sup>

- It has been alleged that the CIA, from 1948 onwards, had an operation called, "mockingbird" as an operation to manipulate media domestically. This is a hoax. As confirmed in the CIA's '[Family Jewels](https://web.archive.org/web/20201101104822/https://www.cia.gov/open/Family%20Jewels.pdf)', all Mockingbird was, was a wiretap on two journalists for a few months as they were suspected of making public some classified information. "During the period from 12 March 1963 to 15 June 1963, this office installed telephone taps on two Washington-based newsmen who were suspected of disclosing classified information..." This activity was also [lawful](https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ilj) at the time, and would be today. 

  Some have confused, and allege that the Church Committee report confirmed this domestic influence operation was real. It did not. It discusses CIA's relationship with about 50 US individuals in media, to collect foreign intelligence, as well as creation of articles to be used at foreign populations, not the US. "They are part of a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence foreign opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of foreign newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets. The CIA has been particularly sensitive to the charge that CIA covert relationships with the American media jeopardise the credibility of the American press and risk the possibility  of  propagandising the U.S. public. Former Director William Colby expressed  this concern: 'We have taken particular caution to ensure that our operations are focused abroad and not at the United States in order to influence the opinion of the American people about  things from a CIA point of view.'"<sup>[1](https://archive.org/details/finalreportofsel01unit/page/192/mode/2up)</sup></sup>
  
- Historical revisionists have long-claimed that the US conducted unethical research on Children with radiation. However, a critical examination of the record reflects this is not so. Although in the 1940s and 1950s there were apparently no written rules of professional ethics for pediatric research in general, there were guidelines for the investigational use of radioisotopes in children. In 1949, the Subcommittee on Human Applications of the Atomic Energy Commission's Isotope Division established a set of rules to judge proposals submitted by researchers for the use of radioisotopes in medical experiments with human subjects, including "normal children."" These standards appeared in the fall 1949 supplement to the AEC's isotope catalogue and price list.
 
  These guidelines did not mention consent--of parents, guardians, or children. Instead, this statement simply discouraged nontherapeutic experiments with children. The guidelines did not, however, suggest that the practice was completely inappropriate; the subcommittee asserted that "important" research using "harmless" levels of radiation dosage with children was acceptable. The crucial terms important and harmless were left undefined. It seems reasonable to expect that "important" pediatric research would address a significant medical problem affecting children or would explore key aspects of normal human physiology-relevant to health promotion or disease Part II prevention— for which research on children is indispensable. By these standards, the twenty-one nontherapeutic radiation experiments with children whose risks we review in the next section of this chapter could all be said to address important questions relevant to pediatric health care. During the 1944-1974 period, there was an explosion of interest in the use of radioisotopes in clinical medicine and medical research, including pediatrics. The twenty-one research projects we review here include only a small number of all those that were likely conducted. These twenty-one do include, however, every nontherapeutic study that was funded by the federal government and fell into our original group of eighty-one pediatric radiation experiments.
  
  All twenty-one projects analyzed in detail involve the administration of radioisotopes to children in order to better understand child physiology or to develop better diagnostic tools for pediatric disease. In this respect, the studies supported by the federal government do not differ from those reviewed that had other funding sources. With the exception of the study at the Wrentham school to evaluate protective measures for fallout, none of the twenty-one experiments reviewed was related to national defense concerns. Seventeen of the twenty-one experiments involved the use of iodine 131 for the evaluation of thyroid function.<sup>[1](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2019/ph241/kumar1/docs/achre-oct95.pdf#page=345)</sup></sup>
  
- The Tuskegee experiment,1932. This has been subject to a lot of disinformation and popular myth. I'll quote at length from a 2005 Lancet Infectious Diseases [article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(05)01286-7/fulltext) that corrects the distorted record on the episode:

   "More than a quarter of black Americans questioned in a recent survey believe that AIDS was produced in a laboratory, and 16% believe that it was created by the US government to control the black population. In attempting to explain why such mistaken notions are so widely held, Laura Bogart, lead author of the study, says: “Conspiracy beliefs stem from current and historical discrimination against blacks in our health-care system, including the Tuskegee syphilis study”. The Tuskegee study has become the archetype of unethical research and racism in medicine. However, by citing Tuskegee, is Bogart merely invoking one set of conspiracy beliefs to explain another?
 
    Between 1932 and 1972, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) studied 600 black men, 399 with untreated latent syphilis and 201 uninfected controls, living around Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. Although there was no study protocol, the purpose of the Tuskegee experiments seems to have been to observe patients with untreated latent syphilis to autopsy and verify the presence or absence of syphilitic destructive lesions. According to a detailed analysis of the Tuskegee study by Robert M White in Archives of Internal Medicine, USPHS officers believed that the study “should forever dispel the rather general belief that syphilis is a disease of small consequence to the negro”.

    Although often reported in the medical literature, it took a 1972 New York Times article to bring the Tuskegee experiment to widespread public attention, following which the study was ended in November of that year. In 1997, President Clinton made a public apology to the participants in the study.

    Many aspects of the conduct of the Tuskegee study are beyond dispute. The men who took part were not told their diagnosis and were misled into believing they were receiving treatment, when in fact most were never adequately treated, even when penicillin became available. However, a pervasive myth that must be dispelled is that patients were deliberately infected with syphilis. The truth is that the infected men had had syphilis for several years at the time they were recruited.

    It is debatable whether the study was racist. All the patients and controls were black (as was 82% of the population of Macon County in 1930), but this was because the study has its origins in earlier work supported by the philanthropic Rosenwald Fund, with the motivation of promoting the welfare of African Americans. Although the Rosenwald Fund decided not to support the Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis, it was endorsed by the Tuskegee Institute—an entirely African-American organisation—and black health-care professionals were involved at all stages of the study. Indeed, as late as 1969, the Macon County Medical Society, consisting mostly of black doctors, agreed to assist the USPHS in continuing the study.

    To describe the Tuskegee study as unethical requires an element of what Richard A Shweder describes as “presentism” (ie, judging past actions on the basis of the standards of today). When the study began, the only treatment for syphilis was the poorly efficacious arsphenamine compounds, and there was no medical consensus on the usefulness of these drugs in latent syphilis. And debate over whether treatment of latent syphilis did more harm than good continued into the early 1950s, well into the era of penicillin availability.

    We should also bear in mind that in the 1930s there were no written standards for experimentation with human beings, and the paternalistic attitude that pervaded medical practice at the time meant that the norms for informing patients about their illness were very different from now. Therefore, it is hard to imagine that a hypothetical institutional review board of the 1930s would have judged the Tuskegee study unethical at its inception. However, principles for research with human beings were adopted by the American Medical Association in 1946, and by the 1950s programmes for penicillin treatment of syphilis were widespread across the USA. Thus, by its 20th anniversary the Tuskegee study had become unethical by the standards of the time—patients should have been informed of their diagnosis and given the option of treatment.

    To use the “Tuskegee effect” to explain the disengagement by many black Americans with the reality of AIDS is perhaps understandable, given the way the study has been popularly interpreted. However, focus-group research shows that the public is able to weigh current concerns against worries about the Tuskegee study. The Tuskegee experiment deserves re-examination, free of our contemporary prejudices, before it is again deployed as a symbol of conspiracy."<sup>[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/224795)</sup></sup> <sup>[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568733/pdf/jnma00185-0122.pdf)</sup></sup> <sup>[3](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1043659608314196)</sup></sup>
    
- In 1942, the US determined that biological attacks from Japan and Germany were possible. The US Federal Government worked with local authorities and academia to develop defensive measures and study vulnerability to such attack.
